四年五月，莽曰：“保成师友祭酒唐林、故谏议祭酒琅邪纪逡，孝弟忠恕，敬上爱下，博通旧闻，德行醇备，至于黄发，靡有愆失。
四年五月，王莽说：“保成师友祭酒唐林和原谏议祭酒琅邪郡人纪逡，孝顺父母，恭敬兄长，对事忠诚，待人仁爱，尊敬朝廷，爱护百姓，广泛通晓古籍，德行纯厚完美，直到老年，没有过失。
In [the period T'ien-feng], the fourth year, in the fifth month, [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "The Libationer for the Masters and Companions [to the Heir-apparent] Guarantor of His Perfection, T'ang Lin, and the former Libationer for the Remonstrants and Consultants, Chi Ch'ün, ([a man] from Lang-yeh [Commandery), have shown] filial devotion, brotherly respectfulness, loyalty, and reciprocity; they have been respectful to their superiors and have loved their inferiors; they have been extensively learned in ancient traditions; their upright characters have been excellent and perfect; and even to old age they have not committed any errors. 

其封林为建德侯，逡为封德侯，位皆特进，见礼如三公。赐弟一区，钱三百万，授几杖焉。”
赐封唐林为建德侯，纪逡为封德侯，都给予特进之位，接见他们的礼仪像接见三公一样。赏赐大宅子一所、钱三百万，授予凭几和手杖的待遇。”
Let [T'ang] Lin be enfeoffed as the Marquis Established Through Virtue and [let Chi] Ch'ün [be enfeoffed as] the Marquis Enfeoffed Through Virtue; the rank of both shall be a Specially Advanced and they shall be received in audience with rites like those of the three highest ministers. They are [each] to be granted one residence, three million cash, and are to be given stools and canes."

六月，更授诸侯茅土于明堂，曰：“予制作地理，建封五等，考之经艺，合之传记，通于义理，论之思之，至于再三，自始建国之元以来九年于兹，乃今定矣。
六月，重新在明堂把象征封国的茅土授予诸侯，说道：“我规划土地制度，封建五等诸侯，根据经典的正文，符合经典的解说，贯通经义的事理，再三思考，再三讨论，自从始建国元年以来到现在快九年了，今天才正式定下来。
In the sixth month, when [Wang Mang] changed [the rites, removing to] the Ming-t'ang the bestowal of earth [enveloped in] quitch grass to nobles [as a token of enfeoffment], he said [in a message], "I have instituted the geographical arrangements and have established and enfeoffed [nobles] in five grades. I have examined them by the canonical books and harmonized them with the written traditions [concerning the classics] and the records, and pervaded them by the principles of right relationships. I have discussed them and pondered over them again and again, from the beginning of the first [year] in [the period] Shih-chien-kuo down to the present, [which is] the ninth year. Now they have however been indeed fixed upon."

予亲设文石之平，陈菁茅四色之土，钦告于岱宗泰社后土、先祖先妣，以班授之。
我亲自设立文石台阶，陈列菁茅和四色泥土，敬谨祷告于泰山、国家宗社、大地之神和先代的祖父祖母，然后颁授它。
I have myself established the [inclined] plane of ornamented stones, I have arranged the three-ribbed quitch-grass and the four-colored earth, and have respectfully given information [of the enfeoffments] to Mount T'ai, to the Grand [Imperial] Mound Altar to the Gods of the Soils, to Sovereign Earth, to my deceased male and female ancestors, in order to publish and transmit [these classical practises. Let] each [noble] go to his state to care for and shepherd his common people in order to accomplish meritorious achievements.

各就厥国，养牧民人，用成功业。
各归各的封国，抚育管教人民，以建立功业。
Let each [noble] go to his state to care for and shepherd his common people in order to accomplish meritorious achievements.

其在缘边，若江南，非诏所召，遣侍于帝城者，纳言掌货大夫且调都内故钱，予其禄，公岁八十万，侯、伯四十万，子、男二十万。”
那些在边境地区或江南一带的诸侯，虽然不是诏令所召唤而被派遣到京城来侍奉皇帝的，纳言掌货大夫权且调拨京城库存金钱发放他们的俸禄，公爵每年八十万钱，侯爵、伯爵每年四十万钱，子爵、男爵每年二十万年俸。”
For those whose [estates] are on the borders or in Chiang-nan, except for those who are summoned by an imperial edict to be sent to wait upon [the Emperor] in the imperial capital, the Grandee in Charge of Goods [subordinate to] the Communicator shall temporarily collect the old [style] cash from the capital treasuries [in order to] pay them their allowances: to dukes, 800,000 [cash] per year; to marquises and earls, 400,000 [cash per year]; to viscounts and barons, 200,000 [cash per year]."

然复不能尽得。
然而还是不能完全得到。
Yet even then they could not receive the full amount.

莽好空言，慕古法，多封爵人，性实遴啬，托以地理未定，故且先赋茅土，用慰喜封者。
王莽喜欢说空话，羡慕古代的制度，多给人赐封爵位，性格其实吝啬，拿土地规划没有确定作为托辞，所以权且先授予象征封国的茅土，用来安慰喜欢封爵的人。
[Wang] Mang loved bombastic speeches and admired ancient practises. He enfeoffed very many people as nobles, [but] in his nature he was in reality niggardly. He took as a pretext that the geographical arrangements had not yet been determined upon, hence temporarily in advance distributed clods with quitch-grass [in token of enfeoffment], using them to console and delight those whom he enfeoffed.

是岁，复明六管之令。
这一年，重申六项财政经济管理制度。
In this year, [Wang] Mang again published ordinances for the six controls.

每一管下，为设科条防禁，犯者罪至死，吏民抵罪者浸众。
每一项管理制度下达，总要为它设置法令条规来加以防范，违犯的人最重的罪甚至被处死，官吏和平民犯罪受罚的更加多了。
For each control he established regulations to restrain violators [of the monopoly]; the penalties were as great as capital [punishment. Yet] the officials and common people who suffered for crime became increasingly numerous.

又一切调上公以下诸有奴婢者，率一口出钱三千六百，天下愈愁，盗贼起。
又对上公以下凡蓄养了奴婢的一律征税，都是每一个奴婢出三千六百钱，天下人更加怨恨，盗贼兴起。
He moreover temporarily made a levy [even] upon the highest class of the highest ministers [and those ranking] lower, that whoever possessed male or female slaves should pay a tax of 3600 cash per [slave], so that the empire became even more discontented and thieves and robbers arose.

纳言冯常以六管谏，莽大怒，免常官。
纳言冯常就六项管理制度的问题进行了规劝，王莽大怒，免去了冯常的官职。
When the Communicator, Feng Ch'ang, remonstrated against the six controls, [Wang] Mang became furious and dismissed [Feng] Ch'ang from office.

置执法左右刺奸。
设置执法左刺奸和执法右刺奸。
[Wang Mang] established Administrators of the Laws at [the Emperor's] Right and Left for the Extirpation of Wickedness.

选用能吏侯霸等分督六尉、六队，如汉刺史，与三公士郡一人从事。
选用能干的官吏侯霸等人分别督察六尉和六队，职权像汉朝的刺史一样，随带三公办事人员每郡一人处理有关事项。

临淮瓜田仪等为盗贼，依阻会稽长州，琅邪女子吕母亦起。
临淮郡瓜田仪等人作盗贼，盘踞会稽郡城长州苑，琅邪郡妇女吕母也起事。
Kua-t'ien Yi of Lin-huai [Commandery] and others became thieves and robbers, relying upon [the fastnesses in] Ch'ang-chou of K'uai-chi [Commandery]. Mother Lü, a woman of Lang-yeh [Commandery], also arose.

初，吕母子为县吏，为宰所冤杀。
起初，吕母的儿子作县吏，被县长冤枉杀死。
Previously, Mother Lü's son had been an official of the county and had been killed on a false charge by its Ruler.

母散家财，以酤酒买兵弩，阴厚贫穷少年，得百余人，遂攻海曲县，杀其宰以祭子墓。
吕母拿出家中财产，用来买酒肉、武器，秘密地优待贫穷小伙子，得到了一百多人，便进攻海曲县，杀死了县长去祭她儿子的坟墓。
His mother dispersed the wealth of her household on [the pretext] of dealing in liquor, by purchasing arms and crossbows, and privately treating poor youths liberally. When she had obtained more than a hundred men, she thereupon attacked the county-seat of Hai-ch'ü and killed its Ruler. She used [his corpse] as a sacrifice at the grave of her son.

引兵入海，其众浸多，后皆万数。
然后带兵到海上活动，她的队伍逐渐壮大，后来共有上万人。

莽遣使者即赦盗贼，还言：“盗贼解，辄复合。
王莽派遣使者就地赦免盗贼，使者回来说：“盗贼解散了，时常又会合拢来。
[Wang Mang] sent commissioners to go to and pardon the thieves and robbers. When [the commissioners] returned, they said, "Whenever the thieves and robbers disperse, they immediately reunite."

问其故，皆曰愁法禁烦苛，不得举手。
询问他们原由，都说苦于禁令烦琐苛刻，不能行动。
When he asked them the reason for this [action], they all said, "They are grieved at the laws and prohibitions, which are vexatious and tyrannous, so that they can do nothing。

力作所得，不足以给贡税。
努力耕作的收入，不够用来缴纳赋税。
what they obtain by hard work is insufficient to pay the taxes。

闭门自守，又坐邻伍铸钱挟铜，奸吏因以愁民。
关着门安分守己，又会受到邻居私自铸钱和私藏铜的连累，奸吏藉以勒索人民。
while if they close their doors in order to guard themselves, they are moreover sentenced because their group of five neighboring [families] might be casting cash or possessing copper. Wicked officials take advantage of that to afflict these common people."

民穷，悉起为盗贼。”
人民走投无路，只好都起来作盗贼。”
When common people are impoverished, they all arise and become thieves or robbers."

莽大怒，免之。
王莽大怒，免掉他们的官职。
[Wang] Mang [became] furious and dismissed them.

其或顺指，言“民骄黠当诛”。
其中有的人顺着他的意图，说“乱民骄纵狡猾，应当惩办”。
Some of them fell in with his ideas and said that the common people were perverse and crafty and ought to be executed。

及言“时运适然，且灭不久”，莽说，辄迁之。
还说“时运合该如此，不久就会消灭的”，王莽就高兴，总是提拔他们。
and also said that the revolution of the seasons was opportune and [the robbers] would before long be annihilated, [whereupon Wang] Mang was pleased and immediately promoted them.

是岁八月，莽亲之南郊，铸作威斗。
这年八月间，王莽亲自去南郊，铸造威斗。
In this year, in the eighth month, [Wang] Mang in person went to the place for the suburban sacrifice at the south [of the Capital] to have the majestic tou [measures] cast.

威斗者，以五石铜为之，若北斗，长二尺五寸，欲以厌胜众兵。
威斗是用铜掺进五色石子铸成的，形状像北斗，长二尺五寸，想要用来威慑各部农民军。
For making the majestic tou [measures], five [colors of] minerals were used with bronze. They were like the Northern Bushel [in shape], two feet five inches long. [Wang Mang] intended to use them to repress various military forces by incantations.

既成，令司命负之，莽出在前，入在御旁。
威斗铸成了，让司命扛着它，王莽外出它就在前头，王莽进宫就把它放在身旁。
When they were completed, he ordered the Directors of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles] to carry them on their shoulders. When [Wang Mang] went out, they went before him; when he had entered [the palace], they waited upon him at his sides.

铸斗日，大寒，百官人马有冻死者。
铸造威斗的那天，天气特别冷，百官人马有冻死的。
On the day that these tou [measures] were cast, there was a severe cold [spell], so that some men and horses of the various offices froze to death.

五年正月朔，北军南门灾。
五年正月初一，北军营垒的南门发生了火灾。
In the fifth year, the first month, on the first day of the month, there was a visitation [of fire] to the southern gate of the Northern Army [Encampment].

以大司马司允费兴为荆州牧，见，问到部方略，兴对曰：“荆、扬之民率依阻山泽，以渔采为业。
任命大司马司允费兴作荆州牧，王莽接见他，询问他达任所以后的计划方案，费兴回答说：“荆州、扬州的人民大都依靠山林湖沼，以捕鱼、樵采作为职业。
Fei Hsing, the Director of Confidence in the Commander-in-chief, was made the Shepherd of Ching Province. When he was asked at an audience what would be his plans of action when he reached his regional division, [Fei] Hsing replied, "The common people of Ching and Yang [Provinces] generally take advantage of their mountains and marshes in making fishing and the picking [of wild fruits] their occupations."

间者，国张六管，税山泽，妨夺民之利，连年久旱，百姓饥穷，故为盗贼。
前一段时间，国家推行六管制度，征收山林湖沼税，损害、剥夺了人民的利益，加上连年久旱，百姓饥饿穷困，所以流为盗贼。
Recently the state has set up the six controls, which tax [the products of] the mountains and marshes and have interfered with and taken away the profits of the common people. For a long time in successive years there have been droughts, so that the people are hungry and impoverished. Hence they have become thieves or robbers."

兴到部，欲令明晓告盗贼归田里，假贷犁牛种食，阔其租赋，几可以解释安集。”
我到达任所以后，想要下令明白晓谕盗贼返回家园，贷放农具、耕牛、种子、粮食，减免他们的赋税，希望可以解散、安抚他们。”
"When I, Hsing, reach my regional division, I intend to order and to make it clearly known and inform the thieves and robbers that they should return to their homes and I will lend them oxen for plowing, seed, and food, and exempt them from the land and capitation-taxes. I hope that thereby I may be able to disperse and tranquillize them."

莽怒，免兴官。
王莽发怒，免掉了费兴的官职。
[Wang] Mang became incensed [at this proposal] and dismissed [Fei] Hsing from his office.

天下吏以不得奉禄，并为奸利，郡尹县宰家累千金。
全国的官吏因为得不到俸禄，纷纷去牟取非法利益，郡尹县宰家产积累上千斤金。
Because the officials of the [whole] empire did not receive their salaries, they all did evil for profit. The personal property of [Grand] Governors of commanderies and Rulers of counties [amounted to] a thousand [catties of] gold.

莽下诏曰：“详考始建国二年胡虏猾夏以来，诸军吏及缘边吏大夫以上为奸利增产致富者，收其家所有财产五分之四，以助边急。”
王莽下诏书说：“彻查始建国二年匈奴扰乱中原以来，所有军官和边境官吏大夫以上牟取非法利益增加产业发了财的，没收他们家中所有财产的五分之四，用来帮助边防的急需。”
[Hence Wang] Mang issued an imperial edict which said, "Investigate carefully [the deeds of] the military officials and the officials of the borders, from the grandees and upwards, beginning with the second year of [the period] Shih-chien-kuo, when the northern barbarian (Hu) caitiffs troubled China. If any have done evil for profit, so that they have increased their property and have become rich, [let] four-fifths of the property in their families be taken and used to aid the distress of the borders."

公府士驰传天下，考覆贪饕，开吏告其将，奴婢告其主，几以禁奸，奸愈甚。
各公府办事人员乘坐传车跑遍全国，仔细审查贪污案件，动员军官告发他们的将领，奴婢告发他们的主人，希望用这样的办法来禁止奸邪，可是奸邪却越加厉害。
Officers from the highest ministers' yamens [rode] galloping quadrigae [all over] the empire, examining and investigating avaricious [persons]. They persuaded officials to inform on their generals, and male and female slaves to inform on their masters, hoping thereby to stop the evil, [but] the evil became very much more serious.

皇孙功崇公宗坐自画容貌，被服天子衣冠，刻印三：一曰“维祉冠存己夏处南山臧薄冰”，二曰“肃圣宝继”，三曰“德封昌图”。
皇孙功崇公王宗由于给自己画了一幅画像，穿着天子的衣服，戴着天子的冠冕，刻了三枚印章：第一枚是“维祉冠，存己夏，处南山，藏薄冰”，第二枚是“肃圣宝继”，第三枚是“德封昌图”，因而犯了罪。
An Imperial Grandson, the Duke of Eminent Merits, [Wang] Tsung, was sentenced for having had a picture of himself painted, wearing the robes and bonnet of the Son of Heaven, and having had three seals engraved. One read, "Because of celestial blessings, my official hat is prepared and ready. In the summer [I] dwell in the Southern Mountains, where there is stored up thin ice." The second read, "Revering the Sages and holding precious the heritage." The third said, "[To be] enfeoffed because of virtue and made glorious by the [imperial] documents."

又宗舅吕宽家前徙合浦，私与宗通，发觉按验，宗自杀。
又王宗的舅父吕宽家以前被流放到合浦郡，暗地里跟王宗联系，被发觉后，审查核实，王宗自杀了。
The household of [Wang] Tsung's maternal uncle Lü K'uan, which had previously been exiled to Ho-p'u [Commandery], had moreover privately communicated with [Wang] Tsung. When [this matter] became known, an examination was made and [Wang] Tsung committed suicide.

莽曰：“宗属为皇孙，爵为上公，知宽等叛逆族类，而与交通；刻铜印三，文意甚害，不知厌足，窥欲非望。
王莽说：“王宗亲属关系是皇孙，爵位是上公，知道吕宽等人是叛逆分子，而竟跟他们来往；刻制铜印三枚，印文的意思很鬼祟，不知满足，觊觎非分的希望。
[Wang] Mang said, "[According to] his relationship, [Wang] Tsung was an Imperial Grandson; [according to] his noble rank, he was [among] the highest of the dukes. He knew that [Lü] K'uan and the others belonged to rebellious clan, but communicated with them. He had three bronze seals engraved whose inscriptions and intentions were extremely pernicious. He did not know how to be contented, and was watching for and desiring what he should not have hoped for."

《春秋》之义，‘君亲毋将，将而诛焉。’迷惑失道，自取此事，乌呼哀哉！
《春秋》的原则是‘对国君和父母不得存恶念，有恶念就要惩罚他’。迷惑得背离了正道，自己犯了这样的罪行，真是可悲呀！
"[According to] the principle in [the Kung-yang Commentary on] the Spring and Autumn, `A relative of the prince should not have had such an intention, [but] since he had that intention, he should have been executed,' [Wang Tsung] was deluded and went astray, so that he brought this punishment upon himself. Alas! It is sad!"

宗本名会宗，以制作去二名，今复名会宗。
王宗本来名叫王会宗，因为制度规定要取消双名，现在恢复原名王会宗。
[Wang] Tsung's personal name was originally Hui-tsung; according to the [imperial] institutions, he had done away with there being two words in his personal name [and used only Tsung as his name]. He was now again named Hui-tsung.

贬厥爵，改厥号，赐谥为功崇缪伯，以诸伯之礼葬于故同谷城郡。”
贬低他的爵位，改变他的名号，赐予谥号叫功崇缪伯，按照伯爵的礼仪安葬在他原来的封国谷城郡。”
and his noble rank was degraded and his title was changed. He was granted the posthumous name of the Erring Earl of Eminent Merits, and was buried with the rites of an earl in his former t'ung in Ku-ch'eng Commandery."

宗姊妨为卫将军王兴夫人，祝诅姑，杀婢以绝口。
王宗的姐姐王妨是卫将军王兴的夫人，祈祷鬼神给她婆母降灾祸，为了灭口杀死婢女。
[Wang] Tsung's elder sister, [Wang] Fang, who was the Lady (wife) of the General of the Guard, Wang Hsinga, had made [magical] imprecations against her mother-in-law and had killed a slave-woman in order to stop up her mouth.

事发觉，莽使中常侍惲{带足}责问妨，并以责兴，皆自杀。
最后事情被发现了，王莽让中常侍惲{带足}责问王妨，并且拿这件事责备王兴，王妨和王兴都自杀了。
The matter became known and [Wang] Mang sent the Regular Palace Attendant Tai Yün to interrogate [Wang] Fang under torture and also to flog [Wang] Hsinga. Both committed suicide.

事连及司命孔仁妻，亦自杀。
事情牵连到司命孔仁的妻子，也自杀了。
The matter also involved the wife of the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], K'ung Jen. She also committed suicide.

仁见莽免冠谢，莽使尚书劾仁：“乘‘乾’车，驾‘神’马，左苍龙，右白虎，前朱雀，后玄武，右杖威节，左负威斗，号曰赤星，非以骄仁，乃以尊新室之威命也。
孔仁见到王莽便摘下帽子请罪，王莽让尚书弹劾孔仁：“坐着绘有天文图像的车子，套着母马，左边是青龙标志，右边是白虎标志，前头是朱雀标志，后头是乌龟标志，右手拿着五威节，左肩扛着威斗，称号叫作赤星，这些都不是用来让孔仁为所欲为，而是用来尊崇新朝的威严命令。
[When K'ung] Jen had audience with [Wang] Mang, and doffed his bonnet in acknowledging [his fault, Wang] Mang had a Master of Writing impeach [K'ung] Jen [saying that the fact of his] "having ridden in a heavenly chariot [drawn by] earthly mares, `having on his left the Azure Dragon [Standard], on his right the White Tiger [Standard], in front the Vermillion Bird [Standard], and in his rear the Dark Warrior [Standard],' in his right hand grasping the majestic credentials and on his left [shoulder] bearing the majestic tou [measure], and being called the Red Planet, was not in order to make [K'ung] Jen proud, but to honor the majestic mandate of the Hsin house."

仁擅免天文冠，大不敬。”
孔仁擅自摘下天文冠，这是犯了不敬皇帝的罪行。”
[and yet K'ung] Jen has presumed to doff his astrological bonnet, which constitutes [the capital crime] of being extremely disrespectful."

有诏勿劾，更易新冠。
王莽又下诏书指示不要弹劾他，更换一顶新帽子就行了。
Thereupon there was an imperial edict [ordering that K'ung Jen] should not be impeached and exchanging his bonnet for a new one.

其好怪如此。
他喜怒无常就像这个样子。
[Wang Mang's] love for marvels was like the foregoing.

以真道侯王涉为卫将军。
任命直道侯王涉作卫将军。
The Marquis of the Straight Path, Wang Shê, was made the General of the Guard.

涉者，曲阳侯根子也。
王涉是曲阳侯王根的儿子。
[Wang] Shê was the son of the Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, [Wang] Ken.

根，成帝世为大司马，荐莽自代，莽恩之，以为曲阳非令称，乃追谥根曰直道让公，涉嗣其爵。
王根在成帝时期担任大司马，曾经推荐王莽接替自己的职务，王莽因此感激他，认为曲阳不是一个美好的名称，才追谥王根为直道让公，让王涉继承了他的爵位。
In the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, [Wang] Ken had been Commander-in-chief, and, [when he had been about to retire], he had recommended [Wang] Mang to take his place [as Commander-in-chief, so that Wang] Mang was grateful to him. [The latter] had considered that Ch'ü-yang (crooked phallus) was not a good designation, so had posthumously [granted Wang] Ken the posthumous name, Duke Jang (Ceding) of the Straight Path. [Wang] Shê had inherited this noble title.

是岁，赤眉力子都、樊崇等以饥馑相聚，起于琅邪，转抄掠，众皆万数。
这一年，赤眉军力子都和樊崇等人由于饥荒而聚集起来，在琅邪郡起事，到处抢劫，部队共有万人。
In this year, Li Tzu-tu, Fan Ch'ung, and others of the Red Eyebrows gathered together because of the famine and arose in Lang-yeh [Commandery]. They moved about and robbed. Their bands all numbered in the ten-thousands.

遗使者发郡国兵击之，不能克。
王莽派遣使者调动郡国地方部队攻打他们，不能取胜。
[Wang Mang] sent commissioners to mobilize the troops of the commanderies and kingdoms to attack them, [but these troops] were unable to vanquish [the robber bands].

六年春，莽见盗贼多，乃令太史推三万六千岁历纪，六岁一改元，布天下。
六年春季，王莽看到盗贼很多，便让太史推算出三万六千年的历法大纲，每六年改一次年号，布告全国。
In the sixth year, in the spring, [Wang] Mang saw that the thieves and robbers were so many, hence ordered the Grand Astrologers to calculate a calendar for thirty-six thousand years, with one change of the year-period [every] six years, and to publish it to the empire.

下书曰：“《紫阁图》曰‘太一、黄帝皆仙上天，张乐昆仑虔山之上。后世圣主得瑞者，当张乐秦终南山之上。’
下文告说：“《紫阁图》说：‘太一和黄帝都成为神仙上天了，在昆仑山的虔山上演奏仙乐。后代获得了祥瑞的英明帝王，应当在秦地终南山上演奏仙乐。’
[Wang Mang] issued a message, saying, "The Tzu-ko T'u says, `The Supreme One and the Yellow Lord both [became] immortals and [then] ascended to heaven, [where they] made music on top of the K'un-lun and Ch'ien Mountains. A sage lord who is of their later generations and is to secure auspicious presages is due [similarly] to have music made upon the top of the Chung-nan Mountains in [the state of] Ch'in.' "

予之不敏，奉行未明，乃今谕矣。
我不聪明，没有自觉地遵行，到现在才懂得了。
"Because of my lack of penetration, my performance of [Heaven's] commands has not been intelligent, yet now I have been informed [of the correct procedure]."

复以宁始将军为更始将军，以顺符命。
再把宁始将军称为更始将军，是顺从符命的意思。
I restore [a former title, changing] the General of a Peaceful Beginning to be the General of a New Beginning, in order to conform to the Mandate [of Heaven given through] portents."

《易》不云乎？‘日新之谓盛德，生生之谓易。’予其飨哉！”
《易经》不是说过吗？‘日日更新就是优秀的品德，在运动变化的过程中不断有新事物产生就叫作“易”。’我会享受这种幸福的！”
Does not the Book of Changes say, `The daily renewing [of nature] is what is called the flourishing of its virtue; its production of what is produced is what is called its change.' May I receive [Heaven's protection]."

欲以诳耀百姓，销解益贼。众皆笑之。
想要用这样的办法来眩惑百姓，消除盗贼。大家都讪笑这些作法。
He wished thereby to deceive and dazzle the people and to scatter and disperse the thieves and robbers, [but] the vulgar all laughed at him.

初献《新乐》于明堂、太庙。
初次向明堂、太庙进献《新乐》。
Previously when the music of the Hsin [House] had been offered in the Grand [Ancestral] Temple of the Ming-t'ang.

群臣始冠麟韦之弁。
大臣们开始戴鹿皮帽子。
when the courtiers had first worn the female unicorn-skin caps.

或闻其乐声，曰：“清厉而哀，非兴国之声也。”
有人听到那音乐的曲调，说道：“凄凉严肃而且低沉，不是振兴国家的音乐。”
someone who heard the sound of this music said, "It is limpid and inspiring, but plaintive, not the music that will make a state flourish."

是时，关东饥旱数年，力子都等党众浸多，更始将军廉丹击益州不能克，征还。
这时候，关东地区接连几年遭到干旱饥荒，力子都等部众逐渐增多。更始将军廉丹攻打益州没能取胜，召回。
At this time, east of [Han-ku] Pass there had been a famine and drought for several years, so that the partizan bands of Li Tzu-tu and the others became gradually larger. When the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, had attacked [the rebels] in Yi Province, he had not been able to vanquish them, hence he was summoned to return in order that someone might be sent in his place.

更遣复位后大司马护军郭兴、庸部牧李晔击蛮夷若豆等，太傅牺叔士孙喜清洁江湖之益贼。
再派复位后大司马护军郭兴和庸部牧李毕去攻打部族首领若豆等，派太傅牺叔士孙喜去平定各地的盗贼。
He was [however] restored to his [former] position [as General of a New Beginning]. Afterwards when Kuo Hsing, [the Commissioner Over] the Army [subordinate to] the Commander-in-chief, and the Shepherd of the Yung Regional Division, Li Yeh, [were sent to] attack the barbarian Jo Tou and others, and the Third Brother Hsi, Sun Hsi, a higher subordinate official of the Grand Tutor, [was sent to] purify the Yangtze valley from thieves and robbers.

而匈奴寇边甚。
同时匈奴侵犯边境很厉害。
and when moreover the Huns raided the borders very seriously.

莽乃大募天下丁男及死罪囚、吏民奴，名曰“猪突豨勇”，以为锐卒。
王莽便大规模招集全国的壮丁以及死刑罪犯和官吏、平民的家奴，起名叫猪突豨勇，把他们作为精锐的士兵。
[Wang] Mang made a great solicitation of the empire's freemen together with those imprisoned for capital crimes and the slaves of the officials and common people. [Those who responded] were called "Boar braves who are porcupines rushing out," and were considered as ardent troops.

一切税天下吏民，訾三十取一，缣帛皆输长安。
一切费用向全国的官吏和平民征收，估量财产抽取三十分之一，绸绢都运送到长安。
[Wang Mang] temporarily taxed the officials and common people of the empire, taking one-thirtieth of their property. Their close-woven waterproof and other silks were all transported to Ch'ang-an.

令公卿以下至郡县黄绶皆保养军马，多少各以秩为差。
命令公卿以下直到郡县佩带黄色印纽的官吏都要保养军马，马匹的多少根据各人的俸禄规定等级。
It was ordered that the ministers and those of lower [rank down] to the [officials] in the commanderies and counties who wore yellow seal-cords should all guarantee the rearing of horses for the army, the number of which [horses] should be proportionate to each [official's] rank.

又博募有奇技术可以攻匈奴者，将待以不次之位。
又广泛招集有奇巧技术可以用来攻打匈奴的专门人才，打算越级提升职位来任用他们。
[Wang Mang] also made a wide solicitation for those who possessed extraordinary skills that could be used to attack the Huns, [saying that] they would be treated [extraordinarily by being given a high] ranking [at once and] not be [promoted only] by degrees.

言便宜者以万数：或言能度水不用舟楫，连马接骑，济百万师；
建议对国家有利的事情的人以万计：有的说能够不用舟船渡过江河，人马连接，可以渡过上百万的军队；
Those who said that [their arts] would be advantageous were numbered by the ten-thousands. One said that he was able to cross streams without using boats or oars; that by joining horses and connecting their riders he could cause an army of a million to ford [rivers].

或言不持斗粮，服食药物，三军不饥；
有的说不要携带一斗粮食，只要服食药物，军队可以不饥饿；
One said that without carrying a measure of grain and by taking drugs, the three [divisions of] an army would not become hungry.

或言能飞，一日千里，可窥匈奴。
有的说能够飞行，一天飞行一千里，可以去侦察匈奴。
One said that he was able to fly a thousand li in a day and so could spy out the Huns.

莽辄试之，取大鸟翮为两翼，头与身皆著毛，通引环纽，飞数百步堕。
王莽就让他试试，那个人拿大鸟的羽毛做成两扇翅膀，头上和身上都附上羽毛，遍身用环形纽带缠绕，飞行几百步就掉下来了。
[Wang] Mang immediately had him try out [his invention]. He took the quills of a large bird to make his two wings; on both his head and his body he stuck feathers. He connected them by pivots. He flew several hundred double-paces [and then he] fell.

莽知其不可用，苟欲获其名，皆拜为理军，赐以车马，待发。
王莽知道他们不能任用，硬要博得珍惜人才的名声，都任命作理军，拿车马赏赐他们，等待出发。
[Wang] Mang knew that these [people] could not be useful, [but] he merely wished to make use of their fame, so he installed them all as Directors of the Army and granted them chariots and horses while they waited [until the army should] set out.

初，匈奴右骨都侯须卜当，其妻王昭君女也，尝内附。
当初，匈奴右骨都侯须卜当，他的妻子是王昭君的女儿，曾经归附中原。
Previously, the Hun Ku-tu Marquis of the West, Hsü-pu Tang, whose wife, [Lüan-ti Yün], was the daughter of Wang [Ch'iang] Chao-chün, had been attached to [the Chinese.

莽遣昭君兄子和亲侯王歙诱呼当至塞下，胁将诣长安，强立以为须卜善于后安公。
王莽派遣王昭君的侄儿和亲侯王歙引诱须卜当到边界，胁迫他来到长安，强迫立他为须卜善于后安公。
Wang] Mang sent the Marquis of Peace and Alliance By Marriage, Wang Hsi, the son of [Wang Ch'iang] Chao-chün's elder brother, to allure and summon [Hsü-pu] Tang to the foot of the barrier and by force made him go to Ch'ang-an, where he was compelled to be set up as the Shan-yü Hsü-pu and the Duke of Future Peace.

始欲诱迎当，大司马严尤谏曰：“当在匈奴右部，兵不侵边，单于动静，辄语中国，此方面之大助也。
起初王莽想要引诱须卜当，大司马严尤规劝道：“须卜当在匈奴右部，他的军队没有侵犯过边境，总是把单于的消息告诉中原，这是一个方面的巨大帮助。
When [Wang Mang] first wanted to allure and receive [Hsü-pu] Tang, the Commander-in-chief, Chuang Yu, had remonstrated, saying, "[Hsü-pu] Tang is in the western section of the Huns where his troops do not invade [the Chinese] borders. Whenever the Shan-yü moves or remains quiet, he immediately [sends] word [of it] to China. [Thus] he is of the greatest assistance in this quarter."

于今迎当置长安槁街，一胡人耳，不如在匈奴有益。”
现在迎接须卜当安置到长安东街，不过一个匈奴人而已，不如让他留在匈奴有利。”
If now you receive [Hsü-pu] Tang and establish him on Kao Street in Ch'ang-an, he will be merely an individual northern foreigner (Hu) and would not be as helpful as if he were among the Huns."

莽不听。
王莽没有听从。
[But Wang] Mang did not listen [to him.

即得当，欲遣尤与廉丹击匈奴，皆赐姓徵氏，号二徵将军，当诛单于舆而立当代之。
已经把须卜当弄来了，想要派遣严尤和廉丹攻打匈奴，都赐姓征氏，称为二征将军，要杀死单于舆而立须卜当去代替他。
When Wang Mang] had secured [Hsü-pu] Tang, he wanted to send [Chuang] Yu with Lien Tan to attack the Huns. He granted both of them the surname Cheng (to make a military expedition), entitling them the Two Generals Making a Military Expedition. They were required to execute the Shan-yü [Lüan-ti] Yü, and set up [Hsü-pu] Tang to take his place.

出车城西横厩，未发。
出兵长安城西马栏，没有起行。
They were to start out from the Kuang Stables at the west of the city.

尤素有智略，非莽攻伐四夷，数谏不从，著古名将乐毅、白起不用之意及言边事凡三篇，奏以风谏莽。
严尤向来具有智谋和才干，反对王莽攻打西方外族，屡次规劝，王莽都没有听从，于是撰述古代名将乐毅和白起不被信任的历史教训以及陈述边疆防务事宜的文章共三篇，上报去委婉曲折地规谏王莽。
Before they started out, [since Chuang] Yu had usually had wise plans and had opposed [Wang] Mang's [project of] attacking the barbarians in the four [quarters], and had remonstrated several times, but [his advice] had not been followed, he composed [a work] in altogether three fascicles, [dealing with] the conception that ancient famous generals, [such as] Yo Yi and Po Ch'i, were [eventually] not employed [by their lords] and also discussing matters [concerning the Chinese] borders, and memorialized [the book] in order to remonstrate with [Wang] Mang.

及当出廷议，尤固言匈奴可且以为后，先忧山东盗贼。
等到廷议，严尤坚决说明匈奴可以权且放在后面，首先要忧虑山东地区的盗贼。
When they were due to start out, in a conference at court, [Chuang] Yu said firmly that the Huns could be temporarily considered as secondary and that the most important concern [of the ruler] should be the thieves and robbers east of the mountains [of Kuang-chung].

莽大怒，乃策尤曰：“视事四年，蛮夷猾夏不能遏绝，寇贼奸宄不能殄灭，不畏天威，不用诏命，貌很自臧，持必不移，怀执异心，非沮军议。
王莽大怒，便下策书给严尤说：“你就职四年了，外族扰乱中原不能够镇压下去，盗贼奸邪不能够消灭，不畏惧上天的威严，不服从皇帝的命令，相貌狠毒，还自认为善良，固执己见，不可改变，怀抱贰心，破坏军事计划。
[Wang] Mang became furious and [wrote] a dismissal notice for [Chuang] Yu, which said, "You have overseen affairs to the fourth year, [but when] `the barbarians became troublesome to the Chinese,' you have not been able to stop or destroy them; when `robbers and brigands have caused disorder outside and inside [the government],' you have not been able to extirpate them; you have not been awed by the majestic [mandate] of Heaven and have not carried out my mandates in imperial edicts. Your visage has been harsh, [yet] you have approved of yourself. You insist that what you think is right and never change. In your bosom you have cherished inclinations toward rebellion, so that you have condemned and ruined [my plans] in the deliberations on military [matters]."

未忍致于理，其上大司马武建伯印韨，归故郡。”
我不忍心交给法司处理，应当缴上大司马武建伯的印信，回到原籍去。”
I cannot bear to apply the law to you. You shall deliver up your seals and aprons of the Commander-in-chief and of the Earl Establishing Military Power and return to your former commandery."

以降符伯董忠为大司马。
任命降符伯董忠作大司马。
[Let] the Earl Making Portents Descend, Tung Chung, become the Commander-in-chief."

翼平连率田况奏郡县訾民不实，莽复三十税一。
翼平郡连率田况报告郡里县里估量人民财产不真实，王莽又按三十分之一征收。
T'ien K'uang, the Leader of a Combination at Yi-p'ing [Commandery], memorialized that the commanderies and counties had not appraised the common people's [property] according to the facts, so [Wang] Mang again taxed [their property at the rate of] one-thirtieth.

以况忠言忧国，进爵为伯，赐钱二百万。
认为田况说话忠诚，关心国家，把他的爵位提升为伯爵，赏赐钱二百万。
Because of [T'ien] K'uang's faithful words and his solicitude for the state, he was advanced in noble rank, made an earl, and granted two million cash.

众庶皆詈之。
广大民众都咒骂他。
The mass of commoners all reviled him.

青、徐民多弃乡里流亡，老弱死道路，壮者入贼中。
青州和徐州的人民很多都抛弃家园流亡，老的弱的死在路上，强壮的加入了盗贼的队伍。
In Ch'ing and Hsü [Provinces], many of the common people left their native villages and became vagrants. The aged and weak died on the roads, and the vigorous entered the robber [bands].

夙夜连率韩博上言：“有奇士，长丈，大十围，来至臣府，曰欲奋击胡虏。
夙夜郡连率韩博上报说：“有个奇人，身高一丈，体大十围，来到我的公府，说想要奋力去攻打匈奴。
The Leader of a Combination at Su-yeh [Commandery], Han Po, sent a message to the emperor, saying, "There is a marvellous gentleman, ten feet tall and ten spans [in circumference], who came to your subject's yamen and said, `I am desirous with all my energy to attack the caitiff northern foreigners (Hu).' "

自谓巨毋霸，出于蓬莱东南，五城西北昭如海濒，轺车不能载，三马不能胜。
自己说名叫巨毋霸，生长在蓬莱东南，五城西北的昭如海边，轻便车装不下，三匹马拖不起。
He calls himself Chü-wu Pa and comes from the shore of the Chao-ju Sea northwest of the five cities southeast of P'eng-lai. A small chariot is not able to bear him, and three horses are not able to transport him.

即日以大车四马，建虎旗，载霸诣阙。
立刻用大车套四马，坚立虎旗，装载巨毋霸前来京城。
so, on the same day, in a large quadriga with four horses, on which is erected a tiger flag, bearing [Chü-wu] Pa, [I have sent him] to go to the [palace] Portal."

霸卧则枕鼓，以铁箸食，此皇天所以辅新室也。
巨毋霸睡觉头枕鼓，用铁筷子吃饭，这是上天要他来辅佐新朝的。
When [Chü-wu] Pa lies down, he pillows [his head] upon a drum. He eats with iron chopsticks. This [man has been sent] by August Heaven as a means of assisting the House of Hsin."

愿陛下作大甲高车，贲、育之衣，遣大将一人与虎贲百人迎之于道。
希望您制造一辆大甲高车，一套孟贲、夏育穿的衣服，派遣大将一人和勇士一百人到路上来迎接他。
I wish that your Majesty would have a large cuirass made, with a high chariot and garments for a [Meng] Pen or a [Hsia] Yü, and send a generalissimo and a hundred of the [Gentlemen] As Rapid As Tigers to meet him on the road."

京师门户不容者，开高大之，以视百蛮，镇安天下。”
京城门户不能够容纳他的，把它们开高些、开大些，把他给各外族看看，可以镇慑、安定天下。”
The gates and doors in the imperial capital which will not admit him should be enlarged and made taller and larger, in order to show him to the barbarians and settle down the world."

博意欲以风莽。
韩博的意思想要用来讥讽王莽。
[Han] Po's intention was that he wanted thereby to offer a hint to [Wang] Mang.

莽闻恶之，留霸在所新丰，更其姓曰巨母氏，谓因文母太后而霸王符也。
王莽听到了，怨恨韩博，让巨毋霸留在他所在的新丰县，更改他的姓叫巨母氏，意思是说多亏文母太后降生这个人，这是使自己成为霸王的符命。
[but when Wang] Mang was informed of it, he disliked it and detained [Chü-wu] Pa at the place where he was in Hsin-feng. He changed his surname to be Mr. Chü-mu (Chü's Mother), saying, "Because of the Empress Dowager the Mother of Culture there has been this portent [that Wang (Mang) Chü-(chün) should be] a lord protector (pa) and a [true] king."

征博下狱，以非所宜言，弃市。
把韩博关进监狱，认为那些话不是他所应当说的，处死。
[Wang Mang] summoned [Han] Po [to court], sent him to prison, and had him publicly executed, because he had said things that were not proper.

明年改元曰：地皇”，从三万六千岁历号也。
第二年改年号叫作地皇，是依照三万六千年历法大纲上的年号。
In the next year, the year-period was to be changed to Ti-huang, which was a title taken from the calendar for thirty-six thousand years.

地皇元年正月乙未，赦天下。
地皇元年正月乙末日，宣布大赦全国。
In [the period] Ti-huang, the first year, in the first month, on [the day] yi-wei, an amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

下书曰：“方出军行师，敢有趋讠襄犯法者，辄论斩，毋须时，尽岁止。”
下文告说：“正当出兵行军的时候，敢有奔跑吵闹触犯法律的，就杀头，不要等到行刑季节，这道命令实行到年底为止。”
[Wang] Mang issued a message, saying, "At the time when the army is being sent out and the troops are being put into motion, those who presume to run and shout, violating the law, should immediately be judged and beheaded. It is not necessary [to wait for] the season [for executions, winter]. When the year is up, [this order] shall cease."

于是春夏斩人都市，百姓震惧，道路以目。
于是春季夏季都在都市里杀人，百姓恐怖，路上相见，只有以目示意，不敢交谈。
Thereupon during the spring and summer people were beheaded in the market-places of the capitals; the people were terrified and afraid and `on the highroads and paths, they indicated their hatred [of Wang Mang] in their eyes.'

二月壬申，日正黑。
二月壬申日，太阳当顶时天色黑暗。
In the third month, on [the day] jen-shen, in the center of the sun there was a blackness.

莽恶之，下书曰：“乃者日中见昧，阴薄阳，黑气为变，百姓莫不惊怪。
王莽讨厌这种现象，下文告说：“前些时候日中出现昏暗，阴气侵犯阳气，黑气形成灾异，百姓没有谁不惊怪。
[Wang] Mang disliked it, and issued a message which said, "Recently, `in the sun an obscurity has appeared.' The Yin [principle] is pressing upon the Yang [principle, and has produced] the grievous vicissitude of a black emanation. None of the people have failed to be startled by the marvel."

兆域大将军王匡遣吏考问上变事者，欲蔽上之明，是以適见于天，以正于理，塞大异焉。”
兆域大将军王匡派遣属员去追究上报非常事故的人，想要遮蔽皇帝的耳目，因此从上天发出了谴责，应当让他受到法律制裁，来补救这样的大灾异。
The Generalissimo of the Northern City-wall [of Ch'ang-an], Wang K'uang, has sent an official to examine and question those who have presented [to the ruler] matters [concerning] grievous vicissitudes, [to examine] whether they intend to blind the throne's intelligence. For this reason, a reprobation has appeared in Heaven, in order that I might correct [matters by right] principles, and stop these great prodigies."

莽见四方盗贼多，复欲厌之，又下书曰：“予之皇初祖考黄帝定天下，将兵为上将军，建华盖，立斗献，内设大将，外置大司马五人，大将军二十五人，偏将军百二十五人，裨将军千二百五十人，校尉万二千五百人，司马三万七千五百人，候十一万二千五百人，当百二十二万五千人，士吏四十五万人，士千三百五十万人，应协于《易》‘孤矢之利，以威天下’。
王莽看到四方盗贼很多，想再要威慑他们，又下文告说：“我的伟大的皇初祖考黄帝平定天下，自己统率军队担任上将军，竖起华丽的车盖，立起北斗形的礼器，大本营设置大将，营外军设置大司马五人，大将军二十五人，偏将军一百二十五人，裨将军一千二百五十人，校尉一万二千五百人，司马三万七千五百人，军候十一万二千五百人，百长二十二万五千人，士宫四十五万人，战士一千三百五十万人，应合《易经》所说的‘弓箭锐利，用来威慑天下’。
When [Wang] Mang saw that the thieves and robbers in the four quarters were many, he again wanted to repress them, and so again sent out a message, saying, "When my August Deceased Original Ancestor, the Yellow Lord, tranquillized the world, he led his troops as a First [Ranking] General and established the flowery baldachin and set up the Bushel Bowl [Standard]. Within [the imperial court] I establish a General-in-[chief]; outside [the court I also] establish five Commanders-in-chief, 25 Generalissimos, 125 Lieutenant Generals, 1250 Major Generals, 12,500 Colonels, 37,500 Majors, 112,500 Captains, 225,000 Centurions, 450,000 Petty Officers, and 13,500,000 soldiers, in order to respond to and accord with [the saying in] the Book of Changes, `[This gave] the benefit of bows and arrows, whereby they might [awe] the world by their majesty.'

予受符命之文，稽前人，将条备焉。”
我接受符命的文辞，取法古人，打算逐步设置起来。”
I have obtained the writings of the mandate [of Heaven given through] portents and have examined [my enactments by the deeds] of earlier persons, since I desire that [my enactments] may be complete in detail."

于是置前后左右中大司马之位，赐诸州牧号为大将军，郡卒正、连帅、大尹为偏将军，属令长裨将军，县宰为校尉。
于是设置前大司马、后大司马、左大司马、右大司马、中大司马的职位，授予各州牧军衔为大将军，各郡卒正、连帅、大尹军衔为偏将军，属令、属长军衔为裨将军，各县长军衔为校尉。
Thereupon there were established the positions of Commander-in-chief at the Van, at the Rear, at the Left, at the Right, and at the Center. [Wang] Mang granted to the various Provincial Shepherds the title of Generalissimo; Directors of Confederations, Leaders of Combinations, and Grand Governors of commanderies became Lieutenant Generals; Prefects and Chiefs of Associations [became] Major Generals; and Rulers of counties became Colonels.

乘传使者经历郡国，日且十辈，仓无见谷以给，传车马不能足，赋取道中车马，取办于民。
乘坐传车的使者经过各郡国，每天将近十批，仓库里没有现存的粮食供给，驾传车的马匹不能够满足，就征用路上的车马，取给于民间。
Almost ten [groups of] commissioners in riding quadrigae daily passed through the commanderies and kingdoms. The granaries had no grain ready for supplying [their needs] and the chariots and horses in the post-stations could not be sufficient [for these many messengers, so the officials] levied and seized chariots and horses on the roads and requisitioned supplies from the common people.

七月，大风毁王路堂。
七月间，大风损毁了王路堂。
In the seventh month, a great wind damaged the Hall With the Royal Apartments.

复下书曰：“乃壬午餔时，有列风雷雨发屋折木之变，予甚弁焉，予甚栗焉，予甚恐焉。
又下文告道：“前向壬午日申时，发生了暴风大雷雨发掘房屋、摧折树木的变故，我对此非常惊疑，我对此非常战栗，我对此非常恐惧。
[so Wang Mang] again issued a message, saying, "Recently, on [the day] jen-wu, at the time for eating the afternoon meal, there was the grievous vicissitude of a strong wind, with thunder and rain, which unroofed houses and broke down trees. I was greatly excited. I was inspired with great fear. I was greatly terrified."

伏念一旬，迷乃解矣。
俯伏考虑十天，迷惑才解除了。
I humbly reflected and after ten days the riddle was then solved."

昔符命文立安为新迁王，临国雒阳，为统义阳王。
从前符命文辞说要立王安为新迁王，让王临在洛阳建国，作统义阳王。
"Previously, the words of a mandate [granted by] portents [said, `Wang] An should be set up as the Hsin-hsien King [(the King, the Immortal of the Hsin House); Wang] Lin should have Lo-yang as his state and should be the T'ung-yi-yang King [the King Controlling-the-line in which Right-principles Shine]."

是时予在摄假，谦不敢当，而以为公。
造时我在代行皇帝职权，谦辞不敢接受，让他们接受了公爵。
At that time, I was occupying [the post of] Regent and Acting [Emperor], so deferred and did not presume to [accept these titles], but made [my sons] Dukes."

其后金匮文至，议老皆曰：‘临国雒阳为统，谓据土中为新室统也，宜为皇太子。’
那以后金匮文辞来到了，舆论都说：‘王临在洛阳建国作统义阳王，是说他据有全国的中心作新朝的继承者，应当作皇太子。’
After that, there arrived the writing in the golden coffer. Those who discussed [these matters] all said, `[Wang] Lin's state should be Lo-yang; to be t'ung means to occupy the center of the Earth, to be [the continuer of] the dynastic line (t'ung) of the Hsin [House, (i.e., T'ung-yi-yang means to live in the center of the Earth and continue the dynastic line by which the right principles of the Hsin House shine)]. It is proper that he should be the Imperial Heir-apparent.'"

自此后，临久病，虽瘳不平，朝见挈茵舆行。
从此以后，王临久病，后来虽然痊愈，但没有完全康复，朝见时需要坐在毯子上面，由别人举着毯子放在车厢里推着行进。
"After this [time, Wang] Lin was ill for a long time, and, although he recovered, he was not entirely well, so that when he appeared at court, he traveled borne suspended on a mattress."

见王路堂者，张于西厢及后阁更衣中，又以皇后被疾，临且去本就舍，妃妾在东永巷。
在王路堂朝见时，要在西厢房和后合更衣室中陈设帷帐休息，又因为皇后得病，王临暂时离开原来的住处来到这里居处，他的妃妾住在东永巷。
When he came to an audience in the Hall With the Royal Apartments, he set up his bed in the Western Lateral Apartments together with the Central [Room] for Changing Garments in the Rear Pavilion. Because moreover the Empress was ill, [Wang] Lin temporarily left his original [rooms] and went to her dwelling. His Crown Princess and concubines were in the Eastern Long Lane."

壬午，烈风毁王路西厢及后阁更衣中室。
壬午曰，暴风损毁王路西厢房和后阁更衣中室。
"[On the day] jen-wu, a strong wind did violence to the Western Lateral Apartments of [the Hall] With the Royal Apartments and the Central Room for Changing Garments in the Rear Pavilion;"

昭宁堂池东南榆树大十围，东僵，击东阁，阁即东永巷之西垣也。
昭宁堂池东南有一棵粗十围的榆树，向东边倒下，撞击束合，东阁就是束永巷的西边围墙。
an elm tree, ten spans [or fathoms] in circumference, southeast of the pool at the Hall of Brilliant Peace, fell eastwards, striking the Eastern Pavilion. This Pavilion is the western wall of the Eastern Long Lane."

皆破折瓦坏，发屋拔木，予甚惊焉。
这些地方都破碎折断，屋瓦毁坏，发掘房屋，拔出树木，我对此非常惊骇。
All [these places] were destroyed. Tiles were broken, the roofs were taken off, and trees were uprooted. I was very much frightened."

又侯官奏月犯心前星，厥有占，予甚忧之。
又天文官报告说月球侵犯心宿前星，这有预兆，我很担心这件事。
"The Office for Watching [the Heavens] moreover memorialized that the Moon has invaded the front stars of [the constellation] Hsin, which has an interpretation. I was very much worried by it."

优念《紫阁图》文，太一、黄帝皆得瑞以仙，后世褒主当登终南山。
俯伏考虑《紫阁图》文辞，太一和黄帝都获得祥瑞而成仙，后代伟大的君主会登上终南山。
"I humbly considered the writing in the Tzu-ko-t'u, `The Supreme One and the Yellow Lord both obtained auspicious presages and thereby became immortals, and among their later generations a magnificent lord [Wang Mang] is due to ascend the Chung-nan [lit., he comes to his end to the south] Mountains.'"

所谓新迁王者，乃太一新迁之后也。
所谓新迁王，就是太一新迁的后继者。
What is meant by the Hsin-hsien King is that he is a descendant of the Supreme One and of the Immortal of the Hsin [House] (Hsin-hsien)."

统义阳王乃用五统以礼义登阳上千之后也。
统义阳王就是推行五伦凭藉礼义登上皇位从而上升仙境的后继者。
[What is meant by] the T'ung-yi-yang King is that he is a descendant of [the one] who uses the five dynastic principles (t'ung) and by means of the rules of proper conduct (li) and moral principles (yi) mounts up to the sunny side (yang [the south]) and becomes an immortal."

临有兄而称太子，名不正。
王临有哥哥而称为太子，名分不正。
"[Wang] Lin has an elder brother, but is called the Heir-apparent, so that his title is not correct."

宣尼公曰：‘名不正，则言不顺，至于刑罚不中，民无错手足。’
宣尼公说：‘名分不正，讲起话来就不顺当、不合理，以致执行刑罚不正确、不恰当，老百姓就不知道怎么办才好。’
Duke Hsüan-ni [As Recompense for Perfection (of Pao-ch'eng), Confucius,] said, `If titles are not correct, then speech will not be in accordance with [reality,' and so on], even to `punishments will not be appropriate' and `the common people will not know how to move their hands or feet.'"

惟即位以来，阴阳未和，风雨不时，数遇枯旱蝗螟为灾，谷稼鲜耗，百姓苦饥，蛮夷猾夏，寇贼奸宄，人民正营，无所错手足。
想我登上皇位以来，阴阳没有调和，风雨不适时，屡次遭到大旱和蝗虫螟虫造成灾害，粮食缺少，百姓被饥荒所苦，外族扰乱中原，盗贼奸邪捣乱，以致人民惶恐不安，不知道怎么办。
"Verily, since I have ascended the throne, the Yin and Yang [principles] have not been harmonious, so that the wind and rain have not been timely, and [the country] has several times met withering drought, locusts and caterpillars, which became [calamitous] visitations. The harvests of grain have been sparse or lacking, so that the people have suffered from famine. `The barbarians have troubled the Chinese and robbers and brigands have caused disorder outside and inside [the government,' so that] the common people are fearful and disturbed and `do not know how to move a hand or foot.'"

深惟厥咎，在名不正焉。

[Wang] Mang moreover saw that the thieves and robbers in the four quarters were many and wanted to make it appear that he himself was tranquil and was able to be the founder [of a dynasty enduring for] ten thousand generations, so issued a message which said, 

“予受命遭阳九之厄，百六之会，府帑空虚，百姓匮乏，宗庙未修，且袷祭于明堂太庙，夙夜永念，非敢宁息。

Ts'ui Fa and Chang Han spoke to [Wang] Mang, saying, "For those upon whom the virtue [of Heaven is bestowed] abundantly the ritual practises are elaborate. It would be proper to make the arrangements [of these temples] magnificent and to make [that fact] plainly known [to all] within [the four] seas, so as to bring it about that [even] after ten thousand generations, nothing in them should be changed around or despised."

From the time that [Wang] Mang acted out of accord with the ordinances for the seasons, the people hated him, [yet Wang] Mang [acted] as if he was undisturbed by that [hatred. So] he again issued a message, saying, "Verily, ever since these temporary laws have been established, in the capital, Ch'ang-an, with its six districts and great city, the warning drums have rarely sounded and robbers and bandits have decreased and become few.

[Wang Mang] had the Palace Attendant, the General of Agile Cavalry and the Marquis of Like Delight, [Wang] Lin, grant the ghost garments and the Kingly seal and apron [for the deceased]. [Wang Mang's] funeral eulogy [for Wang Lin] said, "[According to] the writing in the mandate [of Heaven given through] portents, [Wang] Lin should have been set up as the T'ung-yi-yang King. This [phrase] means that 36,000 years after the House of Hsin had taken the throne, one who is a descendant of [Wang] Lin is then due to rise up as the dragon sun."

当初，王莽为列侯去封国的时候，宠爱侍者增秩、怀能和开明。
Previously, [when Wang] Mang had been [a mere] marquis and had gone to his state, he had favored [some] attendants, Tseng-chih, Huai-neng, and K'ai-ming.

怀能生男兴，增秩生男匡、女晔，开明生女捷，皆留新都国，以其不明故也。
怀能生下了儿子王兴，增秩生下了儿子王匡和女儿王晔，开明生下了女儿王捷，都留在新都国，因为他们的身份不明的缘故。
Huai-neng had given birth to a boy, [Wang] Hsing; Ts'eng-chih had given birth to a boy, [Wang] K'uang, and a girl, [Wang] Yeh; and K'ai-ming had given birth to a girl, [Wang] Chieh. All had been detained at [Wang Mang's] state at Hsin-tu, for the reason that he did not want to make it known [that he had had relations with any women besides his wife].

及安疾甚，莽自病无子，为安作奏，使上言：“兴等母虽微贱，属犹皇子，不可以弃。”
等到王安病得厉害了，王莽自己担心没有儿子，替王安写了一道奏章，让他上奏道：“王兴等人的母亲虽然出身微贱，亲属关系仍然是皇子，不可以抛弃。”
When moreover [Wang] An had become seriously ill, [Wang] Mang was himself pained that he would have no sons [remaining, so] he wrote a memorial for [Wang] An and had him send it to the throne. It said, "Although the mothers of [Wang] Hsing and the others are humble in status, yet in their relationship [to you, my father, these young people] are still your Imperial Sons and Daughters, and so should not be discarded."

章视群公，皆曰：“安友于兄弟，宜及春夏加封爵。”
王莽把奏章交给各大臣传阅，都说：“王安友爱兄弟，应当趁着春夏两季加给封爵。”
The document was shown to the various highest ministers and they all said that [Wang] An was "fraternally loving to his [half]-brothers and sisters," so that it would be proper, when the spring or summer arrived, to give them enfeoffments and noble titles.

于是以王车遣使者迎兴等，封兴为功脩任，匡为功建公，晔为睦脩任，捷为睦逮任。
于是派遣使者用王车前去迎接王兴等人，赐封王兴为功脩公，王匡为功建公，王晔为睦脩任，王捷为睦逮任。
Thereupon kingly chariots were sent with commissioners to go and bring [Wang] Hsing and the others [to the court. Wang] Hsing was enfeoffed as the Duke of Cultivated Merits, [Wang] K'uang as Duke of Established Merits, [Wang] Yeh as Baroness of Cultivated Concord, and [Wang] Chieh as Baroness of Attained Concord.

然颇采其言，左迁鲁匡为五原卒正，以百姓怨非故。

初，四方皆以饥寒穷愁起为盗贼，稍稍群聚，常思岁熟得归乡里。
起初，各地人民都由于饥寒贫苦才铤而走险去作盗贼，逐渐聚集成为群体，时常盼望着年成丰收了能够返回家园。
Previously, because the four quarters [of the country] had all [suffered from] famine and cold, [the people] were impoverished and troubled, and so had arisen and become thieves and robbers, until gradually crowds gathered. They constantly thought that if the harvest would be good, they would be able to return to their native villages.

They did not presume to take or to possess cities or towns and went about foraging and seeking for merely what food they would use up daily.

诸长吏牧守皆自乱斗中兵而死，贼非敢欲杀之也，而莽终不谕其故。
各县长官和州牧、郡太守都是自己乱碰乱撞被杀伤而死的，盗贼并不是存心想要杀死他们，可是王莽一直不懂得这个道理。
When various Chief Officials, Shepherds and Administrators all themselves fought with them in a disorderly manner, were wounded by weapons, and died, it was not because the bandits presumed to intend to kill them. But [Wang] Mang to the end did not understand the purposes of these [bandits].

是岁，大司马士按章豫州，为贼所获，贼送付县。
这一年，有个大司马士到豫州办案，被盗贼俘虏了，盗贼把他送交县里。
In this year, an Officer of the Commander-in-chief was in Yü Province, examining [into what had been reported in] a document, and was captured by the bandits, [whereupon] the bandits escorted and sent him to the county-seat.

[Wang] Mang became greatly incensed, and sent him to prison because he considered [that the man] was falsifying [the situation] to deceive [his superiors].

因下书责七公曰：“夫吏者，理也。
于是下文告责备四辅三公道：“吏的意思就是管理、治理人民。
Thereupon he issued a message reproving the seven highest ministers, which said, "Verily, to be an official [means] to bring about order."

宣扬德政，彰明恩泽，去管教抚育人民，这是善良政治的原则。

今则不然。
现在就不是这个样子。
"Now however [the situation] has been otherwise."

盗发不辄得，至成群党，遮略乘传宰士。
盗贼发生了，不能够逮捕法办，直到结成群体，拦劫乘坐传车的朝廷官吏。
When thieves appeared, they were not immediately apprehended, so they were able to form cliques and intercept and kidnap Ruling Officers from [government] riding quadrigae."

士得脱者，又妄自言：我责数贼：‘何故为是？’
官脱了身的，又妄自说‘我列举罪状谴责盗贼“为什么干这种事”，
An Officer who succeeded in getting free from them moreover himself said senselessly, `I questioned and reprimanded the robbers, [saying], "Why do you do this [robbing]?"

贼曰：‘以贫穷故耳。’
盗贼说“就因为贫穷的缘故罢了”。
and the robbers replied, "Merely because we are impoverished and in need."

贼护出我。
盗贼送我出来。
[Then] the robbers protected and sent me away.'

今俗人议者率多若此。
现在一些糊涂人谈论的通常多是这样。
At present, vulgar people who discuss [banditry say that the bandits] for the most part are like these [ones]."

惟贫困饥寒，犯法为非，大者群盗，小者偷穴，不过二科，
想想看，由于贫困饥寒，犯法为非作歹，大的群体去抢劫，小的一个人去偷窃，不过这样两种方式，
"I reflect [that, when people], out of distress from famine or cold violate the laws and do evil, the greater ones become groups of thieves and the lesser ones steal [by making] holes [in people's walls]. There are no more than these two kinds."

今乃结谋连常以千百数，是逆乱之大者，岂饥寒之谓邪？
现在竟然有计划有组织以千百计，这是叛乱的罪魁祸首，难道是饥寒可以解释得了的吗？
But now they have conspired together and joined to form gangs of thousands and hundreds. This is the greatest disobedience and rebellion; how could it be spoken of as [due to] famine or cold?"

七公其严敕卿大夫、卒正、连率、庶尹，谨牧养善民，急捕殄盗贼。
七公应当严肃告诫卿大夫、卒正、连率和各大尹，认真管教抚养善良人民，迅速捉拿歼灭盗贼。
"Let the seven highest ministers strictly order the High Ministers, Grandees, Directors of Confederations, Leaders of Combinations, and `the heads of offices' carefully to shepherd the good common people and hurriedly arrest and exterminate the thieves and robbers."

有不同心并力，疾恶黜贼，而妄曰饥寒所为，辄捕系，请其罪。”
如有不同心合力，憎恨邪恶行为，谴责盗贼，而胡说他们是由于饥寒所迫才这样干的，就逮捕监禁，查办他们的罪行。”
If there are any who do not, with one mind and with mutual assistance, hate and drive out the bandits, and, if they say unreasonably that [the bandits] have been caused by hunger or cold, they shall immediately be arrested and held in prison, and [the officials] shall beg [me to pass sentence upon] their crime."

于是群下愈恐，莫敢言贼情者，亦不得擅发兵，贼由是遂不制。
于是官吏们更加惶恐，没有谁敢说盗贼的真实情况，又不准擅自调动军队，盗贼因此终于无法制服。
Thereupon the numerous subordinates [of the ruler] feared all the more and none presumed to speak of the bandits' circumstances. They also were not permitted to mobilize troops unauthorizedly. Because of this, the bandits were not restrained.

唯翼平连率田况素果敢，发民年十八以上四万余人，授以库兵，与刻石为约。
只有翼平郡连率田况一向果断勇敢，他发动年龄在十八岁以上的民众四万多人，发给他们库存的武器，把军事法令刻在石上向他们宣布。
Only the Leader of a Combination at Yi-p'ing [Commandery], T'ien K'uang, had for some time past dared to mobilize the common people who were in their eighteenth year and above, [to the number of] more than forty thousand persons, had furnished them arms from the arsenals, and had given them engraved stones as [signs of their] convenant.

赤糜闻之，不敢入界。
赤眉军听到了，不敢进入郡界。
The Red Eyebrows had heard of it and had not presumed to enter his borders.

况自劾奏，莽让况：“未赐虑符而擅发兵，此弄兵也。
田况自动弹劾检举自己，王莽责备田况：“没有发给虎符而擅自调集军队，这是擅动干戈犯上作乱，
[T'ien] K'uang impeached himself in a memorial, and [Wang] Mang reprimanded [T'ien] K'uang: "You have not been granted a tiger credential, yet have unauthorizedly mobilized troops. This is playing with weapons."

厥罪乏兴。
这种罪名应当跟贻误军机同样处理。
This crime is that of negligence in raising [troops]."

以况自诡必禽灭贼，故且勿治。”
因为你自己保证一定捉拿消灭盗贼，所以姑且不予处分。”
Because you, K'uang, have reproved yourself [and have said that you would] certainly capture and destroy the robbers, you are [however] temporarily not to be punished."

后况自请出界击贼，所向皆破。
后来田况自动请求越过郡界攻打盗贼，他的军队所指向的盗贼都被打败了。
Later [T'ien] K'uang himself begged to go out of the boundaries [of his commandery] and attack the robbers, [saying that] those against whom he turned would all be routed.

莽以玺书令况领青、徐二州牧事。
王莽用加盖了御玺的诏书命令田况代理青州和徐州两州牧的职务。
[Wang] Mang used a message [stamped] with the imperial seal to order [T'ien] K'uang to be put in charge of the affairs of the Shepherds in the two provinces of Ch'ing and Hsü.

况上言：“盗贼始发，其原甚微，非部吏、伍人所能禽也。
田况上报告说：“盗贼刚发生，他们的基础很薄弱，但不是地方治安官吏和邻里后备兵所能捉拿得了的。
[T'ien] K'uang [memorialized] the throne, saying, "Although when thieves and robbers first start out, in the beginning they are very unimportant, yet they cannot be captured by the divisional officers and [the organization of] people in groups of five."

咎在长吏不为意，县欺其郡，郡欺朝廷，实百言十，实千言百。
责任在于县级主要官吏不在意，县里欺骗郡里，郡里欺骗朝廷，实际上有一百人，祇说十人，实际上有一千人，祇说一百人。
The fault lies [in the fact that] the Chief Officials [of counties] do not give it a thought. The counties deceive the commanderies, and the commanderies deceive the [imperial] court. When in reality there are a hundred [robbers], they say ten; and when in reality there are a thousand, they say a hundred."

朝廷忽略，不辄督责，遂至延曼连州，乃遣将率，多发使者，传相监趣。
朝廷忽略，不立即进行督察，给予责罚，终于发展到蔓延几州，才派遣将帅，多派出使者，辗转督促。
Then the court is negligent and does not immediately supervise and punish [the bandits], so that they even spread over adjoining provinces. When moreover generals and lieutenants are sent, and many commissioners are sent out continuously to supervise and urge each other on."

郡县力事上官，应寒诘对，共酒食，具资用，以救断斩，不给复忧盗贼治官事。
郡里县里尽力服事上级长官，应付责问检查，供给酒饭，准备物资和费用，来解救自己的死罪，没有工夫再去考虑盗贼和办理公事。
[the officials of] the commanderies and counties serve their superior officials energetically, in answering and excusing themselves, in replying to questions, in offering wine and food, and in furnishing necessaries, in order to save themselves from being sentenced and beheaded, and so do not have [the time] again to think of the thieves or robbers or to perform their official business."

将率又不能躬率吏士，战则为贼所破，吏气浸伤，徒费百姓。
将帅又不能亲自率领军官和士兵去冲锋陷阵，一交战就被盗贼打败，士气逐渐削弱，徒然耗费了老百姓的钱粮。
The generals and lieutenants moreover are not able in person to lead their officers and soldiers, and so, when a battle [is fought, their troops] are routed by the bandits, their officers gradually [become] dispirited, and [the expedition] is merely an expense upon the people."

前幸蒙赦令，贼欲解散，或反遮击，恐入山谷转相告语，故郡县降贼，皆更惊骇，恐见诈灭，因饥馑易动，旬日之间更十余万人，此盗贼所以多之故也。
前次幸而得到了赦免的命令，盗贼想要解散，有人反而加以截击，他们惶恐地退入山谷，辗转传告原先各郡县已经投降的盗贼，都更加惊骇，恐怕被欺骗以致被消灭，因为饥荒时期人心容易动摇，十来天的时间又是十多万人，造就是盗贼所以众多的缘故。
"When previously [the bandits] fortunately received an order of amnesty and the bandits wanted to disband and scatter, some [of them] on the contrary were prevented [from returning home] and were attacked, so from fear they entered the mountains and valleys, and in turn told the others [about it]. Hence the bandits in the commanderies and counties who had surrendered all changed [their attitudes] and became terrified, fearing that they would be destroyed by trickery. Because of the famine, they were easily moved, and within ten days there were again more than a hundred thousand men [in the bandit troops]. The foregoing is the reason that the thieves and robbers are so numerous."

今雒阳以东，米石二千。
现在洛阳以东地区，米价每石值两千钱。
"At present, east of Lo-yang, grain is two thousand [cash per] picul."

窃见诏书，欲遣太师、更始将军，二人爪牙重臣，多从人众，道上空竭，少则亡以威视远方。
我看到诏书，说想要派遣太师和更始将军前来，他们两人是权威的大臣，一定要多带人员，而沿途民穷财尽，无法供给，如果随从人员太少，就无法用来威震远方。
Your humble servant has seen a written imperial edict that it is intended to send the Grand Master, [Wang K'uang], and the General of a New Beginning, [Lien Tan, to attack the bandits]. They are important courtiers who are your military assistants. If their crowds of followers are multiplied, [these followers] will become exhausted [from lack of food] on the way; whereas if [their followers are] reduced [in number, these ministers] will have no way of overawing the distant quarters [of the empire]."

宜急选牧、尹以下，明其赏罚。
应当迅速选择州牧、大尹以下官吏，明确规定对他们的赏罚，
"It would be proper to select promptly Shepherds and Governors or those [ranking] below them, make plain the rewards and punishments that they [can deal out]."

收合离乡、小国无城郭者，徙其老弱置大城中，积藏谷食，并力固守。
让他们收集没有城堡的分散的乡聚和小封国，把它们的老弱居民迁移安顿到大城里，储积粮食，合力坚守。
and [have them] collect together those people from scattered villages and small states [of nobles] that have no city walls, transport their old and weak [persons], putting them inside the large cities, [then] collect and store foodstuffs and mutually assist in firmly guarding [these centers]."

贼来攻城，则不能下，所过无食，势不得群聚。
盗贼来攻城，就不能攻下，所经过的地方没有粮食，凭这样的发展趋势，他们就不可能大规模聚集。
"When the bandits come to attack the cities, they will then be unable to take them and [the places] by which they pass will have no food, so that their circumstances will not permit them to collect in bands."

如此，招之必降，击之则灭。
像这样，招抚他们就一定会投降，攻打他们就一定会被消灭。
Under such [a situation], when they are summoned, they will certainly surrender, and when they are attacked, they will be annihilated."

今空复多出将率，郡县苦之，反甚于贼。
如果徒然再多派出将帅，地方官民害怕他们，反而比害怕盗贼还厉害。
"If now generals and lieutenants are vainly sent out in numbers, the commanderies and counties will suffer from them more severely than from the bandits."

宜尽征还乘传诸使者，以休息郡县，委任臣况以二州盗贼，必平定之。”
应当全部调回乘坐传车的众多使者，让地方官民得到休养生息。您如果把平定两州盗贼的任务委托我田况，我一定平定他们。”
"It would be proper to summon back all the commissioners in riding quadrigae in order to give rest to the commanderies and counties, and entrust to your servant K'uang the thieves and robbers of [these] two provinces, for I will certainly tranquillize them."

莽畏恶况，阴为发代，遣使者赐况玺书。
王莽畏忌厌恶田况，悄悄派出了接替他的人，派遣使者赐给田况盖了御玺的诏书。
[Wang] Mang feared and dreaded [T'ien] K'uang, so secretly sent a substitute for him, and [also] sent a commissioner to grant [T'ien] K'uang a message with the imperial seal.

使者至，见况，因令代监其兵。
使者到达，会见了田况，便让接替的人监管他的部队。
When the commissioner arrived and had audience with [T'ien] K'uang, he thereupon ordered the substitute to superintend [T'ien K'uang's] troops.

况随使者西，到，拜为师尉大夫。
田况随同使者西行，到了长安，授任他作师尉大夫。
[T'ien] K'uang followed the commissioner westwards. When he reached [the court], he was installed as the Metropolis Commandant Grandee.

况去，齐地遂败。
田况走了以后，齐地的局势终于不可收拾了。
When [T'ien] K'uang had left, the region of [the former feudal state of] Ch'i was thereupon lost [to the bandits].

三年正月，九庙盖构成，纳神主。
三年正月，九所祠庙建筑竣工，安放了神主。
In the third year, the first month, the roofing of the Nine [Ancestral] Temples was completed and the spirit tablets were installed.

莽谒见，大驾乘六马，以五采毛为龙文衣，著角，长三尺。
王莽去拜见，车队按照最高规格组成，他的乘车套着六匹马，马披着用五彩羽毛织成龙形图案的套子，头上装着义角，有三尺长。
[When Wang] Mang [went] to be presented [to the divinities there, he rode] in the grand carriage of state, to which were yoked six horses, [on which] were robes with dragon stripes made of vari-colored feathers, to which were affixed three-foot long horns.

华盖车，元戎十乘有前。
华盖车和十辆大型战车走在前头。
The carriage with a flowery baldachin and "ten large war chariots" went before him.

因赐治庙者司徒、大司空饯客千万，侍中、中常侍以下皆封。
于是赏赐主持建庙工程的大司徒和大司空各一千万钱，侍中和中常侍以下人员都有封赏。
Thereupon he granted to the Minister Over the Masses, [Wang Hsün], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Yi], who had built the temples, to each ten million [cash]. The Palace Attendants, Regular Palace Attendants, and those of lower [rank] were all enfeoffed.

In the third month, there was a visitation [of fire] at the Pa [River] Bridge. Several thousand people sprinkled water to save it, [but the fire was] not [thereby] extinguished.

莽恶之，下书曰：“夫三皇象春，五帝象夏，三王象秋，五伯象冬。
王莽讨厌这件事，下文告说：“三皇象征春天，五帝象征夏天，三王象征秋天，五霸象征冬天。
[Wang] Mang hated it, so issued a message which said, "Verily, the three August Ones typify spring, the Five Lords typify summer, the three [dynasties of] Kings typify autumn, and the five Lords Protector typify winter."

皇王，德运也；伯者，继空续乏以成历数，故其道驳。
从三皇、五帝到三王，都是靠德行来决定国家统治权力的转移；五霸的出现，是由于这个时期没有权威的帝王来统治，只好由他们来填补时代的空缺，因而获得了天运，所以他们的治国原则是杂乱的。
The virtues of the August Ones and the Kings followed [one another] in a cycle. The Lords Protector [including the Ch'in dynasty] succeeded [to the rule of the world in] the vacancy and continued in the gap [between the periods ruled by the elements wood and fire] in order to complete the [full] number in a cycle; hence their ways were disorderly."

惟常安御道多以所近为名。
想起长安的大街多数根据所邻近的地方起名。

乃二月癸巳之夜，甲午之辰，火烧霸桥，从东方西行，至甲午夕，桥尽火灭。
前向二月癸巳日的深夜，到甲午日的早晨，火烧霸桥，从束端烧到西端，直到甲午日的傍晚，桥烧光了火才熄灭。
"Recently in the third month, in the night of [the day] kuei-szu and on the morning of [the day] chia-wu, fire burnt the Pa [River] Bridge from the eastern side going westwards. By the evening of [the day] chia-wu, the Bridge was completely destroyed by the fire."

大司空行视考问，或云寒民舍居桥下，疑以火自燎，为此灾也。
大司空巡视审问，有人说贫民在桥下留宿，可能是他们烤火取暖，造成了这场灾害。
"When the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Yi], went to inspect it, he examined and questioned [persons], and someone said that shivering people dwelt below the bridge, and he suspected that they warmed themselves by a fire, which became this visitation [of fire]."

其明旦即乙未，立春之日也。
第二天就是乙末日，是立春的日子。
"The next day was [the day] yi-wei, which was the day of the vernal equinox."

予以神明圣祖黄、虞遗统受命，至于地皇四年为十五年。

"[From the time that] I received the mandate [of Heaven] through the line of succession transmitted from the gods my sage ancestors, the Yellow [Lord] and Yü [Shun], down to the fourth year of [the period] Ti-huang, it will be the fifteenth year."

正以三年终冬绝灭霸驳之桥，欲以兴成新室统一长存之道也。
刚好在三年冬季的尽头彻底毁灭，反映了杂乱的霸道的霸桥，想要用来完成新朝统一长存的治国原则。
"Exactly at the end of winter in the third year [of the period Ti-huang], the bridge which is [named] Pa (`tyrannical' or `Lords Protector') and [therefore] disorderly has been broken and destroyed. [Heaven] thereby intends to prosper and perfect the way the House of Hsin is to be unified in control [of the country] and preserved for a long [time]."

又戒此桥空东方之道。
又用毁灭这座桥来警告我们，要开拓东方的道路。
"This is also a warning [from Heaven in that the breaking of] this bridge has placed a gap in the highway to the eastern quarter [of the empire]."

今东方岁荒民饥，道路不通，东岳太师亟科条，开东方诸仓，赈贷穷乏，以施仁道。
现在东方年岁灾荒，人民饥饿，道路不通，束岳太师迅速制定法令条规，开放东方各处粮仓，救济贫苦人民，实行仁慈的原则。
"Now in the eastern quarter the harvest has been lacking, the common people are starving, and the highways and roads are impassible [because of bandits. The Chief of] the Eastern Sacred Peak and Grand Master, [Wang K'uang], shall promptly [make] regulations for opening the various granaries in the eastern quarter and giving or lending to the distressed [people, in order] to apply the principle of benevolence."

其更名霸馆为长存馆，霸桥为长存桥。”
应当把霸馆改名为长存馆，把霸桥改名为长存桥。”
"Let the name of the Pa Lodge be changed to be the Ch'ang-ts'un (Long-preserved) Lodge, and let the Pa [River] Bridge become the Ch'ang-ts'un Bridge."

In the fourth month, [Wang Mang] sent the Grand Master, Wang K'uang, and the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, eastwards. When, outside the Capital Gate, they were sacrificing to the gods of the roads, Heaven [sent] a great rain which dampened their clothes, and the elders sighed and said, "This is because [Heaven] weeps for the army."

长老叹曰：“是为泣军！”
老年人叹息说：“这是为军队哭泣！”
the elders sighed and said, "This is because [Heaven] weeps for the army."

莽曰：“惟阳九之厄，与害气会，究于去年。
王莽说：“想起不幸的命运，跟灾害之气相会合，到去年终止了。
[Wang] Mang said, "Verily, the distresses of the nine dry years conjoined with disastrous emanations have come to a climax in the past years, when withering droughts, frosts, locusts, and famines came as previously, so that the people are miserably poor, and wander scattered along the roads."

枯旱霜蝗，饥馑荐臻，百姓困乏，流离道路，于春尤甚，予甚悼之。
大旱灾、霜灾、蝗灾不断发生，饥荒接连来到，百姓生活困难，到处流浪，在今年春天尤其厉害，我非常悲伤。

太师公所不经过的地方，分派大夫和谒者同时开放各处粮仓，以保全善良的老百姓。
"On those highways along which the Grand Master and Highest Minister does not pass, he shall separately send a Grandee or Internuncio to open the granaries simultaneously, in other to preserve the great multitude."

太师公因与廉丹大使五威司命位右大司马更始将军平均侯之兖州，填抚所掌，及青、徐故不轨盗贼未尽解散，后复屯聚者，皆清洁之，期于安兆黎矣。”
太师公随后同大使五威司命、位右大司马、更始将军平均侯廉丹前往兖州，镇抚所属官吏和人民，还有青州和徐州原来无法无天的盗贼没有完全解散或者后来又聚集起来的，都把他们消灭干净，以求安定亿万人民。”
"The Grand Master and Highest Minister, [Wang K'uang], shall thereupon, with the Chief Envoy and Director of Mandates from the Five Majestic [Principles], ranking as Commander-in-chief of the Right, the General of a New Beginning and Marquis of Equalization and Standards, Lien Tan, go to Yen Province, to pacify [the region] of which he, [the Grand Master], is in charge. Moreover those who formerly have been lawless and the bandits in Ch'ing and Hsü [Provinces] who have not yet completely dispersed or have later again assembled shall all be purified. I hope that thereby the myriad people may be pacified."

太师、更始合将锐士十余万人，所过放纵。
太师和更始将军一起统率精锐士兵十多万人，所经过的地方放任士兵，不加约束。
The Grand Master, [Wang K'uang, and the General] of a New Beginning, [Lien Tan], together led more than a hundred thousand ardent soldiers, and wherever they went they did as they liked.

东方为之语曰：“宁逢赤眉，不逢太师！太师尚可，更始杀我！”
东部地区人民为他们编成俗语说：“宁肯遇着赤眉军，不要遇着太师兵！太师兵抢劫还是小事，更始兵屠杀我们！”

莽又多遣大夫谒者分教民煮草木为酪，酪不可食，重为烦费。
王莽又派遣很多大夫和谒者分道教授人民把草木熬成胶，胶不能吃，反而增加人力物力的浪费。
[Wang] Mang also sent out many Grandees and Internuncios by divisions to teach the common people to boil grasses and [parts of] trees to make a vegetable juice, [but] the vegetable juice could not be eaten, and [the sending merely] made much trouble and expense.

莽下书曰：“惟民困乏，虽溥开诸仓以赈赡之，犹恐未足。
王莽下文告说：“想到人民生活困难，虽然普遍开放各处粮仓去救济他们，还恐怕不够。

至地皇三十年如故，是王光上戊之六年也。
到地皇三十年恢复原来的状态，那是王光上戊的六年了。
"In the thirtieth year [of the period] Ti-huang, [the restrictions shall be reapplied] as formerly. This [year] will be the sixth year of [the period] Wang-kuang-shang-mou."

如令豪吏猾民辜而攉之，小民弗蒙，非予意也。
如果让强梁的官吏和狡猾的豪民垄断了那些利益，普通人民得不到好处，那就不是我的用意了。
"If powerful and unruly officials or common people have committed crime and monopolized the [mountains and marshes, so that] the uninfluential common people have not received [any advantages], this has not been my intention."

《易》不云乎？‘损上益下，民说无疆。’
《易经》不是说过吗？‘削减贵族的利益，增加平民的利益，人民无比高兴。’

so [Wang] Mang sent the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles] and Generalissimo, K'ung Jen, [to be in charge of] the division, Yü Province, and the Communicator and Generalissimo, Chuang Yu, and the Arranger of the Ancestral Temples and Generalissimo, Ch'en Mou, to attack [the rebels] in Ching Province. Each one was followed by more than a hundred officers and soldiers. They rode in boats down the Wei [River] into the [Yellow] River to Hua-yin, then left [the boats and took] riding quadrigae. When they reached their divisions, they solicited soldiers.

尤谓茂曰：“遣将不与兵符，必先请而后动，是犹绁韩卢而责之获也。”
严尤对陈茂说：“派出将领不发给兵符，遇事一定要先请示然后才能行动，这就好像牵着猎犬而要求它去捉住野兽一样。”
[Chuang] Yu said to [Ch'en] Mou, "To send a general and not to give him the credentials [for levying] troops, so that he must first beg [the emperor] and then only can he make a move, is like tying up a Han black hunting-dog and yet demanding it to catch [game]."

先是，莽使中黄门王业领长安市买，贱取于民，民甚患之。

业以省费为功，赐爵附城。

赤眉军别部校尉董宪等人的部队几万人在梁郡活动，王匡想要进攻他们，廉丹认为新近攻下县城的士兵疲劳了，应当暂时让士兵休整一下恢复战斗力。
A detached Colonel of the Red Eyebrows, Tung Hsien, and others, with a band of several ten-thousand men, were in Liang Commandery. Wang K'uang wanted to advance and attack them, [but] Lien Tan considered that [their own troops] had but newly taken a city by storm, so were utterly weary, and their men ought temporarily to be rested, in order to increase their prestige.

匡不听，引兵独进，丹随之。
王匡不听从，单独带领军队前进，廉丹只好跟着他。

丹使吏持其印韨符节付匡曰：“小儿可以逃走，我不行！”
廉丹派军官拿着自己的印信和符节交给王匡，说道：“小儿可以逃走，我不行！”

莽伤之，下书曰：“惟公多拥选士精兵，众郡骏马仓谷帑藏皆得自调，忽于诏策，离其威节，骑马呵噪，为狂刃所害，乌呼哀哉！
王莽伤痛，下文告说：“想起您拥有很多经过挑选的精锐士兵，各郡的好马、仓储粮食、库存金钱都准许你自己调用，可是忽略了诏书里所说的战略战术，离开了自己的权威标志，骑着马大喊大叫，被乱刀所杀害，可悲呀！
[Wang] Mang was afflicted by it, so issued a written message which said, "Verily, you, Duke, [Lien Tan], controlled many select gentlemen and picked troops. From all the fine horses, the grain in the storehouses, and the stores in the treasuries of the many commanderies, you might have made your own selection, but you cared not for documentary imperial edicts and separated yourself from the majestic credentials [of power]. Mounting a horse you shouted and [your followers] yelled and were killed by wild swords. Alas! How sad!"

赐谥曰‘果公’。
赐给谥号叫作果公。
"I grant him the posthumous name of Duke Kuo (Intrepid)."

国将哀章谓莽曰：“皇祖考黄帝之时，中黄直为将，破杀蚩尤。
国将哀章对王莽说：“皇祖考黄帝的时候，中黄直作大将，打败并杀死了蚩尤。
The State General, Ai Chang, spoke to [Wang] Mang, saying, "In the time of your August Deceased Original Ancestor, the Yellow Lord, when Chung-huang Chih was his General, he routed and killed Ch'ih-yu."

今臣中黄直之位，愿平山东。”
现在我居于中黄直的职位，愿意去平定山东地区。”
"Now your servant is occupying the post of Chung-huang Chih, and wishes to tranquillize [the region] east of the mountains."

莽遣章驰东，与太师匡并力。
王莽派遣哀章赶往东方，跟太师王匡合力。
[Wang] Mang [accordingly] sent [Ai] Chang to gallop eastwards and join his forces with the Grand Master, [Wang] K'uang.

又遗大将军阳浚守敖仓，司徒王寻将十余万屯雒阳填南宫，大司马董忠养士习射中军北垒，大司空王邑兼三公之职。
又派遣大将军阳浚去防守敖仓，大司徒王寻统率十多万人驻扎洛阳，坐镇南宫，大司马董忠在中军北垒营地训练士兵练习武艺，大司空王邑兼理三公的职务。
He also sent Generalissimo Yang Chün to guard the Ao Granary. The Minister Over the Masses, Wang Hsün, leading more than a hundred thousand [men], encamped at Lo-yang, where he garrisoned the Southern Palace. The Commander-in-chief, Tung Chung, instructed soldiers and practiced archery in the Northern Encampment of the Capital Army. The Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi, [was given] concurrently the duties of [all] the three highest ministers.

司徒寻初发长安，宿霸昌厩，亡其黄钺。
大司徒王寻刚从长安出发，在霸昌厩过夜，丢失了他的黄金铁斧。
When the [Grand] Minister Over the Masses, [Wang] Hsün, first started out from Ch'ang-an and spent the night at the Pa-ch'ang Stables, he lost his yellow battle-axe.

寻士房扬素狂直，乃哭曰：“此经所谓‘丧其齐斧’者也！”
王寻的办事官员房扬一向放纵直率，便哭着说：“造就是经书上所说‘失掉了锐利的斧子’的意思啊！”
[Wang] Hsün's Officer, Fang Yang, was ordinarily impetuously outspoken, but he wept and said, "This is what the Classic means [when it says], `He has lost his sharp axe.' "

自劾去。
他自我弹劾离职了。
He accused himself [of the loss] and left [the army.

莽击杀扬。
王莽把房扬打死了。
Wang] Mang had [Fang] Yang killed with a battle-axe.

四方盗贼往往数万人攻城邑，杀二千石以下。
各处盗贼每每几万人进攻城邑，杀死二千石级以下的官吏。
The thieves and robbers in the four quarters, [whose bands] frequently [numbered] several ten-thousands of men, attacked cities and towns, killing [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs and under.

太师王匡等战数不利。
太师王匡等人交战多次不胜利。
The Grand Master, Wang K'uang, and others fought several battles, but unsuccessfully.

莽知天下溃畔，事穷计迫，乃议遣风俗大夫司国宪等分行天下，除井田奴婢山泽六管之禁，即位以来诏令不便于民者皆收还之。
王莽知道全国民心分离背叛，事势已经到了尽头，再也无计可施了，于是商量着派遣风俗大夫司国宪等人分路巡视全国，废除有关井田制度、不准买卖奴婢和征收山林湖沼税等六管制度的禁令，登上帝位以来所不便于民的诏令都收回去。
[Wang] Mang knew that the empire had got out of his control and rebelled, that matters were at a last extremity and some expedient was urgent, so he discussed sending the Grandee In Charge of Customs and Morals, Szu-kuo Hsien, and others, by divisions, to inspect the empire and to do away with the prohibitions against the ching [system of] cultivated fields, [private] slaves and slave-women, [free use of] mountains and marshes, and the [other] six monopolies, and that all the imperial edicts and ordinances since [Wang Mang] had ascended the throne, which were inconvenient to the common people, should be recalled.

待见未发，会世祖与兄齐武王伯升、宛人李通等帅舂陵子弟数千人，招致新市平林朱鲔、陈牧等合攻拔棘阳。
使者们正在等待接见还没有出发，恰好世祖和哥哥齐武王刘伯升、宛县人李通等率领春陵子弟几千人，招来新市朱鲔和平林陈牧等部联合攻下棘阳县。
[While the messengers] awaited an audience, and had not yet been sent out, it happened that the [future] Epochal Founder, [Emperor Kuang-wu, Liu Hsiu]; with his elder brother, [Liu Yin] Po-sheng, [later] King Wu of Ch'i; Li T'ung, a man from Yüan; and others led several thousand followers from Ch'ung-ling and induced Chu Wei and Ch'en Mu from Hsin-shih and P'ing-lin, and others to come. Together they attacked and took Chi-yang by storm.

是时，严尤、陈茂破下江兵，成丹、王常等数千人别走，入南阳界。
这时候，严尤和陈茂打败了下江兵，成丹和王常等几千人单独逃走，进入南阳郡境内。
At this time Chuang Yu and Ch'en Mou routed the Troops from the Lower Yangtze [Region, under] Ch'eng Tan, Wang Ch'ang, and others, [to the number of] several thousand men, and they separately fled into the borders of Nan-yang [Commandery].

十只月，有星孛于张、东南行，五日痘见。
十一月间，在张宿天区有一颗流星光芒四射，向东南运行，经过五天不见。
In the eleventh month, a comet appeared in [the constellation] Chang. It traveled southeastwards for five days and disappeared.

莽数召问太史令宗宣，诸术数家皆缪对，言天文安善，群贼且灭。
王莽几次召见、询问太史令宗宣，许多术数家都虚伪地回答，说天文现象平安良好，各股盗贼行将灭亡。
[Wang] Mang several times summoned and questioned his Chief Grand Astrologer, Tsung Hsüan, and various diviners. They all answered falsely, saying, "The astrological phenomena are peaceful and good, so that the many bandits will soon be destroyed."

莽差以自安。
王莽勉强用这些话来安慰自己。
Thereupon [Wang] Mang [felt] a little more tranquil.

四年正月，汉兵得下江王常等以为助兵，击前队大夫甄阜、属正梁丘赐，皆斩之，杀其众数万人。
四年正月，汉军得到下江王常等部作为支援，进攻前队大夫甄阜和属正梁丘赐，把他们都杀了，歼灭了他们的部队几万人。
In the fourth year, the first month, the Han troops secured [the Troops from] the Lower Yangtze [under] Wang Ch'ang and others, and made them auxiliary troops. They [together] attacked the Southern Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Chen Fou, and his Director of an Association, Liang-ch'iu Tz'u, and beheaded them both, killing several ten-thousands of their forces.

初，京师闻青、徐贼众数十万人，讫无文号旌旗表识，咸怪异之。
起初，京城听到青州和徐州盗贼部队几十万人，一直没有称号、官号、旗帜、徽章，都对他们感到惊奇。
Previously, the imperial capital had heard that the bands of bandits from Ch'ing and Hsü [Provinces] numbered several hundred-thousands of men, and yet that they had absolutely no written orders, banners, or marks of identification. [The people of the capital] all considered it a portentious prodigy.

好事者窃言：“此岂如古三皇无文书号谥邪？”
喜欢多事的人私下里说：“这些人莫不像古代的三皇不要文书、称号吧？”
and those who loved [strange] things said furtively, "Are not they like the three ancient August Ones, who had no written messages or titles?"

莽亦心怪，以问群臣，群臣莫对。
王莽也暗中感到奇怪，询问大臣们，大臣们没有人回答。
[Wang] Mang also [considered] in his heart that it was wonderful and asked his various courtiers about it. None of the various courtiers answered.

唯严尤曰：笭此不足怪也。
只有严尤说：“这不足为奇。
only Chuang Yu said, "This [circumstance] is not sufficient [to be considered] wonderful."

自黄帝、汤、武行师，必待部曲旌旗号令，今此无有者，直饥寒群盗，犬羊相聚，不知为之耳。”
自从黄帝、商汤和周武王行军用兵，都一定要有建制、旗帜和号令，现在这些人没有这些制度，只不过是一群群饥寒盗贼，像牲畜成群结伙一样，不懂得采用这些办法罢了。”
From the time that the Yellow Lord, T'ang [the Successful] and [King] Wu led their armies, [armies] have always been provided with regiments, companies, banners, and orders. These [people] who now do not have them are merely a crowd of thieves [produced by] hunger and cold, [like] dogs or sheep that have gathered together, who merely do not know how to formulate [such institutions."

莽大说，群臣尽服。
王莽非常高兴，大臣们都佩服。
Wang] Mang was greatly pleased and the various courtiers acquiesced completely.

及后汉兵刘伯升起，皆称将军，攻城略地，既杀甄阜，移书称说。
等到后来汉军刘伯升起事，都自称将军，攻打城市，占领地盘，杀死甄阜之后，发布文告，宣传自己的主张，声讨王莽的罪恶。
However later, when the Han troops [under] Liu [Yin] Po-sheng arose, [their leaders] all called [themselves] Generals. They attacked cities and overran territory. When they had killed Chen Fou, they sent letters about, giving an account of [Wang Mang's crimes.

莽闻之忧惧。
王莽听到了，才担心和害怕起来。
When Wang] Mang heard of it, he was worried and fearful.

汉兵乘胜遂围宛城。
汉军乘胜包围了宛城。
The Han troops took advantage of their victories and thereupon besieged the city of Yüan.

初，世祖族兄圣公先在平林兵中。
起初，世祖远房哥哥刘圣公先参加了平林兵。
Formerly, [Liu Hsüan] Sheng-kung, a second cousin of the Epochal Founder, [Emperor Kuang-wu], had previously been among the P'ing-lin Troops.

三月辛巳朔，平林、新市、下江兵将王常、朱鲔等共立圣公为帝，改年为更始元年，拜置百官。
三月辛巳初一，平林兵、新市兵和下江兵的将领王常和朱鲔等人共同拥立刘圣公作皇帝，改年号为更始元年，任命了各种官吏。
and, in the third month, on [the day] hsin-szu, the first day of the month, the P'ing-lin and Hsin-shih [Troops] and the Troops from the Lower Yangtze [Region], led by Wang Ch'ang, Chu Wei, and others, together set up [Liu Hsüan] Sheng-kung as the Emperor. He changed the year-[period] to be the first year of [the period] Keng-shih and installed and established a bureaucracy.

莽闻之愈恐。
王莽听到这个消息，更加惶恐。
When [Wang] Mang heard of it, he was all the more afraid.

欲外视自安，乃染其须发，进所征天下淑女杜陵史氏女为皇后，聘黄金三万斤，车马、奴婢、杂帛、珍宝以巨万计。
他想要对外表示自己的心情是安定的，于是染黑了自己的头发和胡须，召进所征选的全国的美好女子，立杜陵县史家的女儿作皇后，送彩礼黄金三万斤，车马、奴婢、各种绸绢和珍珠宝玉等贵重物品以亿万计。
He wanted to show to the world that he himself was calm, so he dyed his beard and hair and promoted the "virtuous young ladies" whom he had summoned from the empire, setting up a daughter of the Shih clan at Tu-ling as his Empress. He sent her [family] as betrothal presents 30,000 catties of actual gold, [together with] chariots and horses, slaves and slave-women, variegated silks, and precious things, which were valued by the hundred millions [of cash.

莽亲迎于前殿两阶间，成同牢之礼于上西堂。
王莽亲自在前殿两边台阶之间迎接，在上西堂举行新婚夫妇聚餐的仪式。
Wang] Mang in person welcomed her between the two stairs to the Front Hall and completed the ceremonies of the common [marriage] meal above in the Western Hall.

备和嫔、美御、和人三，位视公；嫔人九，视卿；美人二十七，视大夫；御人八十一，视元士：凡百二十人，皆佩印韨，执弓韣。
设置和嫔、美御、和人共三人，爵位比照三公；嫔人九人，爵位比照九卿；美人二十七人，爵位比照大夫；御人八十一人，爵位比照元士：共一百二十人，都佩带印信，拿着弓袋。
[The prescribed number of] Harmonious Ladies, Spouses, Beauties, and Attendants were all complete. The Harmonious Ladies were three [in number]; their rank was equal to that of the highest ministers. The Spouses were nine [in number; their rank] was equal to that of the high ministers. The Beauties were twenty-seven [in number; their rank] was equal to that of Grandees. The Attendants were eighty-one [in number; their rank] was equal to that of First Officers. Altogether there were a hundred twenty women. All wore seals with aprons at their girdles, and held bowcases.

封皇后父谌为和平侯，拜为宁始将军，谌子二人皆侍中。
赐封史皇后的父亲史谌为和平侯，授任为宁始将军，史谌的两个儿子都作侍中。
[Wang Mang] enfeoffed [Shih] Shen, the father of the Empress, as Marquis of Harmony and Peace, and installed him as General of a Peaceful Beginning. [Shih] Shen's two sons were both [made] Palace Attendants.

是日，大风发屋折木。
这一天，刮起了大风，发掘房屋，折断树木。
On that day, a great wind blew [off] roofs and broke trees.

群臣上寿曰：“乃庚子雨水洒道，辛丑清靓无尘，其夕谷风迅疾，从东北来。
大臣们祝贺说：“昨庚子日雨水洗涤了道路，辛丑日清洁宁静，了无纤尘，那天晚上东风强劲，从东北方向吹来。
When the many courtiers offered congratulations, they said, "Verily, on [the day] keng-tzu, rainwater sprinkled the highways, and on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, they were clean and pure, without any dust. That evening, the life-giving valley wind blew swiftly and promptly from the northeast."

辛丑。《巽》之宫日也。
辛丑日是《巽卦》主帝的日子。
"Hsin-ch'ou is the day of [the musical note] kung belonging to [the hexagram] sun."

《巽》为风为顺，后谊明，母道得，温和慈惠之化也。
《巽卦》象征风，它的含义是卑顺，作皇后的原则明确了，作母亲的规范具备了，这就是温和慈惠的造化功效。
"Sun [indicates] wind and [indicates] obedience. [Thus] the principles of an Empress are made plain and the way of motherhood is secured. [The whole is due to] the influence of your geniality and kindness."

《易》曰：“受兹介福，于其王母。’
《易经》说：‘赐予这样的洪福，给国王的母亲。’
"The Book of Changes says, `He will receive this great blessing from his [Queen], the Royal Mother [of the country].' "

《礼》曰：“承天之庆，万福无疆。’
《礼经》说：‘承受上天赐予的幸福，这种幸福是无限量、无止境的。’
"The [Yi-li] says, `May you receive Heaven's blessing and myriad happinesses without bounds.' "

诸欲依废汉火刘，皆沃灌雪除，殄灭无余杂矣。
凡是想要依靠已经被推翻的汉朝、以火德称王的刘家的势力，都被泼洒冲刷，消灭得彻底干净了。
"Those who intend to attach themselves to the abolished Han [dynasty], the Liu [clan, which depends upon the virtue of] fire, shall all be flooded, disappear like melting snow, and extirpated, without any remaining fragments."

百谷丰茂，庶草蕃殖，元元欢喜，兆民赖福，天下幸甚！”
庄稼丰茂，作物繁殖，人民欢喜，全民托福，全国上下都幸运得很！”
"All the grains shall be bountiful and plants shall grow abundantly. The great multitude will be glad and rejoice and the myriad common people will have the blessings that come from being good, so that the world will be greatly favored [because of you]."

莽日与方士涿郡昭君等于后宫考验方术，纵淫乐焉。
王莽每天跟方士涿郡人昭君等在后宫考究房中术，放肆荒淫享乐。
[Wang] Mang was daily in the harem with persons versed in the magical arts, Chao-chün, from Cho Commandery, and others, testing magical and technical arts and giving himself up to lustful pleasures.

大赦天下，然犹曰：“故汉氏舂陵侯群子刘伯升与其族人婚姻党及北狄胡虏逆舆洎南僰虏若豆、孟迁，不用此书。
宣布全国大赦，可是还要说：“原汉朝舂陵侯的堂房侄儿刘伯升和他的族家、亲戚、党羽，狂妄地制造流言，迷惑群众，背叛天命，还有亲手杀害更始将军廉丹和前队大夫甄阜、属正梁丘赐的人，还有北狄匈奴的叛乱头目舆和南夷贼虏若豆、孟迁，不适用这个文告。
A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. [Wang Mang] however said [in a message], "The descendants of the Marquises of Ch'ung-ling [under] the former Han dynasty, Liu [Yin] Po-sheng, with the members of his clan, his relatives by marriage, and his cabal, have falsely spread groundless rumors to delude the crowd into a treasonable rebellion against Heaven's mandate. They have by their own hands killed the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, the Southern Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Chen Fou, and his Director of an Association, Liang-ch'iu Tz'u. [To them], together with the northern barbarian caitiff, the rebel [Lüan-ti] Yü, and the southwestern barbarian caitiffs Jo Tou and Meng Ch'ien, this message [of amnesty] shall not apply."

有能捕得此人者，皆封为上公，食邑万户，赐宝货五千万。”
有能够捉到这些人的，都赐封为上公，封邑一万户，赏赐宝货五千万。”
"Whoever are able to seize these persons [Liu Yin Po-sheng, etc.], will all be enfeoffed among the highest ranking of the dukes, will be given the income of an estate of ten thousand households, and will be granted fifty million [cash] of the valuable currency."

又诏：“太师王匡、国将哀章、司命孔仁、兖州牧寿良、卒正王闳、扬州牧李圣亟进所部州郡兵凡三十万众，迫措青、徐盗贼。
又下诏书说：“太师王匡、国将哀章、司命孔仁、兖州牧寿良、卒正王闳和扬州牧李圣迅速推进所属各州郡的部队共三十万人，围剿追捕青州和徐州的盗贼。
There was also an imperial edict [saying], "The Grand Master, Wang K'uang, the State General, Ai Chang, the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], K'ung Jen, the Shepherd of Yen Province and Director of the Confederation at Shou-liang, Wang Hung, and the Shepherd of Yang Province, Li Sheng, shall quickly send forward the troops of the provinces and commanderies in the regional divisions which are their charge; altogether a force of three hundred thousand [men], in order to pursue and arrest the thieves and robbers in Ch'ing and Hsü [Provinces]."

明告以生活丹青之信，复迷惑不解散，皆并力合击，殄灭之矣！
把投降就有活路的公开保证向他们明确宣布，如果再执迷不悟，不自行解散，那就都协力围剿，歼灭他们！
"Inform them clearly with trustworthiness [like that of a painting done in] cinnabar and azurite, that [if they surrender, they shall] live, [but] if they are again deluded and do not disperse, [these leaders] will all join forces, attack unitedly, and extirpate them."

大司空隆新公，宗室戚属，前以虎牙将军东指则反虏破坏，西击则逆贼靡碎，此乃新室威宝之臣也。
大司空隆新公是皇族亲属，从前以虎牙将军的身份指向东方反贼就溃败，向西进攻叛乱头目就被粉碎，他是新朝有着崇高的权威和非凡的才能的大臣。
"Previously, when the Grand Minister of Works, the Duke Prospering the Hsin [Dynasty, Wang Yi], a relative and member of the imperial clan, as the Tiger Teeth General, went east and pointed [at them], rebellious caitiffs were routed and ruined; when he went west and attacked, seditious bandits were ground to powder. He is thus a majestic and precious minister of the Hsin House."

如黠贼不解散，将遣大司空将百万之师征伐剿绝之矣！”
如果狡猾的盗贼还不解散，就会派遣大司空统率百万大军征伐剿减他们！”
"If the crafty bandits do not disperse, I will send the Grand Minister of Works, leading an army of a million [men], to make a punitive military expedition [against them and] exterminate them."

嚣等既出，因逃亡矣。

莽闻之愈恐，遣大司空王邑驰伟至雒阳，与司徒王寻发众郡兵百万，号曰“虎牙五威兵”，平定山东。
王莽听到这个消息更加惶恐，派遣大司空王邑坐传车前往洛阳，和司徒王寻调动各郡部队上百万人，称为“虎牙五威兵”，平定山东地区。
When [Wang] Mang heard of it, he was all the more fearful, and sent the Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi, riding a galloping quadriga, to go to Lo-yang, with the [Grand] Minister Over the Masses, Wang Hsün, to mobilize the troops of numerous commanderies, [to the number of] a million [men], calling them the Tiger Teeth [Troops and] the Troops of the Five Majestic [Principles], in order to tranquillize [the region] east of the [Kuan-chung] mountains.

得颛封爵，政决于邑，除用征诸明兵法六十三家术者，各持图书，受器械，备军吏。
有权自行赐封爵位，军政大计由王邑决定，任用选调来的许多通晓六十三家兵法和战略战术的专家，每人携带图书，领用武器，候补军官。
[Wang Yi] was permitted on his own authority to raise [persons] to the nobility. [The power of] making final decisions concerning government [business was also given] to [Wang] Yi. [Wang Mang] appointed to office the [various] persons skilled in methods of the sixty-three schools of military arts whom he had summoned. Each one bore his charts and writings, received military implements and armor, and acted as a military officer.

倾府库以遣邑，多赍珍宝、猛兽，欲视饶富，用怖山东。
把所有仓库里的军需物资全都拿出来交给王邑，多带贵重物品和猛兽，想要显示朝廷的富足，用来震慑山东地区。
[Wang Mang] emptied the government storehouses in order to send out [Wang] Yi provided abundantly with precious things and wild beasts, with the purpose of showing the exceeding wealth [of the imperial forces,] in order to frighten [the region] east of the [Kuan-chung] mountains.

邑至雒阳，州郡各选精兵，牧守自将，定会者四十二万人，余在道不绝，车甲士马之盛，自古出师未尝有也。
王邑到达洛阳，各州郡分别选派了精锐的军队，由州牧和郡太守亲自率领，按照规定期限会合的有四十二万人，其余在路上的络绎不绝，人马和武器装备的威武齐全，自古以来出兵都没有过。
When [Wang] Yi reached Lo-yang, the provinces and commanderies each selected their picked troops, led by their Shepherds and Administrators in person. Those for whom a rendezvous had been appointed [numbered] more than four hundred twenty thousand men and [marched] on the highways in a continuous [stream]. From the [most] ancient [times] that armies had set forth, [such] magnificence in chariots, armor, men, and horses had never before been [seen].

六月，邑与司徒寻发雒阳，欲室宛，道出颍川，过昆阳。
六月间，王邑和大司徒王寻从洛阳出发，想要到宛县去，取道颍川郡，经过昆阳县。
In the sixth month, [Wang] Yi and the [Grand] Minister Over the Masses, [Wang] Hsün, started from Lo-yang, intending to go to Yüan. Their road went out of Ying-ch'uan [Commandery] past K'un-yang.

昆阳时已降汉，汉兵守之。
昆阳城这时已经投降汉军，汉军守卫着它。
At that time, K'un-yang had already surrendered to the Han [troops], and the Han troops were defending it.

严尤、陈茂与二公会，二公纵兵围昆阳。
严尤和陈茂跟两位统帅会合了，两位统帅指挥大军包围了昆阳城。
Chuang Yu and Ch'en Mou had joined [their troops] with [those of] the two highest ministers. When the two highest ministers [were about to] launch their troops to besiege K'un-yang.

严尤曰：“称尊号者在宛下，宜亟进。彼破，诸城自定矣。”
严尤说：“自称皇帝的人在宛城，应当迅速前进。那里攻下来了，其他城邑自然平定了。”
Chuang Yu said, "[The rebel] who has been called by the imperial title, [Liu Hsüan Sheng-kung], is below [the walls of] Yüan, [besieging it]. It would be proper to hasten and advance [to that place]. If he is routed, the various [other] cities will of their own accord be tranquillized."

邑曰：“百万之师，所过当灭，今属此城，喋血而进，前歌后舞，顾不快邪！”
王邑说：“百万大军，所经过地方的敌人都应当加以消灭，现在攻下这个县城，把里面的人杀光，踏着敌人的血泊前进，前头的部队唱着胜利歌，后头的部队跳着胜利舞，难道不痛快吗！”
[Wang] Yi replied, "Wherever an army of a million passes, it is due to annihilate [the enemy]. We will now massacre [the defenders of] this city, trample in blood, and then advance [to Yüan]. The van will sing and the rear will dance; would not that be enjoyable?"

遂围城数十重。
便包围昆阳城几十层。
Thereupon they surrounded the city several tens [of men] deep.

城中请降，不许。
城里的守军请求投降，没有允许。
[The defenders] in the city begged [for permission] to surrender [on terms], but [permission] was refused.

严尤又曰：“‘归师勿遏，围城为之阙’，可如兵法，使得逸出，以怖宛下。”
严尤又说：“‘退回去的军队不要拦截，包围城邑要给里面的人留下一个缺口’，可以按照兵法办，让他们有可能逃出去，藉以震慑宛城方面。”
Chuang Yu also said, " `When an army [wishes] to return [home], do not stop it; in besieging a city, [leave] an opening for them.' In accordance with the Military Methods you might cause them to be permitted to escape and leave [the city], and thereby frighten [the attackers of] Yüan."

邑又不听。
王邑又不听从。
Again [Wang] Yi would not listen.

会世祖悉发郾、定陵兵数千人来救昆阳，寻、邑易之，自将万余人行陈，敕诸营皆按部毋得动，独迎，与汉兵战，不利。
恰好世祖全部调动郾县和定陵县的军队几千人来援救昆阳城，王寻和王邑轻视他们，自己带领一万多人巡视阵地，告诫各军营都要约束部下不准擅自行动，自己单独迎击，跟汉军交战，不顺利。
It happened that when the Epochal Founder, [Liu Hsiu], mobilized all the troops in Yen and Ting-ling, to the number of several thousand men, and came to rescue [the defenders of] K'un-yang, [Wang] Hsün and [Wang] Yi made light of it. They themselves led more than ten thousand men and reviewed their battle-array. They ordered that the various encampments should all to be retained and that the regiments [therein] should not to be permitted to move. [Then Wang Hsün and Wang Yi] by themselves [went to] meet the Han troops. When they were not successful in battle, their great army did not presume on its own authority to rescue them.

大军不敢擅相救，汉兵乘胜杀寻。
大军不敢擅自来援救，汉军乘胜杀死了王寻。
The Han troops took advantage of their victory and killed [Wang] Hsün.

昆阳中兵出并战，邑走，军乱。
昆阳城里的守军冲出来两面夹攻，王邑逃走，军队大乱。
Simultaneously the [Han] troops inside K'un-yang came out and fought. [Wang] Yi fled and the army was in confusion.

大风飞瓦，雨如注水，大众崩坏号呼，虎豹股栗，士卒奔走，各还归其郡。
大风刮走了屋瓦，大雨像泼水，大军崩溃，大喊大叫，老虎豹子也吓得战怵起来，士兵奔逃，各自回到了自己的郡县。
A great wind blew away tiles, and the rain was as if water were being poured down, so that the great band [of soldiers] collapsed in ruin. The shouting [made even] the tigers and leopards tremble with fear in their haunches. [Wang Mang's] soldiers fled hastily, each returning to his own commandery.

邑独与所将长安勇敢数千人还雒阳。
王邑单独和他所统率的长安勇士几千人回到了洛阳。
[Wang] Yi, with only the several thousand brave and daring men from Ch'ang-an whom he commanded, returned to Lo-yang.

关中闻之震恐，盗贼并起。
关中地区听到这个消息，震动恐惧，盗贼纷纷起事。
When [the people] in Kuan-chung heard of it, they quaked with fear and thieves and robbers arose simultaneously.

既而闻汉兵言，莽鸩杀孝平帝。
又听到汉军说，王莽毒死了汉平帝。
Since it was moreover reported that the Han troops said that [Wang] Mang had murdered Emperor Hsiao-ping by poison.

莽乃会公卿以下于王路堂，开所为平帝请命金滕之策，泣以视群臣。
王莽于是集合公卿以下官吏到王路堂，打开他所作的替平帝请求解除疾病、保全性命而后来收藏在保险柜里的策书，流着泪把它给大臣们看。
[Wang] Mang thereupon assembled, in the Hall With the Royal Apartments, the ministers and those [ranking] below and opened the metal-bound document in which he had begged [to substitute his own] life for that of Emperor P'ing. He wept silently as he showed it to his various courtiers.

命明学男张邯称说其德及符命事，因曰：“《易》言‘伏戎于莽，升其高陵，三岁不兴。’
吩咐明学男张邯称道他的德行和有关符命的事情，乘机说：“《易经》说：‘把军队埋伏在茂密的草丛中，登上高大的土山了望，不敢前进，直到三年都不能兴起。’
He commanded the Baron of Brilliant Scholarship, Chang Han, to state and explain the virtue [of the power, earth, which brought] him, [Wang Mang, to the throne], together with the mandates [given him through] portents. Thereupon [Chang Han] said, "The Book of Changes says, `He hides his weapons in a thicket (mang), Mounts (sheng) a high mound (kao-ling), And in the third year he will not prosper.' "

‘莽’，皇帝之名，‘升’谓刘伯升。
‘莽’是皇帝的名字。‘升’是说刘伯升。
"Mang is the personal name of the Emperor; sheng means Liu [Yin] Po-sheng;"

‘高陵’谓高陵侯子翟义也。
‘高陵’是说高陵侯的儿子翟义。
"kao-ling means Chai Yi, the son of the Marquis of Kao-ling, [Chai Fang-chin]."

言刘升、翟义为伏戎之兵于新皇帝世，犹殄灭不兴也。”
说刘伯升和翟义在新皇帝的时代建立地下武装，还是会被消灭不能成功。”
It means that Liu [Yin Po]-sheng and Chai Yi will have troops with "hidden weapons in" [the reign of Wang "Mang"], the Emperor of the Hsin [House], but yet will be extirpated and "will not prosper."

群臣皆称万岁。
大臣们都喊“万岁”。
The courtiers all called out, "Long life!"

又令东方槛车传送数人，言“刘伯升等皆行大戮”。
又命令东方用囚车传送几个人，说“这就是刘伯升等人，都会被处死”。
[Wang Mang] also ordered carriages with cages to transport several men from the eastern quarter [of the empire], saying that [these men] were Liu [Yin] Po-sheng and the others. All of them underwent the grand exposure [of their corpses.

民知其诈也。
百姓知道那是假的。
But] the common people knew that it was false.

先是，卫将军王涉一向供养道士西门君惠。
早先，卫将军王涉一向供养着道士西门君惠。
Previous to this, the General of the Guard, Wang Shê, had kept a gentleman versed in the ways of magic, Hsi-men Chün-hui.

君惠好天文谶记，为涉言：“星孛扫宫室，刘氏当复兴，国师公姓名是也。”
西门君惠爱好天文谶讳，对王涉说：“有一颗星光芒四射，扫射皇宫，刘家会要复兴，国师公的姓名就是。”
[Hsi-men] Chün-hui loved astrology and prophetic accounts. He said to [Wang] Shê, "A comet has swept in the [Heavenly] Palace, [hence] the Liu clan is due to be restored. [The next emperor] will have the surname and given name of the State Master and Highest Minister."

涉信其言，以语大司马董忠，数俱至国师殿中庐道语星宿，国师不应。
王涉相信了他的话，把它告诉了大司马董忠，多次一同到国师在殿中的值班室谈论星宿，国师没有回答。
[Wang] Shê believed his words, and spoke of them to the Commander-in-chief, Tung Chung, who urged that they both go to the private apartments of the State Master, [Liu Hsin], in the [Palace] Hall and talk to him about the zodiacal constellation. [But] the State Master did not respond.

后涉特往，对歆涕泣言：“诚欲与公共安宗族，奈何不信涉也！”
后来王涉特此前往，对刘歆流着泪说：“的确是想要跟您共同保护我们两个家族的安全，为什么不相信我呢！”
Later [Wang] Shê went alone to him. He wept silently before [Liu] Hsin and said, "I really wish with you, Duke, to bring peace to our clans. Alas, why will you not believe me, [Wang] Shê?"

歆于是为言天文人事，东方必成。
刘歆于是给他谈论天文人事，东方军队必定成功。
Thereupon [Liu] Hsin said to him that, [according to] the astrological phenomena and human affairs, [the insurgents] in the eastern quarter, were bound to succeed.

涉曰：“新都哀侯小被病，功显君素耆酒，疑帝本非我家子。
王涉说：“新都哀侯从小得病，功显君一向好酒，怀疑皇帝本来就不是我们王家的儿子。
[Wang] Shê said, "Marquis Ai of Hsin-tu, [Wang Wan, Wang Mang's father], suffered from illness when he was young, and the Baronetess of Apparent Merits, [Wang Mang's mother], habitually loved wine. I suspect that the Emperor was not in his origin a child of my clan."

董公主管中军精兵，涉领宫卫，伊休侯主殿中，如同心合谋，共劫持帝，东降南阳天子，可以全宗族；
董公主管中军精兵，我率领宫廷警卫部队，伊休侯主管殿中警卫，如果我们几个同心合谋，一起劫持皇帝，向东方投降现在驻在南阳郡的天子，就可以保全我们的家族；
His excellency Tung [Chung] has charge of the picked troops in the Palace Encampments. I, [Wang] Shê, command the Palace Guard; the Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu Tieh], is in charge inside the [Palace] Hall. If we unitedly cooperate in the plot, together seize the Emperor by force, and surrender to the Son of Heaven in Nan-yang [Commandery] to the east, [Liu Hsüan Sheng-kung, we] will be able to preserve our clans;"

不者，俱夷灭矣！”
不然的话，都会杀身灭族啊！”
If not, we will all be executed and our clans annihilated."

伊休侯者，歆长子也，为侍中五官中朗将，莽素爱之。
伊休侯是刘歆的长子，担任侍中五宫中郎将，王莽一向喜爱他。
The Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu] Tieh, was [Liu] Hsin's eldest son. He was a Palace Attendant and General of the Fifth Rank Gentlemen-at-the Palace. [Wang] Mang habitually loved him.

歆怨莽杀其三子，又畏大祸至，遂与涉、忠谋，欲发。
刘歆怨恨王莽杀死了他的三个儿女，又畏惧大祸临头，便跟王涉和董忠谋划，想要行动。
[Liu] Hsin held a grudge [because Wang] Mang had killed three of his children, and also feared that the great calamity [of execution] would come upon him. Consequently he plotted with [Wang] Shê and [Tung] Chung.

歆曰：“当待太白星出，乃可。”
刘歆说：“应当等待太白星出现，才可以行动。”
When they wanted to act, [Liu] Hsin said, "We must wait until [the planet] Venus appears, and then only may we [act]."

忠以司中大赘起武侯孙伋亦主兵，复与伋谋。
董忠因为司中大赘起武侯孙伋也主管军队，又与孙伋商量。
Because the Director of the Palace and Grand Keeper of the Robes, the Marquis Raising Military Power, Sun Chi, also controlled troops, [Tung] Chung also plotted with [Sun] Chi.

伋归家，颜色变，不能食。
孙伋回到家里，脸色变了，吃不下饭。
When [Sun] Chi returned to his home, the color of his face had changed and he could not eat.

妻怪问之，语其状。
他的妻子感到奇怪，便问他，他把那些情况告诉了她。
When his wife marvelled and asked him about it, he told her the circumstances.

妻以告弟云阳陈邯，邯欲告之。
他的妻子把这些情况告诉了她的弟弟云阳县人陈邯，陈邯想要告发他们。
His wife told it to her younger brother, Ch'en Han, a man from Yün-yang, and [Ch'en] Han wanted to give information about it.

七月，伋与邯俱告，莽遣使者分召忠等。
七月间，孙伋和陈邯一同去告发了，王莽派遣使者分别召唤董忠等人。
In the seventh month, [Sun] Chi and [Ch'en] Han together gave information [about the plot. Wang] Mang sent commissioners separately to summon [Tung] Chung and the others.

时忠方进兵都肄，护军王咸谓忠谋久不发，恐漏泄，不如遂斩使者，勒兵入。
这时董忠正在讲习武事进行大练兵，护军王咸说董忠谋划已经很久而不行动，恐怕走露了风声，不如就杀掉使者，率领军队进去。
[Tung] Chung was just at that time teaching military [methods] at a grand review [of his troops]. His Commissioner Over the Army, Wang Hsien, said to [Tung] Chung, "Your plot has been made for some time but no action has been taken, so that I fear it has been divulged. It would be better immediately to behead the commissioner, take command of your troops, and enter [the Palace to carry out the plot."

忠不听，遂与歆、涉会省户下。
董忠不听从，于是和刘歆、王涉在宫中大臣官署会合。
But Tung] Chung did not listen [to him], and consequently joined [Liu] Hsin and [Wang] Shê outside the gate of the inner [Palace] apartments.

莽令恽责问，皆服。
王莽让恽责问他们，都承认了。
[Wang] Mang ordered Tai Yün to interrogate them under torture, and all confessed.

中黄门各拔刃将忠等送庐，忠拔剑欲自刎，侍中王望传言大司马反，黄门持剑共格杀之。
宫内太监们抽出刀来把董忠等人送到他们的值班室去，董忠抽出剑来想要抹脖子，侍中王望传告说大司马造反，太监们拿着剑一同杀死了他。
Palace Attendants Within the Yellow Gate, all with swords drawn, conducted [Tung] Chung and the others to an antechamber. [Tung] Chung drew his sword with the intention of cutting his own throat. A Palace Attendant, Wang Wang, reported that the Commander-in-chief, [Tung] Chung, had rebelled. [The Palace Attendants Within] the Yellow Gate had drawn their swords, and jointly fought with and killed [Tung] Chung.

省中相惊传，勒兵至郎署，皆拔刃张弩。
大臣官署一片惊慌，互相传告，正在集中训练的士兵纷纷涌到郎官衙门，都是刀出鞘、箭上弓。
[The people in] the inner [palace] apartments frightened one another by the report that troops under a command would arrive. [The Gentlemen] in the Gentlemen's quarters all drew their swords and cocked their crossbows.

更始将军史谌行诸署，告郎吏曰：“大司马有狂病，发，已诛。”
更始将军史谌巡视各郎官衙门，告诉郎官们说：“大司马神经错乱，妄图造反，刚刚发动，已被处死。”
The General of a New Beginning, Shih Shen, visited the various quarters and informed the Gentlemen and officials, saying, "The Commander-in-chief, [Tung] Chung, had [a spell] of insanity come upon him; he has already been executed."

皆令驰兵，莽欲以厌凶，使虎贲以斩马剑挫忠，盛以竹器，传曰“反虏出”。
命令他们都放下武器。王莽想要拿董忠来厌胜灾祸，让虎贲勇士用斩马剑剁碎董忠，用竹器盛着，传告说“反贼出来了”。
All are ordered to unbend their weapons." [Wang] Mang wanted to repress any baneful influence, so had the [Gentlemen] As Rapid As Tigers use a sword for beheading horses to cut off [Tung] Chung's [head], put it in a bamboo vessel, and sent it about [the empire, with a label] saying, "A rebellious caitiff who has left [his office]."

下书赦大司马官属吏士为忠所诖误，谋反未发觉者。
下文告赦免大司马下属官吏和军官士兵被董忠所蒙蔽，参与造反还没有被发觉的。
[Wang Mang] issued a message of amnesty to the officers and soldiers belonging to the office of the Commander-in-chief, who had been led into error by [Tung] Chung, had plotted to rebel, and had not yet been discovered.

收忠宗族，以醇醯毒药、尺白刃丛棘并一坎而埋之。
逮捕董忠的家族，用浓醋、毒药和小刀子、棘条子合成一穴埋葬了他们。
He had the clan and relatives of Tung Chung arrested, and buried them together in one pit with strong vinegar, poisonous drugs, foot[long] naked two-edged blades, and a thicket of thorns.

刘歆、王涉皆自杀。
刘歆和王涉都自杀了。
Liu Hsin and Wang Shê both committed suicide.

莽以二人骨肉旧臣，恶其内溃，故隐其诛。
王莽因为这两个人是至亲和老部下，嫌厌人家说他的内部崩溃了，所以不公开宣布对他们的惩罚。
[Wang] Mang considered that [one] of these two persons was [of the same] flesh and blood [as himself and the other was] a minister [who had been in office] for a long [time, so,] because [Wang Mang] disliked [it to be known] that these [persons] within [the court] had been infected [with evil], he kept their execution secret.

伊休侯叠又以素谨，歆讫不告，但免侍中中郎将，更为中散大夫。
伊休侯刘叠又因为一向谨慎，刘歆一直没有把他们的计划告诉他，祇免掉了侍中中郎将，改任中散大夫。
Because moreover the Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu] Tieh, had constantly been circumspect and [Liu] Hsin had finally not informed [Liu Tieh of the plot], he was merely dismissed [from his posts as] Palace Attendant and General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, and was changed to be a Palace Grandee Without Specified Appointment.

后日殿中钩盾土山仙人掌旁有白头公青衣，郎吏见者私谓之国师公。
后来殿中假山仙人掌旁边出现了穿着青衣的白发老头，看见了的郎官私下里说那是国师公。
A day later, in the [Palace] Hall, beside the palm [of the hand] of the immortal on the hill of earth [in the park under the charge of] the Intendant of the Imperial Palace Parks, there was a white-headed old man in cerulean clothes. The Gentlemen and officials who saw it said privately that it was the State Master and Highest Minister, [Liu Hsin].

衍功侯喜素善卦，莽使筮之，曰：“忧兵火。”
衍功侯王喜一向会占卦，王莽让他用蓍草占了一卦，说：“担心兵灾火灾。”
The Marquis of Vast Merit, [Wang] Hsi, was usually good with the hexagrams, [so Wang] Mang had him to interpret its divination. He said, "One should be careful about weapons and fire."

莽曰：“小儿安得此左道？是乃予之皇祖叔父子侨欲来迎我也。”
王莽说：“小孩子怎么学会了这些邪门旁道？这是我的皇祖先叔父王子侨要来接我了。”
[Wang] Mang replied, "How did you, boy, get this erroneous explanation? This is indeed my august ancestor's younger uncle, [Wang] Tzu-ch'iao, who has wanted to come and invite me [to become an immortal]."

莽军师外破，大臣内畔，左右亡所信，不能复远念郡国，欲呼邑与计议。
王莽的军队在外面吃了败仗，大臣们在内部进行颠覆，身边没有人可资信任了，不能够再考虑远方的郡国，想要叫王邑回来跟他商量。
When, outside [the court, Wang] Mang's armies had been routed and, inside [the court], his greatest ministers had rebelled, so that none of those about him could be trusted, he could no longer deliberate [with them] about matters at a distance in the commanderies and kingdoms. When he wanted to summon [Wang] Yi and make plans with him.

崔发曰：“邑素小心，今失大众而征，恐其执节引决，宜有以大慰其意。”
崔发说：“王邑一向小心，现在损失了大军再调回，恐怕他持忠义而自杀，应当想办法好好安慰一下他的心情。”
Ts'ui Fa said, "[Wang] Yi is habitually cautious. Now that he has lost a large force, if he is summoned, I fear that he will grasp his credentials and commit suicide. It would be proper that you should in some great manner console his feelings."

于是莽遣发驰传谕邑：“我年老毋適子，欲传邑以天下。敕亡得谢，见勿复道。”
于是王莽派遣崔发坐传车去晓谕王邑道：“我年老了，没有正妻生的儿子，想要把国家政权传给你。命令你不要检讨罪责，相见时不要再说到那些事情。”
Thereupon [Wang] Mang sent [Ts'ui] Fa in a galloping quadriga with verbal instructions for [Wang] Yi, [saying], "I am aged and have no son by my legitimate wives. I wish to transmit the empire to you, Yi. It is ordered that you shall not need to beg pardon [for your defeat] and when I receive you in audience you shall not again speak [of the past]."

邑到，以为大司马。
王邑到达，任命他作大司马。
[When Wang] Yi arrived, he was made the Commander-in-chief.

大长秋张邯为大司徒，崔发为大司空，司中寿容苗欣为国师，同说侯林为卫将军。
大长秋张邯担任大司徒，崔发担任大司空，司中寿容人苗欣担任国师，同说侯王林担任卫将军。
The Grand Prolonger of Autumn, Chang Han, became the Grand Minister Over the Masses. Ts'ui Fa became the Grand Minister of Works. The Director of the Palaces and Shelterer of Long Life, Miao Hsin, became the State Master. The Marquis of Like Delight, [Wang] Lin, became the General of the Guard.

莽忧懑不能食，亶饮酒，啖鳆鱼。

[Wang] Mang was so distressed and worried that he could not eat. He only drank wine, ate shellfish.

读军书倦，因凭几寐，不复就枕矣。
阅读军书疲倦了，便靠着几案打盹儿，不再上床睡觉。
and read books on military matters. When he was tired, he would rest [his head] upon his stool and sleep without again seeking his pillow.

性好时日小数，及事迫急，亶为厌胜。
王莽生性喜好鬼神符命，到了事情紧急时，便用咒术去压制。
By nature, [Wang] Mang loved the numerology of lucky times and days. When moreover matters became urgent, he merely repressed them by incantations.

遣使坏渭陵、延陵园门罘罳，曰：“毋使民复思也。”
派遣使者去拆毁渭陵和延陵墓门的屏纲，说道：“不要让人民再想起汉朝了。”
He sent a commissioner to destroy the screening walls at the gates to the parks of the Wei Tomb and the Yen Tomb, saying, "Do not cause the common people to think of the Han [Dynasty] again."

又以墨洿色其周垣。
又用墨汁涂黑它们的围墙。
He also used black to defile the color of their surrounding walls.

号将至曰“岁宿”，申水为“助将军”，右庚“刻木校尉”，前丙“耀金都尉”，又曰“执大斧，伐枯木；流大水，灭发火。”
称将军为“岁宿”，申水为“助将军”，还有右庚“刻木校尉”、前丙“耀金都尉”，又说：“拿着大斧，砍伐枯木；流出大水，淹没残火。”
He entitled his generals, "The general for whom [the planet] Jupiter rests in [the cyclical sign] shen and [the element] water is an assistant," "the Colonel who honors [the cyclical sign] keng and injures [the element] wood," and "the Chief Commandant who sets [the cyclical sign] ping in front and glorifies [the element] metal." He also [gave titles] reading, "[The military leader] holding a great axe to chop down withered wood," [and, "The military leader] causing great waters to run, extinguishing any fire that has arisen."

如此属不可胜记。
像这一类把戏，多得无法记载。
The things of this sort [that he did and said are too many] to be recorded completely.

Wei Ts'ui and his elder brother, [Wei Yi, men from] Ch'eng-chi, together kidnapped the Grand Governor [of T'ien-shui Commandery], Li Yü. They made their elder brother's son, Wei Ao, their General-in-chief, and attacked and killed the Shepherd of Yung Province, Ch'en Ch'ing, and the Director of a Confederation at An-ting [Commandery], Wang Hsün, and joined his force [with their own]. They sent a letter to the commanderies and counties enumerating [Wang] Mang's crimes and wickednesses, [saying that they were] ten thousand [times the number of those committed by] Chieh and Chou.

崔发言：“《周礼》及《春秋左氏》，国有大灾，则哭以厌之。故《易》称‘先号啕而后笑’。宜呼嗟告天以求救。”
崔发说：“《周礼》和《春秋左氏传》说，国家有了大灾难，就哭着去厌胜它。所以《易经》说‘首先放声大哭，后来才笑’。我们可以长吁短叹祷告上天祈求救助。”
Ts'ui Fa said, "[According to] the Chou Offices and Mr. Tso's [Commentary on] the Spring and Autumn, whenever a state has a great visitation, [the ruler] should weep, in order to repress [the evil]. Hence the Book of Changes says, `He at first wails and cries out, but later laughs.' It would be proper to cry out and sigh, in giving information to Heaven, in order to seek for rescue."

莽自知败，乃率群臣至南郊，陈其符命本末，仰天曰：“皇天既命授臣莽，何不殄灭众贼？即令臣莽非是，愿下雷霆诛臣莽！”
王莽自己知道失败了，便率领大批臣子到南郊，陈述他承受符命的首尾经过，仰天说道：“上天既然降命把国家政权交给我王莽，为什么不消灭那些盗贼？假使我王莽不对，希望您降下霹雷打死我王莽！”
[Wang] Mang himself knew that he would be defeated, but he led his courtiers to the Southern Place for the Suburban Sacrifice [to Heaven], set out his mandates [by means of] portents from first to last, looked up to Heaven, and said, "Since thou, August Heaven, hast given thy mandate to thy subject, Mang, why doest thou not immediately order extirpated the bands [of troops] and the robbers? But if thy servant Mang has done wrong, I wish that thou wouldst send down thy thunderbolt to execute thy servant Mang."

因搏心大哭，气尽，伏而叩头。
于是捶胸大哭，哭不出声来了，伏地叩头。
Thereupon he struck his heart with his palm and wept loudly. When his breath was exhausted, he prostrated himself and knocked his head [upon the ground].

又作告天策，自陈功劳，千余言。
又写了一篇告天的策书，陈述自己的功劳，有一千多字。

Those who were [really] melancholy, together with those who were able to recite the words of his document, were made Gentlemen. [They numbered] more than five thousand persons.

恽将领之。

The Red Eyebrows thereupon burnt the palace-buildings, market-places, and wards in Ch'ang-an, and killed the Keng-shih [Emperor].

民饥饿相食，死者数十万，长安为虚，城中无人行。
百姓饥饿以致人吃人，死亡的有几十万人，长安成为废墟，城里没有人行走。
The common people starved and [even] ate others, so that the dead [numbered] several hundred thousand, Ch'ang-an became a waste, and inside the city walls there were no people going about.

宗庙园陵皆发掘，唯霸陵、杜陵完。
汉朝的宗庙和皇帝陵墓都被发掘，衹有霸陵、杜陵完好。
The [imperial ancestral] temples, funerary parks, and tomb mounds were all dug up; only the Pa Tomb and the Tu Tomb were preserved intact.

六月，世祖即位，然后宗庙社稷复立，天下艾安。
六月，世祖登上皇位，然后宗届社稷重新建立，全国太平。
In the sixth month, the Epochal Exemplar, [Emperor Kuang-wu], had ascended the throne, and thereafter the [imperial] ancestral temples and the mounds to the gods of the soils and grains were re-established [at Lo-yang], the empire was well governed and at peace.

赞曰：“王莽始起外戚，折节力行，以要名誉，宗族称孝，师友归仁。
赞曰：王莽起初凭借外戚身份兴起，降低身份努力行事，来获取名誉，宗族称赞他孝顺，老师朋友称许他仁爱。
In eulogy we say: Wang Mang first arose [because he was one of] the maternal relatives [of Emperor Ch'eng]. He humbled himself and acted energetically, in order to seek for fame and reputation, so that his clan praised him as filial and his teachers and associates attributed benevolence to him.

及其居位辅政，成、哀之际，勤劳国家，直道而行，动见称述。
等到他身居高位辅佐朝政，在成帝、哀帝时期，为国家辛勤操劳，按正直的原则行事，一举一动常被人称道。
When he occupied [a high] position and acted as [chief] assistant in the government, [during] the time in [the reigns of Emperors] Ch'eng and Ai, he toiled diligently for the state and "pursued a straightforward course," [so that whenever he] acted, [his deeds] were reported in detail.

岂所谓 “在家必闻，在国必闻”，“色取仁而行违” 者邪？
难道他就是人们所说的 “在家族中一定有名声，在国家中一定有名声”，“表面上追求仁爱而行动上却违背仁爱” 的人吗？
Was he not [the sort of person] referred to [in the sayings, "Such a man will certainly be heard of in his clan; he will certainly be heard of in his state," and "He assumes the appearance of benevolence, but his actions are contrary to it?"]

莽既不仁而有佞邪之材，又乘四父历世之权，遭汉中微，国统三绝，而太后寿考为之宗主，故得肆其奸惹，以成篡盗之祸。
王莽没有仁爱之心却有奸邪的才能，又利用四位伯父、叔父世代掌握的权力，遇上汉朝中途衰落，皇位三次断绝，而王太后长寿成为他的靠山，所以能够放纵他的奸诈邪恶，从而造成篡夺窃取政权的灾祸。
Since [Wang] Mang did not [possess] benevolence, but had a talent for flattery and evil and also took advantage of the power his four uncles, [Wang Feng, Wang Yin, Wang Shang, and Wang Ken, had exercised for] successive generations, and [because] it happened that the Han [dynasty] became weak in the midst [of its period] and the dynastic succession was thrice broken, so that in her old age the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] became the mistress of the [imperial] clan, hence [Wang Mang] was able to give free rein to his viciousness and thereby to bring to pass the calamity of his usurpation [of the throne].

推是言之，亦天时，非人力之致矣。
从这些来看，也是天时，不是人力所能做到的。
If we speak of [the situation by] investigating it from this [aspect], it was a time [set by] Heaven and not brought about by human effort.

及其窃位南面，处非所据，颠覆之势险于桀、纣，而莽晏然自以黄、虞复出也。
等到他窃取皇位面向南坐，处在不该占据的位置上，败亡的形势比夏桀、商纣还要危险，而王莽却安然自得地认为自己是黄帝、虞舜再世。
When he had stolen the throne and faced south, so that he occupied [a position which] he should not have seized, the influences which would overthrow [such a person] were more dangerous [in his case than in the cases of] Chieh and Chou, yet [Wang] Mang was tranquil and considered himself a second appearance of the Yellow [Lord] and Yü [Shun].

乃始恣睢，奋其威诈，滔天虐民，穷凶极恶，流毒诸夏，乱延蛮貉，犹未足逞其欲焉。
于是开始放纵暴戾，施展他的威势诈骗，罪恶滔天，残害百姓，穷凶极恶，流毒中原，祸乱蔓延到外族，还不能满足他的欲望。
Then for the first time he gave rein to his desires and displayed his tyrannousness and deceitfulness, being scornfully [hypocritical] towards Heaven and oppressive towards the common people, exhausting [the possibilities of] banefulness, and [attaining] the limit of evil. His poison diffused itself among all Chinese and [his power of causing] disorder [even] extended to the southern and northern barbarians, but this did not yet satisfy his desires.

是以四海之内，嚣然丧其乐生之心，中外愤怨，远近俱发，城池不守，支体分裂，遂令天下城邑为虚，丘垅发掘，害遍生民，辜及朽骨，自书传所载乱臣贼子无道之人，考其祸败，未有如莽之甚者也。
因此天下人纷纷忧愁失去了活下去的念头，朝廷内外怨愤，远近同时起兵，城池守不住，身体被分裂，终于使天下城邑成为废墟，坟墓被发掘，祸害遍及活人，连朽骨也未能幸免，自从有书册记载以来的乱臣贼子、无道之人，考察他们的灾祸失败，没有像王莽这样严重的。
For this reason, [all] within the four seas murmured sadly and lost their joy in life. Within and outside [the country, people] were filled with resentment, [braves] far and near [the capital] all mobilized, his city-wall and moat was not defended, so that his members were cut to pieces. Thereupon he caused the cities and towns of the empire to become wastes, [while peoples'] grave mounds were [moreover] dug into, so that he injured all living people, and his crimes reached [even] to rotten bones. Of the rebellious ministers and evil sons and of the unprincipled men who are recorded in books and records, if we investigate the calamities [they produced] and the ruin [they wrought], there have not been any as severe as [those produced by Wang] Mang.

昔秦燔《诗》、《书》以立私议，莽诵《六艺》以文奸言，同归殊途，俱用灭亡，皆炕龙绝气，非命之运，紫色蛙声，余分闰位，圣王之驱除云尔！
从前秦朝焚毁《诗经》《尚书》来确立自己的主张，王莽引述《六经》来粉饰奸邪的言论，殊途同归，都因此灭亡，都是阳气过盛而得不到承接，不是天命所归，如同紫色冒充正色、蛙声当作正声，如同闰月扰乱了正常的时序，祇是圣王要扫除的对象罢了！
Anciently [the First Emperor of] the Ch'in [dynasty] burnt the Books of Odes and of History in order to establish his private proposals, while [Wang] Mang chanted the six canons in order to gloss over his wicked words. "They came to the same result but by different paths;" both thereby [came to] destruction. They were both "dragons [who had flown] too high" and whose breath was cut off, which was not the destiny [originally bestowed upon them by Heaven's] decree. They were [like] a purple color or a croaking sound, or the leftover minutes [that are given] the place of an intercalation, which are driven out by a sage-king.
