[Wang] Mang also said, "When previously I was Regent, I founded a temple for the suburban sacrifices, established a temple for the distant ancestors, and set up [an altar for] the gods of the soils and grains.

In the age of the original ancestor of the Han dynasty, the Lord of T'ang, [Yao], there was the model for transmitting the state [to another dynasty]. I myself in turn received the metal charter from the genius of Emperor Kao of the Han [dynasty].

[莽]又曰：“予前在大麓，至于摄假，深惟汉氏三七之厄，赤德气尽，思索广求，所以辅刘延期之术，靡所不用，以故作金刀之利，几以济之。
[王莽]又说：“我以前在担任要职直到摄政代行皇帝职权时，深切考虑汉朝二百一十年的厄运，火德气数已尽，想尽各种办法辅助刘家延续政权，无所不用，因此制作了有利的金刀货币，希望能挽救它。
[Wang Mang] also said, "When I previously was in [the position of] the chief director [of the administration, and became Regent and Acting [Emperor], I pondered deeply the dangers [at the end of] the three [times] seven [decades] of the Han dynasty, that the emanation of virtue from the Red [Lord] was exhausted, and I thought and sought, searching widely for means whereby I might support the Liu [house] and lengthen its period [on the throne]. There was nothing that I failed to do. For that reason, I made the beneficial metal knife-[money], hoping thereby to assist [the dynasty].

然自孔子作《春秋》以为后王法，至于哀之十四而一代毕，协之于今，亦哀之十四也。
然而自从孔子作《春秋》为后代帝王树立法则，到鲁哀公十四年一个时代结束，与现在相对照，也是汉哀帝以来的十四年。
Nevertheless when Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn to make it a model for later kings, [he continued it] until the fourteenth year of [Duke] Ai [of Lu], when one age ended. Comparing it with present [times], it was also fourteen years [after Emperor] Ai [ascended the throne that the Han dynasty ended its rule].

赤世计尽，终不可强济。
火德的气数已尽，终究不能勉强挽救。
Since the calculated [number of years allotted] for the age of the Red [Lord] was exhausted, I could not eventually have the power to save [that dynasty].

Now the people all say that August Heaven has dethroned the Han [dynasty] and set up the Hsin [dynasty], that he has dismissed the Liu [clan from the throne] and caused the Wang [clan] to rise.


夫‘刘’之为字‘卯、金、刀’也，正月刚卯，金刀之利，皆不得行。
‘刘’字由‘卯、金、刀’组成，正月的刚卯佩饰，金刀货币的便利，都不得再通行。

Thereupon [the coinage] was changed and there were made small cash, 6 fen in diameter, weighing one shu. Their inscription said, "A diminutive cash, worth one [cash]." Together with the preceding large cash, [which were worth], fifty [of the smaller cash], there were two denominations [of coins] circulating at the same time.

同宗人田单大设奇谋，擒杀燕将，重新安定齐国。
a man of his clan, T'ien Tan, made extensive and clever plans, captured and killed a general of Yen, and re-established the state of Ch'i.

莽曰：“古者，设庐井八家，一夫一妇田百亩，什一而税，则国给民富而颂声作。
王莽说：“古代，实行井田制，八家共居一井，一夫一妇分田一百亩，按十分之一收税，就能国家富足、百姓富裕，歌颂之声兴起。
[Wang Mang] said [in a message], "When the ancients established the cottages of eight families on the ching [system] and one husband and one wife had a hundred mou of cultivated land and paid one-tenth in taxes, then the state had enough and the common people were opulent and composed songs of praise.

此唐、虞之道，三代所遵行也。
这是唐尧、虞舜的治国之道，夏、商、周三代所遵行的制度。
The foregoing was the way of T'ang [Yao] and of Yü [Shun], and that which the three dynasties practised obediently.

秦为无道，厚赋税以自供奉，罢民力以极欲，坏圣制，废井田，是以兼并起，贪鄙生，强者规田以千数，弱者曾无立锥之居。
秦朝不行正道，加重赋税以供自己挥霍，耗尽民力以满足无穷欲望，破坏圣人制度，废除井田制，因此兼并土地的现象出现，贪婪卑鄙的行为滋生，强者占田数千亩，弱者竟无立锥之地。
The [state of] Ch'in was inhuman and made the taxes heavy, in order that [the ruler] might himself have [a large] income. [The ruler] exhausted the strength of the common people in order to satisfy his desires to the utmost. He destroyed the institutions of the sages and did away with the ching [system of] cultivated fields. For this reason the taking posession of and joining together [of fields by the wealthy] arose and avarice and vileness was born. The strong made designs to secure cultivated fields by the thousands [of mou] and the weak [even] lacked [enough of] a habitation in which to stand up an awl.

又置奴婢之市，与牛马同兰，制于民臣，颛断其命。
又设置买卖奴婢的市场，把奴婢与牛马同栏，由臣民控制，擅自决定他们的命运。
[That state] also established market-places for male and female slaves, putting [human beings] in like enclosures with those for cattle and horses. In their rule over their common people and subjects, [the Ch'in rulers] arbitrarily cut short their [very] lives, and villainous and oppressive persons took advantage of the opportunity to make profits,

奸虐之人因缘为利，至略卖人妻子，逆天心，悖人伦，缪于“天地之性人为贵”之义。
奸诈残暴之徒借此牟利，甚至掠卖他人的妻子儿女，违背天意，悖逆人伦，不符合“天地之间人最尊贵”的道理。
even kidnapping and selling other peoples' wives and children, going contrary to the will of Heaven and disordering human relationships, which is contradictory to the principle that `of all living things, [i.e., animals and plants, produced by] Heaven and Earth, man is the noblest.'

《书》曰“予则奴戮女”，唯不用命者，然后被此辜矣。
《尚书》说“我就要把你降为奴隶或处死”，衹有不服从命令的人，才会遭受这种惩罚。
The Book of History says, `[If you do not obey my commands], I will thereupon enslave and dishonor you,' [according to which passage] only those who did not obey [the king's] commands should indeed suffer this punishment [of being enslaved].


汉氏减轻田租，三十而税一，常有更赋，罢癃咸出，而豪民侵陵，分田劫假。
汉朝减轻田租，按三十分之一征税，却常有更赋，残疾之人也都要缴纳，而豪强侵犯欺压百姓，通过租佃关系掠夺财物。
The Han dynasty reduced and lightened the land tax, taking [only] one-thirtieth, [but in addition] there were regularly [required] conscript service and capitation-taxes, which [even] the sick and aged were all required to pay, while powerful common people encroached upon [the poor, letting their own] fields [out on] shares, robbing [people] by the rentals [required for their land, so that while] in name they were taxed only one-thirtieth, in reality they are taxed or pay as rent five-tenths of their produce.

厥名三十税一，实什税五也。
名义上是三十分之一的税，实际上是十分之五的税。
in reality they are taxed or pay as rent five-tenths of their produce.

父子夫妇终年耕芸，所得不足以自存。
父子夫妇整年耕种，收入不够维持自己的生活。

故富者犬马余菽粟，骄而为邪；贫者不厌糟糠，穷而为奸。
因此富人的犬马有吃不完的粮食，骄横作恶；穷人连糟糠都吃不饱，因贫困而行奸邪之事。
Hence the horses and dogs of the rich had surplus beans and grain and [the rich] were proud and did evil, while the poor could not satiate themselves with brewer's grains, became destitute, and acted wickedly.

俱陷于辜，刑用不错。
都陷入犯罪的境地，刑罚因此不能停止使用。
Both [rich and poor] fell into crime, so that the punishments had to be employed and could not be set aside.


予前在大麓，始令天下公田口井，时则有嘉禾之祥，遭以虏逆贼且止。
我以前在担任要职时，开始命令天下的公田按人口划分井田，当时出现了嘉禾的祥瑞，后因遭到叛贼侵扰而暂停。
When previously I was the chief director [of the administration], I first ordered that the empire's public cultivated fields [should be organized on] the ching [system according to the number] of persons, and consequently at that time there were happy presages of auspicious [large-eared] cereals. [But] there happened to be rebellious caitiffs and treasonable rebels, so that [the scheme] was temporarily stopped.

今更名天下田曰“王田”，奴婢曰“私属”，皆不得卖买。
现在将天下的田改名为“王田”，奴婢改名为“私属”，都不准买卖。
Now I change the names of the cultivated fields in the empire to be `the King's fields,' and of male and female slaves to be `private adherents.' All are not to be permitted to be bought or sold.

其男口不盈八，而田过一井者，分余田予九族邻里乡党。

The male and female slaves of the vassal kings [shall be limited to] two hundred persons; those of full marquises and princesses, to a hundred persons; and those of Marquises of the Imperial Domain, officials, and the common people, to thirty persons.

故无田，今当受田者，如制度。
原来没有田，现在应当分得田的，按照制度办理。
Those [slaves] in their sixtieth year and over or in their tenth year and under are not to be counted in this number.

敢有非井田圣制，无法惑众者，投诸四裔，以御魑魅，如皇始祖考虞帝故事。”
敢有反对井田这种圣人制度、无视法律惑乱民众的，流放到四方边远之地，抵御鬼怪，如同伟大的始祖虞帝的旧例。”
No merchants are to be allowed to own private cultivated land or become officials. Those who violate [this order] shall be sentenced according to the Code. Those who [after three years] own private cultivated land or keep male or female slaves more than the [allowed] number, shall all have them confiscated and delivered over the imperial government."


是时，百姓便安汉五铢钱，以莽钱大小两行难知，又数变改不信，皆私以五铢钱市买。
这时，百姓习惯于使用汉朝的五铢钱，因为王莽的钱有大小两种，难以辨认，又多次变更，不可信，都私下用五铢钱交易。
At this time, the people had considered the Han [dynasty's] five-shu cash convenient, and, because Wang Mang's cash coins had been put out in two [denominations], large and small, and so were difficult to tell [apart], and moreover had been changed and altered several times, so that they were not to be trusted, [therefore the people] all privately used the five-shu cash at the market and in purchases,

讹言大钱当罢，莫肯挟。
谣传大钱将要废除，没有人愿意携带。
saying falsely that the large cash are due to be abolished and that no one is willing to keep them.

莽患之。
王莽对此感到忧虑。
[Wang] Mang was troubled by it

复下书：“诸挟五铢钱，言大钱当罢者，比非井田制，投四裔。”
又下文告：“凡携带五铢钱，说大钱将要废除的，比照反对井田制的罪名，流放到四方边远之地。”
and again issued a written message that all those who hoard five-shu cash and say that the large cash are due to be abolished are similar to those who criticize the ching system of cultivated fields and should be "thrown out to the four frontiers."

于是农商失业，食货俱废，民人至涕泣于市道。
于是农民和商人失业，粮食和货物都无法流通，百姓甚至在街市道路上哭泣。
Thereupon farmers and merchants lost their occupations, food and goods were both rendered useless, and the common people even wept in the marketplaces and highways.

及坐卖买田宅、奴婢，铸钱，自诸侯、卿、大夫至于庶民，抵罪者不可胜数。
至于因买卖田宅、奴婢和私铸钱币而犯罪的，从诸侯、卿大夫到平民，犯罪受罚的不计其数。
Moreover those who were tried for buying or selling fields or residences, male or female slaves, or for casting cash, from the nobles, high ministers, and grandees down to ordinary common people, and who suffered punishment, could not be counted.


秋，遣五威将王奇等十二人班《符命》四十二篇于天下。
秋季，派遣五威将王奇等十二人向全国颁布《符命》四十二篇。
Autumn.

In the autumn, [Wang Mang] sent twelve Generals of the Five Majestic [Principles], Wang Ch'i and others, [each with his five Lieutenant Generals], to publish through the empire the Mandate [of Heaven Given Through] Portents, in 42 fascicles.

德祥五事，符命二十五，福应十二，凡四十二篇。
德祥类五篇，符命类二十五篇，福应类十二篇，共四十二篇。
There were five matters of "Happy Presages of Virtues," twenty-five of "Mandates Through Portents," and twelve of "Responses of Heavenly Favors," forty-two fascicles in all.

其德祥言文、宣之世黄龙见于成纪、新都，高祖考王伯墓门梓柱生枝叶之属。
德祥类说的是汉文帝、汉宣帝时期在成纪、新都出现黄龙，高祖的亡父王伯墓门的梓树柱子长出枝叶之类的事。
[The chapters on] "Happy Presages of Virtues" said that in the reigns of [Emperors] Wen and Hsüan, yellow dragons appeared at Ch'eng-chi and Hsin-tu, that a catalpa pillar at the gate to the grave of the Deceased Eminent Founder [of Wang Mang's clan], King Po, [Wang Sui], had sprouted a branch with leaves, and the like.

符命言井石、金匮之属。
符命类说的是井中出石、金匮之类的事。
[The chapters on] "Mandates Through Portents" spoke of the well, the stone, the metal casket, and the like.

福应言雌鸡化为雄之属。
福应类说的是母鸡变为公鸡之类的事。
[The chapters on] "Responses of Heavenly Favors" spoke of a hen having been metamorphosed into a cock and the like.

其文尔雅依托，皆为作说，大归言莽当代汉有天下云。
这些文章辞句典雅，依托古义，都是编造的说法，大意是说王莽应当代替汉朝统治天下。
The language [of the book] was like the Classics, accorded with them and made use of them in making its interpretations. Its final conclusion was that [Wang] Mang was due to have taken the place of the Han [emperors] and to possess the empire.


总有说之曰：“帝王受命，必有德祥之符瑞，协成五命，申以福应，然后能立巍巍之功，传于子孙，永享无穷之祚。
总括起来说：“帝王接受天命，必定有德行祥瑞的符兆，配合五德的运行，再加上福佑的应验，然后才能建立崇高的功业，传给子孙，永享无穷的福运。
In sum it said, "When lords or kings are to receive the mandate [of Heaven], there inevitably are portents and auspices concerning the presages of the virtues [and powers through whose dominance they rule], which assist and complete the mandate to the five [powers], and make this circumstance known by responses of heavenly favor. Then only can [a dynasty] achieve sublime merit and transmit it to its descendants, who will eternally enjoy boundless prosperity.

故新室之兴也，德祥发于汉三七九世之后。
因此新朝的兴起，德祥出现在汉朝经历二百一十年、九代之后。
Hence, when the Hsin dynasty arose, the happy presages of the virtue [of its power] came forth after the three sevens [of decades] and the nine generations [of emperors] of the Han [dynasty had elapsed].

肇命于新都，受瑞于黄支，开王于威功，定命于子同，成命于巴宕，申福于十二应，天所以保祐新室者深矣，固矣！
在新都受初始之命，在黄支接受祥瑞，在威功开创王业，在子同确定天命，在巴宕完成天命，通过十二种福应重申福佑，上天保佑新朝是多么深厚、多么牢固啊！
The mandate [to the Hsin dynasty] commenced when [Wang Mang was the Marquis of] Hsin-tu and received an auspicious presage from [the state of] Huang-chih. His kingship began [with the stone] at Wu-kung. The mandate was fixed [upon him by the portent from the man of] Tzu-t'ung.The mandate was completed by [the happening] at Tang-[ch'ü] in Pa [Commandery.The gods] expressed their favor by twelve responses, [so that] the method which Heaven has used to [show that it] protects and blesses the Hsin dynasty is indeed deep and indeed substantial.


“武功丹石出于汉氏平帝末年，火德销尽，土德当代，皇天眷然，去汉与新，以丹石始命于皇帝。
“武功县的丹石出现在汉朝平帝末年，火德消亡，土德应当代替，皇天顾念，抛弃汉朝，给予新朝，用丹石首次向皇帝授予天命。
"The red stone at Wu-kung appeared in the last year of Emperor P'ing of the Han dynasty, when the virtue of fire had been completely dissipated and the virtue of earth was due to take the place [of the virtue of fire]. August Heaven was solicitous [on account of this circumstance] and so rejected the Han [dynasty] and gave [His mandate] to the Hsin [dynasty], using the red stone as its first mandate to the Emperor.

皇帝谦让，以摄居之，未当天意，故其秋七月，天重以三能文马。
皇帝谦让，以摄政身份居位，不符合天意，因此那年秋七月，上天又用三台星和文马重申天命。
The Emperor, [Wang Mang, however] humbly refused to accept [this title] and hence occupied [the throne] as regent. [But that action] did not accord with the will of Heaven, hence in that autumn, the seventh month, Heaven again used the varicolored horse of [the constellation] San-t'ai.

皇帝复谦让，未即位，故三以铁契，四以石龟，五以虞符，六以文圭，七以玄印，八以茂陵石书，九以玄龙石，十以神井，十一以大神石，十二以铜符帛图。
皇帝又谦让，没有即位，因此第三次用铁契，第四次用石龟，第五次用虞符，第六次用文圭，第七次用玄印，第八次用茂陵石书，第九次用玄龙石，第十次用神井，第十一次用大神石，第十二次用铜符帛图。
The Emperor, [Wang Mang], again humbly refused, and did not yet ascend the throne, hence [there came] a third [mandate] by an iron contract, a fourth [mandate] by a stone tortoise, a fifth [mandate] by a portent from Yü [Shun], a sixth [mandate] by an inscribed sceptre, a seventh [mandate] by a black seal, an eighth [mandate] by a stone message at Mou-ling, a ninth [mandate] by a dark dragon stone, a tenth [mandate] by a supernatural well, an eleventh [mandate] by a great supernatural stone, and a twelfth [mandate] by a copper portent and a design on silk.

申命之瑞，浸以显著，至于十二，以昭告新皇帝。
重申天命的祥瑞，逐渐显著，直到十二次，以明确告示新皇帝。
The happy presages which expressed the mandate [of Heaven] gradually became [more and more] outstanding until they reached [the number of] twelve, in order to announce plainly that the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty should ascend the throne].


皇帝深惟上天之威不可不畏，故去摄号，犹尚称假，改元为初始，欲以承塞天命，克厌上帝之心。
皇帝深知上天的威严不可不畏，因此去掉摄政称号，仍称假皇帝，改年号为初始，想以此承应天命，满足上天的心意。
The Emperor pondered deeply that the majesty of Heaven Above could not but be feared. Hence he did away with the title of Regent, yet still called himself the Acting [Emperor], and changed the year-period to Ch'u-shih, intending thereby to stop the mandate of Heaven and yet to carry out and satisfy the will of the Lords on High.

然非皇天所以郑重降符命之意，故是日天复决以龟书。
但这不符合皇天郑重降下符命的本意，因此当天上天又用龟书作出决断。
Yet that was not the purpose for which August Heaven had so carefully sent down his mandate through portents. Hence on that [very] day Heaven again settled [his hesitancy] by a tortoise letter.

有侍郎王盱见人衣白布单衣，赤缋方领，冠小冠，立于王路殿前，谓盱曰：“今日天同色，以天下人民属皇帝。”
有侍郎王盱看见一个人穿着白布单衣，红色绣边的方领，戴着小帽子，站在王路殿前，对王盱说：“今天天地同色，把天下人民托付给皇帝。”
A Gentleman-in-attendance, Wang Hsü, moreover saw a man clothed in a white plain cloth thin garment with a square collar of red ribbon, wearing on his head the small bonnet, standing in front of the Hall With the Royal Apartments. He said to [Wang] Hsü, `Today, in heaven [everyone] is of the same mind to confide the people of the world to [Wang Mang] as Emperor.'

盱怪之，行十余步，人忽不见。
王盱感到奇怪，走了十多步，那人忽然不见了。
While [Wang] Hsü was marvelling at it and walked more than ten double-paces, the man was suddenly not seen.


其夕，岁星入太微，Fill荧惑。
当天傍晚，岁星进入太微星座，遮掩了荧惑星。
On the evening of [the day] ping-yin, at the Temple of [Emperor] Kao of the Han dynasty, there was a metal casket with a design and a charter, [stating that] Emperor Kao had received the mandate of Heaven to transmit the state to the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty].

有金策书，高帝神令以国传新皇帝。
出现金策书，高帝的神灵命令把国家传给新皇帝。
The next morning, the Elder of the Imperial House, the Marquis of Loyalty and Filial Piety, Liu Hung, reported it.

明旦，宗伯忠孝侯刘宏以闻。
第二天早晨，宗伯忠孝侯刘宏将此事上报。
Thereupon the ministers were summoned to discuss it.

乃召公卿议，未决，而大神石人谈曰：“趣新皇帝之高庙受命。
于是召集公卿商议，还未决定，大神石人发话道：“赶快让新皇帝到高庙接受天命。
When they had not yet reached a decision, the great supernatural stone man spoke, saying, `Hasten the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty] to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, [where he is] to receive the Mandate.

毋留！”
不要拖延！”
Do not delay.'


于是新皇帝立登车，之汉氏高庙受命，受命之日，丁卯也。
于是新皇帝立即上车，前往汉朝高庙接受天命，接受天命的日子是丁卯日。
Thereupon the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty, Wang Mang], at once mounted his chariot and went to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao of the Han dynasty and received the mandate. The day of receiving the mandate was ting-mao.

丁，火，汉氏之德也。
丁属火，是汉朝的德运。
Ting is fire, which is the virtue of the Han dynasty;

卯，刘姓所以为字也。
卯，是构成刘字的一部分。
mao is that whereby the [Han dynasty's] surname, Liu, becomes this written character.

明汉刘火德尽，而传于新室也。
表明汉朝刘氏的火德已尽，政权传给新朝。
It makes plain that the virtue of fire, [which was that of] the Han [dynasty] and of the Liu [clan], is exhausted, and that [the state] has been transmitted to the house of Hsin.


皇帝谦谦，既备固让，十二符应迫著，命不可辞，惧然祗畏，苇然闵汉氏之终不可济，亹亹左右之不得从意，为之三夜不御寝，三日不御食。
皇帝谦逊，已多次坚决辞让，但十二种符应紧迫明显，天命不可推辞，心怀敬畏，哀怜汉朝终究无法挽救，勤勉操劳而不能顺遂心意，为此三夜没有睡觉，三天没有吃饭。
Since the Emperor was perfect in `humility,' he renounced firmly [the honors indicated by] the twelve responses [from the gods] by portents, [but] he was compelled by the plain mandate [of Heaven] and could not refuse. He was startled and reverently awed, and worried and sad that the ending of the Han dynasty could not have been arrested. He was indefatigable in assisting [the Han dynasty, but] he could not carry out his purposes, and, because of that, for three nights he did not go to his bed and for three days he did not touch food.

延问公侯卿大夫，佥曰：“宜奉如上天威命。”
召见询问公侯卿大夫，都说：“应当遵照上天的威严命令。”
He invited and questioned the highest ministers, marquises, high ministers, and grandees, and all said, `It is proper that you should receive [the rule] according to the majestic mandate of Heaven Above.'

于是乃改元定号，海内更始。
于是改年号，定国号，全国更新。
Thereupon he changed the year-period, fixed upon his title, and [gave the opportunity for] a new beginning to [all] within [the four] seas.

新室既定，神祗欢喜，申以福应，吉瑞累仍。
新朝建立后，神灵欢喜，用福佑应验重申，吉祥瑞兆接连不断。
When the House of Hsin had been fixed [upon the throne], the gods in heaven and earth were glad and rejoiced, and emphasized it by responses of [celestial] favor. Their fortunate presages were continuous and reiterated.

《诗》曰：“宜民宜人，受禄于天；保右命之，自天申之。”
《诗经》说：“使民众安宁，受天福禄；上天保佑，重申天命。”
The Book of Odes says,

When [the sovereign] orders aright his people and orders aright his officers,

He receives blessings from Heaven,

Who protects and aids him and gives him his mandate.

By [this mandate] from Heaven he issues his imperial mandates — which refers to the present case."
这说的就是现在的情形。”


五威将奉《符命》，赍印绶，王侯以下及吏官名更者，外及匈奴、西域，徼外蛮夷，皆即授新室印绶，因收故汉印绶。
五威将恭敬地捧着《符命》，携带印信绶带，对王侯以下及更改官名的官吏，以及塞外的匈奴、西域和边境以外的蛮夷，都就地授予新朝的印信绶带，同时收回原来汉朝的印信绶带。
The Generals of the Five Majestic [Principles], in respectful obedience to the mandate [given by] portents, brought seals and cords and gave them to the kings, the marquises, and those of lower [rank], down to the lower officials whose official titles had been changed, and, outside [the country], to the Huns, to the Western Frontier Regions, and to the barbarians outside the borders.

The Generals of the Five Majestic [Principles] and their Lieutenants, 72 persons [in all], returned and memorialized their reports. The vassal kings of the Han [dynasty] who had become Dukes had all given up their kingly seals and cords, had become common people, and none had disobeyed [Wang Mang's] commands.

封将为子，帅为男。
封五威将为子爵，五威帅为男爵。
[Wang Mang] enfeoffed the Generals as Viscounts and the Lieutenants as Barons.


初设六管之令。
开始设立六管的法令。
The ordinances for the six monopolies [lit., "controls"] were first established.

命县官酤酒，卖盐铁器，铸钱，诸采取名山大泽众物者税之。

A prohibition was made that the common people were not allowed to possess crossbows or cuirasses. [Those who violated this prohibition] were to be exiled to Hsi-hai [Commandery].


匈奴单于求故玺，莽不与，遂寇边郡，杀略吏民。
匈奴单于请求归还原来的印信，王莽不给，单于于是侵犯边境各郡，杀戮掳掠官吏和平民。
When the Hun Shan-yü's [envoy, who had come to the imperial capital,] had asked for [the Shan-yü's] former imperial seal, [Wang] Mang had not given it to him, consequently [the Huns had] raided the border commanderies, killing and kidnapping officials and common people.


十一月，立国将军建奏：“西域将钦上言，九月辛已，戊己校尉中陈良、终带共贼杀校尉刁护，劫略吏士，自称废汉大将军，亡入匈奴。
十一月，立国将军孙建奏报：“西域将但钦上报，九月辛巳日，戊己校尉的属官陈良、终带共同杀死校尉刁护，胁迫官吏士兵，自称废汉大将军，逃入匈奴。
In the eleventh month, the General Establishing the State, [Sun] Chien, memorialized, "A general in the Western Frontier Regions, [Tan] Ch'in, has sent [to the court a message] which says, `In the ninth month, on [the day] hsin-szu, Ch'en Lang and Chung Tai, officials of the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, joined together, murdered their Colonel, Tiao Hu, and coerced officials and soldiers, calling themselves Generalissimos of the fallen Han [dynasty], and fled to the Huns.'

又今月癸酉，不知何一男子遮臣建车前，自称‘汉氏刘子舆，成帝下妻子也。刘氏当复，趣空宫。’
又本月癸酉日，不知哪个男子拦在我孙建的车前，自称‘汉朝刘子舆，是成帝的卑贱宫女所生的儿子。刘氏应当复兴，赶快空出皇宫。’
"Moreover in the present month, on [the day] kuei-ch'ou, a man of unknown provenance obstructed the front of your servant Chien's chariot, calling himself Liu Tzu-yü of the House of Han, a son of Emperor Ch'eng by a low-[class] wife, [saying that] the Liu clan is due to be restored and that the palaces should quickly be emptied.

收系男子，即常安姓武字仲。
拘捕这个男子，原来是常安人，姓武，字仲。
I arrested and bound the man, and he was [found to be a man of] Ch'ang-an, surnamed Wu, with the courtesy name Chung.

皆逆天违命，大逆无道。请论仲及陈良等亲属当坐者。
这些人都违背天命，大逆无道。请求判处武仲以及陈良等人的亲属中应当连坐的人。
"All of them have gone contrary to Heaven and disobeyed His mandate, which is treason and inhumanity. I beg that you will pass sentence upon [Wu] Chung, together with [Ch'en] Liang and the others, and upon their blood relatives and relatives by marriage who are due to be sentenced with them."

奏可。
奏请得到批准。
The memorial was approved.


汉氏高皇帝比著戒云，罢吏卒，为宾食，诚欲承天心，全子孙也。
汉朝高皇帝多次明确告诫说，要解散官吏士兵，作为宾客享受供奉，的确是想顺从天意，保全子孙。
[He also memorialized], "Emperor Kao of the Han dynasty frequently made known a warning saying, `Dismiss the officials and soldiers [in the Han Ancestral Temples] and make [the Han emperors] guests at the sacrifice [in the temples of the present dynasty],' sincerely desiring to accord with the will of Heaven and to preserve his descendants.

其宗庙不当在常安城中，及诸刘为诸侯者当与汉俱废。
汉朝的宗庙不应当留在常安城中，以及各刘姓皇族担任诸侯的应当随着汉朝一同被废除。
His ancestral temple ought not to be inside the city-walls of Ch'ang-an, and, together with the [members of] the Liu [clan] who are nobles, they should all have been dismissed at the same time that the Han [dynasty was overthrown].

陛下至仁，久未定。
陛下非常仁慈，很久没有作出决定。
Your Majesty is most benevolent and for this long time has not settled [this matter].

前故安众侯刘崇、徐乡侯刘快、陵乡侯刘曾、扶恩侯刘贵等更聚众谋反。
从前原安众侯刘崇、徐乡侯刘快、陵乡侯刘曾、扶恩侯刘贵等人接连聚集众人谋反。
"Previously, the former Marquis of An-chung, Liu Ch'ung, the [former] Marquis of Hsü-hsiang, Liu K'uai, the [former] Marquis of Ling-hsiang, Liu Ts'eng, and the [former] Marquis of Fu-ên, Liu Kuei, and others, one by one collected a crowd and plotted to rebel.

今狂狡之虏或妄自称亡汉将军，或称成帝子子舆，至犯夷灭，连未止者，此圣恩不蚤绝其萌牙故也。
现在狂妄狡猾的贼人有的妄自称亡汉将军，有的称是成帝的儿子子舆，直到犯下被诛灭宗族的罪行，接连不断，这是因为陛下的圣恩没有及早断绝他们的萌芽的缘故。
Now some perverse and treacherous caitiffs have falsely called themselves generals of the fallen Han [dynasty] and one person has called himself [Liu] Tzu-yü, a son of Emperor Ch'eng, so that they have committed [crimes punishable by] being executed and their relatives being annihilated. The reason that these continual [rebellions] have not stopped is that your sage grace has not sooner cut off the early growths [of such events].

芳愚以为汉高皇帝为新室宾，享食明堂。
我愚昧地认为汉高皇帝应当作为新朝的宾客，在明堂享受祭祀。
"Your servant stupidly considers that Emperor Kao of the Han [dynasty] should become a guest of the House of Hsin and enjoy sacrifices in the Ming-t'ang.

成帝，异姓之兄弟；平帝，婿也；皆不宜复入其庙。
成帝，是异姓的兄弟；平帝，是女婿；都不应当再进入他们的祠庙。
Emperor Ch'eng was your cousin with a different surname and Emperor P'ing was your son-in-law. For all of them it is not proper that they should again enter their temples.

元帝与皇太后为体，圣恩所隆，礼亦宜之。
元帝与皇太后是夫妇一体，陛下的圣恩所尊崇的，按礼制也适合那样对待。
Emperor Yüan became of one flesh with the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], and the rites by which your sage grace has exalted her are appropriate also for him.

臣请汉氏诸庙在京师者皆罢。
我请求将汉朝在京城的各祠庙全部废除。
"Your servant begs that the various temples of the Han dynasty in the imperial capital should all be abolished,

诸刘为诸侯者，以户多少就五等之差；其为吏者皆罢，待除于家。
各刘姓皇族担任诸侯的，根据封户多少归入五等爵位的等级；那些担任官吏的都予以罢免，在家等待任命。
that the various [members of] the Liu [clan] who are nobles should be put into the hierarchy of five degrees [of nobility] in accordance with the number of households [in their estates], and that those [members of the Liu clan] who are officials should all be dismissed and await new appointments at their homes.

上当天心，称高皇帝神灵，塞狂狡之萌。”
上以顺应天意，符合高皇帝的神灵，堵塞狂妄狡猾之徒的萌芽。”
On the one hand, [this procedure] will accord with the will of Heaven and agree with the supernatural manifestations from Emperor Kao, and [on the other hand], it will stop the beginnings of perverseness and treachery."


莽曰：“可。
王莽说：“可以。
[Wang] Mang said [in his message], "It may be done.

嘉新公国师以符命为予四辅，明务侯刘龚、率礼侯刘嘉等凡三十二人皆知天命，
嘉新公国师因符命担任我的四辅，明务侯刘龚、率礼侯刘嘉等共三十二人都知晓天命，
The Duke Honoring the Hsin [Dynasty], the State Master, [Liu Hsin], who, because of the mandate [given by] portents, has been made [one of] my Four Coadjutors, the Marquis of Brilliant Virtues, Liu Kung, the Marquis Leading by the Rules of Proper Conduct, Liu Chia" and others, "thirty-two persons in all, all understood the mandate of Heaven;

或献天符，或贡昌言，或捕告反虏，厥功茂焉。
有的进献天符，有的献上善言，有的拘捕告发反贼，他们的功劳很大。
they either presented portents from Heaven or offered congratulatory sayings or arrested or informed upon rebellious caitiffs, so that their merits are abundant.

诸刘与三十二人同宗共祖者勿罢，赐姓曰王。”
各刘姓皇族中与这三十二人同宗共祖的不罢免，赐姓王。”
The [members of] the Liu [clan] who are of the same clan and have the same grandfathers as these thirty-two persons are not to be dismissed and are to be granted the [imperial] surname, Wang."


唯国师以女配莽子，故不赐姓。
衹有国师因女儿嫁给了王莽的儿子，所以不赐姓。
Only the State Teacher, [Liu Hsin], was not granted this surname, because his daughter had been married to [Wang] Mang's son.

改定安太后号曰“黄皇室主”，绝之于汉也。
改定安太后的称号为“黄皇室主”，与汉朝断绝关系。
The title of the Duchess Dowager of Established Tranquillity, [Wang Mang's daughter], was changed, and she was called the Princess of the Yellow Imperial House, in order to cut her off from the [house of] Han.


冬十二月，雷。
冬季十二月，打雷。
In the winter, the twelfth month, it thundered.


更名匈奴单于曰“降奴服于。”
改匈奴单于的称号为“降奴服于”。
The title of the Shan-yü of the Huns (Hsiung-nu) was changed, and he was called the Submitted Capture (Fu-yü) of the Surrendered Slaves (Hsiang-nu).


莽曰：“降奴服于知威侮五行，背畔四条，侵犯西域，延及边垂，为元元害，罪当夷灭。
王莽说：“降奴服于囊知牙斯冒犯五行，背叛四条协议，侵犯西域，蔓延到边境，危害百姓，罪行应当诛灭宗族。
[Wang] Mang said [in a message], "The Submitted Capture of the Surrendered Slaves, [Lüan-ti] Chih, has `despised and insulted the five powers,' has turned his back upon and rebelled against the four articles, has invaded and violated the Western Frontier Regions, and has extended himself to and reached the frontiers [of China], where he has made himself injurious to the great multitude. His crimes are such that he ought to be executed and his relatives annihilated.

命遣立国将军孙建等凡十二将，十道并出，共行皇天之威，罚于知之身。
命令派遣立国将军孙建等共十二位将领，分十路同时出击，共同行使皇天的威严，惩罚囊知牙斯本人。
I command and send the General Establishing the State, Sun Chien," and others, "twelve generals [in all], to go out simultaneously by ten routes, and respectfully perform the majestic punishment of August Heaven upon the person of [Lüan-ti] Chih.

惟知先祖故呼韩邪单于稽侯犭册累世忠孝，保塞守徼，不忍以一知之罪，灭稽侯犭册之世。
想到囊知牙斯的先祖原呼韩邪单于稽侯狦世代忠孝，保卫边塞，驻守边疆，不忍心因为囊知牙斯一人的罪行，灭绝稽侯狦的后代。
But I ponder that the ancestor of [Lüan-ti] Chih, the former Shan-yü Hu-han-hsieh, [Lüan-ti] Chi-hou-shan, was loyal and filial during successive reigns, protecting the barriers and guarding the frontiers. I cannot bear, because of the crime of one [Lüan-ti] Chih, to destroy the posterity of [Lüan-ti] Chi-hou-shan.

今分匈奴国土人民以为十五，立稽侯犭册子孙十五人为单于。
现在将匈奴的土地和人民分为十五部分，立稽侯狦的十五个子孙为单于。
Now I divide the state, territory, and people of the Huns and make of it fifteen [states], setting up fifteen descendants of [Lüan-ti] Chi-hou-shan as Shan-yü."


遣中郎将蔺苞、戴级驰塞下，召拜当为单于者。
派遣中郎将蔺苞、戴级快速前往边塞，召集并任命应当成为单于的人。
He sent a General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Lin Pao, [with] Tai Chi, to gallop just outside the barrier, summon, and install those who ought to become Shan-yü.

诸匈奴人当坐虏知之法者，皆赦除之”。
各匈奴人中因囊知牙斯而应当连坐受罚的，都予以赦免。
Those people of the Huns who ought to be sentenced because of the law [against] the caitiff [Lüan-ti] Chih were all [granted] amnesty and set free.

使者驰传督趣，以军兴法从事，天下骚动。

Those who arrived first encamped in the border commanderies, waiting for them all to arrive, and then go out at the same time.


莽以钱币讫不行，复下书曰：“民以食为命，以货为资，是以八政以食为首。
王莽因钱币始终不能流通，又下文告说：“百姓以粮食为命脉，以财物为资本，因此八项施政方针以粮食为首。
Because his cash and [other] currencies finally did not circulate, [Wang Mang] again issued a written message, which said, "The common people consider their food as their life and their goods as their wealth. For this reason among the eight [objects of] government, food is given the first place.

宝货皆重则小用不给，皆轻则僦载烦费，轻重大小各有差品，则用便而民乐。”
货币都贵重，小额交易就不便；都轻贱，运输就麻烦费钱；轻重大小各有等级，使用就方便，百姓就欢喜。”
If the valuable currency is all of large [denominations], when one needs a small amount [of money], it is not available; if it is all of small [denominations], then transporting it is troublesome and expensive; if large and small [denominations], big and little [coins], are each of different kinds, then their use is convenient and the common people rejoice."

于是造宝货五品，语在《食货志》。
于是制造五种货币，这些记载在《食货志》中。
Therefore [Wang Mang] created valuable currency of five kinds. A discussion is in the "Treatise on Food and Goods."

百姓不从，但行小大钱二品而已。
百姓不依从，衹通行大小钱两种而已。
The people did not accord, and only used merely two denominations of cash, the large and the diminutive [cash].

盗铸钱者不可禁，乃重其法，一家铸钱，五家坐之，没入为奴婢。
私自铸钱的无法禁止，于是加重刑罚，一家铸钱，五家连坐，没收为奴婢。
Since those who cast counterfeit cash could not be stopped, [Wang Mang] made the penalties [against counterfeiting] heavy. When one family cast cash, the five [neighboring] families were to be sentenced for it, [their property was to be] confiscated, and they were to be enslaved.


吏民出入，持布钱以副符传，不持者，厨传勿舍，关津苛留。
官吏百姓出入，要携带布钱作为符传的副证，不携带的，馆舍不让住宿，关卡渡口予以盘问扣留。
When officials and common people went in or out [the barriers], they were to carry spade-money as an adjunct to their passport credentials. For those who did not carry [spade-money], the [post]-kitchens and relay stations were not to house them, and at the barriers and fords they were to be investigated and detained.

公卿皆持以入宫殿门，欲以重而行之。
公卿都要携带它才能进入宫殿门，想用这种办法提高它的身价从而得以流通。
The ministers were all to hold them when they entered the gates of the palaces and halls. The intention was to make them valuable and circulate.


是时，争为符命封侯，其不为者相戏曰：“独无天帝除书乎？”
这时，人们争着制作符命以求封侯，那些没有制作的人互相开玩笑说：“难道衹有你没有天帝的任命书吗？”
At this time, [many persons] strove to make mandates [from Heaven by means of] portents in order to be enfeoffed as marquises. Those who did not make them, made sport, saying, "Were we alone without letters of appointment from the Lord of Heaven?"

司命陈崇白莽曰：“此开奸臣作福之路而乱天命，宜绝其原。”
司命陈崇向王莽报告说：“这是打开了奸臣谋私利的门路，扰乱天命，应当断绝这个根源。”
A Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], Ch'en Ch'ung, advised [Wang] Mang of it, saying, "This [matter] is opening the way for wicked `subjects to confer [kingly] favors [upon themselves],' and to bring confusion upon the mandate of Heaven. It would be proper to cut away its source."

莽亦厌之，遂使尚书大夫赵并验治，非五威将率所班，皆下狱。
王莽也厌烦了这种事，于是派尚书大夫赵并查验处理，凡不是五威将帅所颁布的符命，制作的人都关进监狱。
[Wang] Mang also had had his fill of it, and thereupon had a Grandee Master of Writing, Chao Ping, investigate and try [such offenders]. Those who [made known portents] which were not those published by the Generals and Lieutenants of the Five Majestic [Principles] were all sent to prison.


初，甄丰、刘歆、王舜为莽腹心，倡导在位，褒扬功德；“安汉”、“宰衡”之号及封莽母、两子、兄子，皆丰等所共谋，而丰、舜、歆亦受其赐，并富贵矣，非复欲令莽居摄也。
起初，甄丰、刘歆、王舜是王莽的心腹，在朝中倡导，褒扬王莽的功德；“安汉公”、“宰衡”的称号以及封王莽的母亲、两个儿子和侄子，都是甄丰等人共同策划的，而甄丰、王舜、刘歆也得到赏赐，都富贵了，不再想让王莽居位摄政。
Previously, Chen Feng, Liu Hsin, and Wang Shun had been [Wang] Mang's intimate advisors and had led those who were in office in making known [Wang Mang's] achievements and virtuous conduct for rewards. His titles of [Duke] Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty] and Ruling Governor, together with the enfeoffment of [Wang] Mang's mother and his two sons and a nephew, were all planned by [Chen] Feng together with the others. [Chen] Feng, [Wang] Shun, and [Liu] Hsin had moreover received grants from him and had all become indeed wealthy and honorable.

They did not in addition want to bring it about that [Wang] Mang should become Regent.

居摄之萌，出于泉陵侯刘庆、前煇光谢嚣、长安令田终术。
居位摄政的发端，出自泉陵侯刘庆、前辉光谢嚣、长安令田终术。
The first beginnings of his becoming the Regent came from the Marquis of Ch'üan-ling, Liu Ch'ing, the Displayer of Splendor in the South, Hsieh Hsiao, and the Prefect of Ch'ang-an, T'ien Chung-shu.


莽羽翼已成，意欲称摄。
王莽的势力已经形成，想要称摄皇帝。
When [Wang] Mang's wings had grown and he desired to be entitled Regent,

丰等承顺其意，莽辄复封舜、歆两子及丰孙。
甄丰等人顺从他的意图，王莽就又封赏王舜、刘歆的两个儿子以及甄丰的孙子。
[Chen] Feng and the others accepted and agreed with his intentions. [Wang] Mang immediately enfeoffed in addition the two sons of [Wang] Shun and of [Liu] Hsin, together with [Chen] Feng's grandson.

丰等爵位已盛，心意既满，又实畏汉宗室、天下豪桀。
甄丰等人爵位已经很高，欲望已经满足，又实在害怕汉朝宗室和天下豪杰。
When the noble rank and official position of [Chen] Feng and the others had been received, their ambitions were satisfied. They moreover really feared the Han imperial house and the prominent persons in the empire.

而疏远欲进者，并作符命，莽遂据以即真，舜、歆内惧而已。
而关系疏远想要向上爬的人，纷纷制作符命，王莽于是依靠这些登上真皇帝位，王舜、刘歆内心恐惧而已。
But those who had been distant from [Wang Mang] and wanted to advance, simultaneously made mandates [from Heaven given through] portents. When [Wang] Mang thereupon employed them in order to ascend [the throne as] the actual [Emperor, Wang] Shun and [Liu] Hsin merely became inwardly fearful.

丰素刚强，莽觉其不说，故徙大阿、右拂、大司空丰、托符命文，为更始将军，与卖饼儿王盛同列。
甄丰一向刚强，王莽察觉他不高兴，所以调他任大阿、右拂、大司空，藉符命文辞，任命为更始将军，与卖饼儿王盛地位相同。
[Chen] Feng was ordinarily resolute, [so Wang] Mang became conscious that [Chen Feng] was not pleased. Hence [Wang Mang] removed him from being Grand Support Aiding on the Right and Grand Minister of Works, and, taking advantage of a writing on a mandate by a portent, he made him the General of a New Beginning, ranking him the same as the seller of cakes, Wang Sheng.

丰父子默默。
甄丰父子沉默不语。
[Chen] Feng and his son kept silent [but were dissatisfied].

时子寻为侍中京兆大君茂德侯，即作符命，言新室当分陕，立二伯，以丰为右伯，太傅平晏为左伯，如周、召故事。
当时甄丰的儿子甄寻担任侍中京兆大君茂德侯，就制作符命，说新朝应当划分陕地，设立二伯，以甄丰为右伯，太傅平晏为左伯，仿照周公、召公的旧例。
At this time, [Chen Feng's] son, [Chen] Hsün, was a Palace Attendant, Grand Governor of the Capital, and Marquis of Abundant Virtues. He now made a mandate [from Heaven by means of a] portent, saying that the House of Hsin ought to divide [its territory at] Shan and set up two Chiefs [to govern that territory], making [Chen] Feng the Western Chief and the Grand Tutor, and P'ing Yen, the Eastern Chief, as in the former circumstances [was done for the Dukes of] Chou and of Shao.


莽即从之，拜丰为右伯。
王莽立即依从了，任命甄丰为右伯。
[Wang] Mang thereupon followed this [mandate] and installed [Chen] Feng as the Western Chief.

当述职西出，未行，寻复作符命，言故汉氏平帝后黄皇室主为寻之妻。
正要按照职责西行，还没出发，甄寻又制作符命，说原汉朝平帝的皇后黄皇室主是甄寻的妻子。
[Chen] Feng was to "report on his duties" and go out to the west, but had not yet gone, when [Chen] Hsün again made a mandate [from Heaven by means of] a portent, which said that the Empress [nee Wang] of the former Emperor P'ing of the Han clan, the Princess of the Yellow Imperial House, was [to be] the wife of [Chen] Hsün.


莽以诈立，心疑大臣怨谤，欲震威以惧下，因是发怒曰：“黄皇室主天下母，此何谓也！”
王莽靠欺诈登上皇位，心中怀疑大臣怨恨诽谤，想显示威严来震慑臣下，藉此发怒说：“黄皇室主是天下人的母亲，这话是什么意思！”
[Wang] Mang had been set [on the throne] by fraud, so he suspected in his heart that his great officials would hate and malign him. He wanted to terrify them in order to make his inferiors fear him. Because of these [feelings], he burst out in anger and said, "The Princess of the Yellow Imperial House is a mother of the empire. What means this [statement] [about her becoming the wife of Chen Hsün]?"

收捕寻。
拘捕甄寻。
He [ordered Chen] Hsün arrested.

寻亡，丰自杀。
甄寻逃跑，甄丰自杀。
[Chen] Hsün fled and [Chen] Feng committed suicide.


寻随方士入华山，岁余捕得，辞连国师公歆子侍中东通灵将、五司大夫隆威侯棻，棻弟右曹长水校尉伐虏侯泳，大司空邑弟左关将军掌威侯奇，及歆门人侍中骑都尉丁隆等，牵引公卿党亲列侯以下，死者数百人。
甄寻跟着方士进入华山，一年多后被捕获，供词牵连到国师公刘歆的儿子侍中东通灵将、五司大夫隆威侯刘棻，刘棻的弟弟右曹长水校尉伐虏侯刘泳，大司空王邑的弟弟左关将军掌威侯王奇，以及刘歆的弟子侍中骑都尉丁隆等，牵连到公卿、党羽、亲属、列侯以下，死的有几百人。
[Chen] Hsün followed a gentleman versed in the magical arts and entered [the solitudes of] Mt. Hua. After more than a year he was siezed. His confession implicated [1] the Palace Attendant, Supernaturally [Influencing] General [Whose Influence] Penetrates Eastwards, Grandee in Charge of the Five Behaviors, and Marquis Prospering the Majestic [Principles], Liu Fen, the son of the State Master and Duke, [Liu] Hsin, [2] Liu Fen's younger brother, the Senior Department Head, Colonel of the Ch'ang River [Encampments], and Marquis Attacking Caitiffs, [Liu] Yung, [3] the General of the Eastern Passes [for the Five Majestic Principles] and Marquis Grasping the Majestic Principles, [Wang] Ch'i, the younger brother of the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang] Yi, together with [4] a disciple of Liu Hsin, the Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Ting Lung, and others. They involved ministers, their cabals, and their relatives. The full marquises and those [ranking] lower who died were numbered by the hundreds.


寻手理有“天子”二字，莽解其臂入视之，曰：“此一大子也，或曰一六子也。六者，戮也。明寻父子当戮死也。”
甄寻手掌的纹理有“天子”二字，王莽拆开他的手臂进去查看，说：“这是‘一大子’，或称‘一六子’。六，就是戮，表明甄寻父子应当被处死。”
In the lines of [Chen] Hsün's hands there were the words, "Son of Heaven." [Wang] Mang had his arms untied, had him enter [the palace], and looked at [his hands]. He said, "These [words] are `one big fellow.' " Some one said, "[It is] `one lu fellow.' `Lu' is to put to death. It makes plain that [Chen Feng and Chen] Hsün, father and son, must be put to death and die."

乃流棻于幽州，放寻于三危，殛隆于羽山，皆驿车载其尸传致云。
于是把刘棻流放到幽州，把甄寻驱逐到三危，把丁隆杀死在羽山，都用驿车运送他们的尸体到目的地。
Thereupon [Wang Mang] executed and banished [Liu] Fen to Yu Province, executed and expelled [(Wang) Ch'i to Mt. Ch'ung, executed and drove away Chen] Hsün to [Mt.] San-wei, and executed and killed [Ting] Lung on Mt. Yü. The corpses of all were transported in post-chariots to their destinations.


莽为人侈口蹶顄，露眼赤精，大声而嘶。
王莽嘴巴宽大，下巴突出，眼球突出，眼珠发红，声音粗大而沙哑。
As a man, [Wang] Mang had a large mouth and a receding chin, bulging eyes with brilliant pupils, and a loud voice which was hoarse.

长七尺五寸，好厚履高冠，以氂装衣，反膺高视，瞰临左右。
身高七尺五寸，喜欢穿厚底鞋、戴高帽子，用硬毛絮衣，挺胸仰视，居高临下地看着周围的人。
He was seven feet five inches tall, loved thick-[soled] shoes and tall bonnets, and used clothes padded with felt. He stuck out his chest and made himself look tall, [so that he could] look down on those who were around him.


是时，有用方技待诏黄门者，或问以莽形貌，待诏曰：“莽所谓鸱目虎吻豺狼之声者也，故能食人，亦当为人所食。”
这时，有个凭借方术在黄门待诏的人，有人问他王莽的相貌，待诏说：“王莽是所说的猫头鹰眼睛、老虎嘴巴、豺狼声音的人，所以能吃人，也会被人吃掉。”
At this time, there was a person skilled in medical and allied arts who was an Expectant Appointee at the Yellow Gate. Someone asked him about [Wang] Mang's figure and countenance, and the Expectant Appointee replied, "[Wang] Mang is a person who may be said to have owl's eyes, tiger's jaws, and a wolf's voice. Hence he is able to eat people and is also due to be eaten by people."

问者告之，莽诛灭待诏，而封告者。
问话的人把这话告诉了王莽，王莽处死了待诏并灭了他的族，封赏了告发的人。
The person who questioned him gave information about [his reply, and Wang] Mang exterminated the Expectant Appointee [and his relatives] and enfeoffed the informer.

后常翳云母屏面，非亲近莫得见也。
后来王莽常用云母屏风遮挡面容，不是亲近的人不能见到他。

三年，莽曰：“百官改更，职事分移，律令仪法，未及悉定，且因汉律令仪法以从事。
三年，王莽说：“百官的名称有变更，职务有变动，法律制度和礼仪规则，还没来得及全部确定，暂且依照汉朝的法律制度和礼仪规则处理事务。
In the third year, [Wang] Mang said, "The many offices have been changed and altered and their duties have been redistributed, but the code, ordinances, ceremonies, and laws have not yet been all determined upon, [hence] temporarily the Han [dynasty's] code, ordinances, ceremonies, and laws should be followed and applied in [government] business."

令公卿、大夫、诸侯、二千石举吏民有德行通政事能言语明文学者各一人，诣王路四门。”
命令公卿、大夫、诸侯、二千石级官吏各举荐一名有德行、通晓政事、擅长言辞、明习文献典籍的官吏或平民，前往王路四门。”

[Such] persons were to go to the [Directors of] the Four Gates to the Royal Apartments."


遣尚书大夫赵并使劳北边，还言五原北假膏壤殖谷，异时常置田官。
派遣尚书大夫赵并出使慰劳北方边境，回来报告说五原郡北假地区土壤肥沃，适合种植谷物，从前常设置管理农田的官吏。
[Wang Mang] sent the Grandee Master of Writing, Chao Ping, to bring encouragement to the northern borders. He returned and said that in Po-chia of Wu-yüan [Commandery the soil] is fertile and produces grain, and that at other times offices for cultivated fields had regularly been established there.

乃以并为田禾将军，以戍卒屯田北假，以助军粮。
于是任命赵并为田禾将军，让戍卒在北假屯田，以补充军粮。
Thereupon [Wang Mang] made [Chao] Ping the General of Cultivated Fields and Grain to send frontier troops to garrison farms in Po-chia, in order to assist the army with provisions.


是时，诸将在边，须大众集，吏士放纵，而内郡愁于征发，民弃城郭流亡为盗贼，并州、平州尤甚。
这时，各将领在边境，等待大军集结，官兵放纵妄为，而内地各郡因征发人力物力而愁苦，百姓抛弃城邑流亡成为盗贼，并州、平州尤其严重。
At that time, while the various generals who were at the border were waiting for the large bands [of soldiers] to be collected, their officers and soldiers did as they pleased, while the inner commanderies were troubled with levying [troops] and collecting [materials]. The common people left the cities and suburbs and became vagrants, becoming thieves and robbers. In Ping Province they were especially numerous.

莽令七公六卿号皆兼称将军，遣著武将军逮并等填名都，中郎将、绣衣执法各五十五人，分填缘边大郡，督大奸猾擅弄兵者，皆便为奸于外，挠乱州郡，货赂为市，侵渔百姓。
王莽命令七公六卿都兼任将军称号，派遣著武将军逯并等人镇守著名的城市，中郎将、绣衣执法各五十五人，分别镇守边境的大郡，监督那些大肆作恶、擅自用兵的人，他们都在外地作奸犯科，扰乱州郡，行贿受贿，掠夺百姓。
[Wang] Mang ordered that the seven highest ministers and the six high ministers should all be concurrently entitled Generals, and sent the General Outstanding in Military Affairs, Lu Ping, and others to control the famous cities, together with 55 Generals of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace and 55 Upholders of the Laws Clad in Embroidered Garments separately to control the large commanderies along the border, to correct the greatly cunning villains who were taking it upon themselves to make dupes of the troops. They all found it convenient to do evil in [the regions] outside [the capital], and caused confusion in the provinces and commanderies, making a business of bribes, taking advantage of the people for their own profit.


莽下书曰：“虏知罪当夷灭，故遣猛将分十二部，将同时出，一举而决绝之矣。
王莽下文告说：“叛虏囊知牙斯罪行应当诛灭宗族，所以派遣猛将分十二路，同时出击，一举歼灭他们。
[Wang] Mang issued a written message, saying, "The caitiff [Lüan-ti] Chih's crimes are such that he is due to be annihilated [with his relatives]. Hence I sent my fierce generals, with separate [commands as] twelve divisional generals, to set out simultaneously and destroy him utterly at one stroke.

内置司命军正，外设军监十有二人，诚欲以司不奉命，令军人咸正也。
在内部设置司命军正，在外部设置军监十二人，实在是想监督不遵命令的人，使军人都品行端正。
Within [the capital], I established Directors of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles] and Chiefs of Armies; outside [the capital] I set up Superintendants of Armies, twelve persons [in all] verily intending that they should have charge over those who do not uphold my mandate and should cause the soldiers all to be upright.

今则不然，各为权势，恐猲良民，妄封人颈，得钱者去。
现在却不是这样，他们各自利用权势，恐吓善良百姓，胡乱给人套上枷锁，得到钱财才释放。
But now they are not so. Each uses his power and influence to intimidate good people, illegally putting seals upon common peoples' necks. When [these officials] secure [a bribe of] cash, they take [the seal] off.

毒蠚并作，农民离散。
毒害同时发生，农民流离失所。
Poisonous and venomous stings are simultaneously performed [at various places], so that the peasants have left [their homes and have become] scattered.

司监若此，可谓称不？
司命军正和军监像这样，能说称职吗？
If the Directors and Superintendants are as the foregoing, can they be said to be suitable [for their offices]?

自今以来，敢犯此者，辄捕系，以名闻。”
从今以后，敢犯这类罪行的，立即逮捕监禁，上报姓名。”
From this time and henceforth, those who presume to offend in this [manner] will be immediately arrested and held [in prison] and their names shall be reported to me."

然犹放纵自若。
然而他们还是照样放纵妄为。
[The officials] however did as they liked just as before.

表彰德行、赏赐功勋，是为了彰显仁贤；九族和睦，是为了褒扬亲属亲情。
Verily, the recompensing of virtuous conduct and the rewarding of achievements are the means of making illustrious men of virtue and stability. Harmony among one's nine [classes of] relatives is their way of making a return for one's love of one's relatives.

予永惟匪解，思稽前人，将章黜陟，以明好恶，安元元焉。”

I will never cease to think deeply, will consider the ways of former [rulers], and will make clear promotions and demotions to manifest approval and disapproval, and to give peace to the people."

以图簿未定，未授国邑，且令受奉都内，月钱数千。
因地图户籍尚未确定，未授予封国封邑，暂且让他们在都内领取俸禄，每月数千钱。
Because the maps and tax registers [for the new division of the country] had not yet been completed, [Wang Mang] had not yet given [these appointees] any states or estates and temporarily ordered that they should receive several thousand cash per month as salary from the [income of] the capital and inner [commanderies].

中郎区博谏莽曰：“井田虽圣王法，其废久矣。
中郎区博劝谏王莽说：“井田制虽是圣王之法，但废弃已久。
A Gentleman-of-the-Household, Ou Po, admonished [Wang] Mang, saying, "Although the ching [system of] cultivated fields was a law of the sage-kings, it has already been abolished for a long time.

周道既衰，而民不从。
周朝制度衰落之后，百姓不再依从。
When the practises of the Chou [dynasty] had decayed, so that the common people did not follow them,

秦知顺民之心，可以获大利也，故灭庐井而置阡陌，遂王诸夏，讫今海内未厌其敝。
秦朝知道顺应民心，可以获得巨大利益，所以废除井田制，设立阡陌，于是统一天下，至今全国仍未厌倦其弊端。
the Ch'in [dynasty] knew how to accommodate itself to the common peoples' minds so as to be able to make great profits. Hence [this dynasty] did away with the cottages of the ching [system] and established [salable] subdivisions [of cultivated fields], and therefore came to rule over all China.

至今，[all] within [the four] seas have not yet had their fill of the perversity of the [Ch'in dynasty in removing the ching system].

今欲违民心，追复千载绝迹，虽尧、舜夏起，而无百年之渐，弗能行也。
现在想要违背民心，恢复千年已绝的制度，即使尧、舜再生，没有百年的渐进过程，也不能实行。
If now you wish to go contrary to the desires of the common people and restore the lost practises of a thousand years ago, even though Yao and Shun should arise again, [yet] without a hundred years of gradual [training], they would be unable to put [these ancient practises] into effect.

天下初定，万民新附，诚未可施行。”
天下刚刚安定，百姓新近归附，实在不可施行。”
The empire has recently been tranquillized and the many common people have newly attached themselves [to you, so that the ching system] cannot yet be really put into practise."


莽知民怨，乃下书曰：“诸名食王田，皆得卖之，勿拘以法。
王莽知道百姓怨恨，于是下文告说：“所有名属王田的，都可以出卖，不要用法律限制。
[Wang] Mang knew that the common people hated [his arrangements], so he issued a written message, which said, "Those who own or enjoy the income from the King's Fields are all permitted to sell them and are not to be restricted by the law.

犯私买卖庶人者，且一切勿治。”
违犯私自买卖平民禁令的，暂且一概不予惩处。”
Those who violated [the law against] private buying and selling of ordinary people [as slaves] will moreover temporarily not be punished."

此前，王莽征发高句骊的军队，准备攻打匈奴，他们不愿前往，郡里强迫他们，于是都逃出边塞，趁机犯法为寇。
Before this, Wang Mang had ordered troops from Kao-chü-li to be mobilized to campaign against the Hu. They did not want to go, and when the commandery forced them, they all fled beyond the frontier and thereupon violated the law and became bandits.

辽西大尹田谭追击之，为所杀。

严尤上奏说：“貉人犯法，不是从驺开始的，即使他有别的心思，也应命令州郡暂且安抚他。
Chuang Yu memorialized, saying, "The violations of the law by the Mo people did not arise from Tsou. Even if [Tsou] had evil intentions, it would be proper to order the provincial and commandery [authorities] temporarily to soothe him.

今猥被以大罪，恐其遂畔，夫馀之属必有和者。
现在随便给他加上大罪，恐怕他会因此反叛，夫馀之类的部族定会有响应的。
If now he is suddenly adjudged [guilty of] a serious crime, it is to be feared that he will thereupon rebel. Some of the Fu-yü and their like would certainly respond to him.

匈奴未克，夫馀、秽貉复起，此大忧也。”
匈奴尚未战胜，夫馀、秽貉又起来反叛，这是大忧患啊。”
The Huns have not yet been conquered, if the Fu-yü and the Wei-mo arise again, there would be serious trouble."

莽不尉安，秽貉遂反，诏尤击之。
王莽不予安抚，秽貉于是反叛，诏令严尤攻打他们。
[Wang] Mang did not [direct the officials] to console and calm [Tsou], and the Wei-mo accordingly revolted. By an imperial edict, [Wang Mang] ordered [Chuang] Yu to attack them.

尤诱高句骊侯驺至而斩焉，传首长安。
严尤引诱高句骊侯驺前来，将他斩杀，把首级传送到长安。
[Chuang] Yu lured Tsou, the marquis of the Kao-chü-li, to come, and beheaded him.

莽大说，下书曰：“乃者，命遣猛将，共行天罚，诛灭虏知，分为十二部，或断其右臂，或斩其左腋，或溃其胸腹，或其两胁。
王莽非常高兴，下文告说：“近来，命令派遣猛将，奉行天罚，诛灭虏知，分为十二路，有的斩断他的右臂，有的斩断他的左腋，有的击溃他的胸腹，有的劈裂他的两胁。
When his head had been transmitted to Ch'ang-an, [Wang] Mang was greatly pleased, and issued a written message which said, "Recently, I have commanded and sent my fierce generals to perform respectfully the punishment [directed by] Heaven, to execute and annihilate the caitiff [Lüan-ti] Chih. They are divided into twelve regiments. Some are to cut off his right arm, some to cut thru his left arm-pit, some to break thru his chest and abdomen, and some to pull out his ribs.

今年刑在东方，诛貉之部先纵焉。
今年刑罚在东方，诛貉的部队先出击。
In this year punishments are in the eastern quarter, so the regiments who were to punish the Mo set out first, arrested and beheaded the caitiff Tsou, and tranquillized and made secure the eastern frontiers.

捕斩虏驺，平定东域，虏知殄灭，在于漏刻。
捕获斩杀虏驺，平定东方地区，虏知的灭亡，就在顷刻之间。
The destruction and annihilation of the caitiff [Lüan-ti] Chih will come in a moment.

这是天地众神、社稷、宗庙保佑的福分，是公卿、大夫、士民同心协力、将帅勇猛如虎的力量所致。
This [success] was a blessing through the aid and assistance of Heaven, Earth, the many gods, the gods of the soils and grains, and the [royal] ancestral temples, and through the power [coming from] the Ministers, Grandees, Officers, and common people being of the same mind and from the generals and lieutenants being [like] roaring tigers.

予甚嘉之。
我非常赞赏他们。
I approve most heartily of them.

其更名高句骊为下句骊，布告天下，令咸知焉。”
将高句骊改名为下句骊，布告天下，使大家都知道。”
Let the name of the Kao (high)-chü-li be changed to be Hsia (low)-chü-li, and let it be published to all the world in order that everyone shall know of it."

于是貉人愈犯边，东北与西南夷皆乱云。
于是貉人更加侵犯边境，东北和西南的外族都发生叛乱。
Thereupon the Mo people violated the borders all the more and the northeastern together with the southwestern barbarians were both in rebellion.


莽志方盛，以为四夷不足吞灭，专念稽古之事，复下书曰：“伏念予之皇始祖考虞帝，受终文祖，在璇玑玉衡以齐七政，遂类于上帝，禋于六宗，望秩于山川，遍于群神，巡狩五岳，群后四朝，敷奏以言，明试以功。
王莽意气正盛，认为四方外族不难吞灭，专心考虑复古之事，又下文告说：“我思念伟大的始祖虞帝，在文祖庙接受禅让，观察璇玑玉衡以整齐七政，于是类祭上帝，禋祭六宗，望祭山川，遍祭众神，巡视五岳，诸侯四朝，进言奏事，明确考察功绩。
[Wang] Mang's intentions were then grand, and he did not consider the barbarians of the four [quarters] worth destroying, but concentrated his mind on searching out ancient ways. He again issued a written message, which said, "I humbly think that my August Deceased First Ancestor, the Lord of Yü, [Shun], `received [Yao's] retirement [from the royal duties in the temple of] the Accomplished Ancestor,' and that he `examined the Fine Jade [Turning] Mechanism and the Jade Balance, in order that he might bring into accord the seven Governors.' Thereupon `he performed the sacrifice lei to the Lords on High, performed the sacrifice yin to his six exemplars, performed the sacrifice from a distance (wang) and arranged in order the mountains and streams, made a universal sacrifice (pien) to the many gods,' `made tours of inspection to' the five sacred peaks, and `held four courts for the various princes, at which they set forth and presented [matters] by word of mouth and were clearly tested by their deeds.'

So he arrested the former General [Repressing Difficulties], Ch'en Ch'in, who had previously said that [Wang Mang] ought to execute [Lüan-ti Teng,] the son [of the Shan-yü], in attendance [upon the Chinese Emperor], and had him bound in prison for another crime.

王莽认为制度确定了天下自然太平，所以专心思考地理，制定礼乐，讲求符合《六经》的说法。
[Wang] Mang's notion was that if institutions were fixed, the empire would naturally become tranquil. Hence he thought in detail concerning geographical arrangements, the institution of rites, and the composition of music. In discussing the harmonization and matching of the explanations to the six Classics,

公卿旦入暮出，议论连年不决，不暇省狱讼冤结民之急务。
公卿从早到晚入宫，议论连年不能决断，没有时间处理诉讼冤案和百姓的紧急事务。
the ministers entered [his presence] at dawn and left at dusk. He discussed for successive years without coming to [final] decisions, so that he did not have leisure to examine law-cases, decide complaints of injustices, or to settle the urgent business of the common people,

Moreover when the Officers of the eleven highest ministers were dispersed to encourage agriculture and sericulture, to proclaim the ordinances for the [various] seasons, and to examine into various documentary matters, the [official] bonnets and [chariot] coverings of one [set of officials] could [almost] be seen by the succeeding [set], and they jostled one another on the roads. They would summon meetings of the officials and common people and arrest eye-witnesses. When the commanderies and counties [gathered] capitation-taxes, [these officials] exchanged bribes and presents, so that [even] white and black were confused and those who watched at the [palace] portals [to intercept] accusations were many.


莽自见前颛权以得汉政，故务自揽众事，有司受成苟免。
王莽自己看到从前专权从而得到汉朝政权，所以务必自己包揽各种事务，官吏接受既定的命令，只求免除罪责。
[Wang] Mang himself knew that he had previously usurped the [imperial] power, and had thereby obtained the government from the Han [dynasty], hence he took care to control the multitude of [government] affairs himself and when the high officials received [orders directing] the detailed disposition [of cases], they merely did enough to avoid [punishment].

他提防臣下就像这样。
Such were [Wang Mang's] fear of and precautions against his courtiers and subordinates.

又喜欢改变制度，政令繁多，应当奉行的，总要反复请示才照办，前后抵触，混乱不清。
He also loved to change and alter the institutions and regulations, so that the government ordinances were numerous, and those which needed to be put into practise had each time to be asked about, before anything could be done. When earlier and later [documents] succeeded each other, they became unclear, confused, and could not be cleared up.

王莽常常点灯到天亮，还不能处理完。

尚书借此舞弊，积压事务，上书等待批复的人连年不能离去，被郡县关押的人遇到大赦才得释放，卫兵三年没有轮换。
Taking advantage of this [circumstance], the Masters of Writing did evil and laid matters aside, so that those who had sent letters to the throne and awaited replies [at the Palace Portals] did not get to leave for successive years. Those who had been arrested and bound [in prison] in the commanderies or counties could only get out when it happened that there was an amnesty, and the soldiers of the [palace] guard were not changed even in the third year.

In the fifth month, [Wang Mang] issued regulations for the salaries of officials, saying, "I have met with the distresses of the nine dry years and the [untoward] occurrences in the 106 [years. The revenues for] the expenses of the state have been insufficient, so that the common people are in disturbance. For the ministers and those of lower [ranks], the emolument for one month has been two rolls of 800-thread linen cloth or one roll of silk.

予每念之，未尝不戚焉。

On the first day of the sixth month, [the day] keng-yin, let all the salaries of officials be for the first time distributed all according to the regulations.

平蛮将军冯茂攻打句町，士兵感染瘟疫，死亡的有十分之六七，征收百姓财物十分取五，益州空虚消耗而没有攻克，被召回关进监狱死去。
The General Tranquillizing the Southern Barbarians, Feng Mou, had attacked Kou-t'ing, and six or seven-tenths of his soldiers had died from pestilence. As a levy for military purposes upon the common people's wealth he had taken five-tenths, so that the Yi Province was empty and waste, yet [the rebellious barbarians] were not vanquished. [Wang Mang] summoned him to return and sent him to prison, where he died.

更遣宁始将军廉丹与庸部牧史熊击句町，颇斩首，有胜。
又派遣宁始将军廉丹与庸部牧史熊攻打句町，斩杀了不少敌人，取得胜利。
In his place, [Wang Mang] sent the General of a Peaceful Beginning, Lien Tan, together with the [Provincial] Shepherd of Yung Regional Division, Shih Hsiung, to attack Kou-t'ing. When they had cut off a considerable [number of] heads and had had a victory,

莽征丹、熊，丹、熊愿益调度，必克乃还。
王莽征召廉丹、史熊，廉丹、史熊希望增加调度，一定要攻克才返回。
[Wang] Mang summoned [Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung [to come to the capital. Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung wanted [instead] to increase the taxes, [whereupon] they would be certain to conquer.

复大赋敛，就都大尹冯英不肯给，上言 “自越巂遂久仇牛、同亭邪豆之属反畔以来，积且十年，郡县距击不已。

Thereupon they returned and again made a great levy for military purposes. The Grand Governor of Chiu-tu [Commandery], Feng Ying, was not willing to furnish [anything], and sent [a memorial] to the throne, saying, "From the time that Chou Niu of Sui-chiu [county] and Hsieh-tou of T'ung Commune and the like in Yüeh-sui [Commandery] revolted, it has been almost the tenth year, in which [time] the commanderies and counties have been resisting the attacks of [the barbarians] without cessation.

续用冯茂，苟施一切之政。
接着任用冯茂，他随意施行各种临时政令。
When, in succession to [Ch'eng Lung], Feng Mou was employed, he temerariously put into practise a temporary policy.

僰道以南，山势险峻深邃，冯茂多次驱赶百姓迁往远方居住，花费数以亿计，官吏士兵遭受毒气死亡的占十分之七。
Although south of P'o-tao the mountains are high and defiles are deep, [Feng] Mou many times expelled their bands from distant places, so that the expense has been counted by the hundred-thousands [of cash] and officers and soldiers have suffered from poisonous emanations, seven-tenths of them dying.

今丹、熊惧于自诡期会，调发诸郡兵、谷，复訾民取其十四，空破梁州，功终不遂。
现在廉丹、史熊害怕自己定下的期限，调发各郡的士兵、粮食，又评估百姓财产收取十分之四，使梁州空虚破败，最终不能成功。
"Now [Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung are afraid that they themselves would be reprimanded [for not having completed their task] in the appointed time, and [seek to] levy and mobilize the troops and grain of the commandery, to re-appraise [the property of] the common people and take four-tenths of it. They have impoverished and ruined Liang Province, but their efforts will not eventually meet with success.

宜罢兵屯田，明设购赏。”
应当停止军事行动，驻军屯田，明确设立奖赏。”
It would be proper to dismiss the troops and garrison farms and openly offer rewards [for the rebels]."

王莽发怒，免去冯英的官职。
[Wang] Mang became angry and dismissed [Feng] Ying from his office.

后颇觉寤，曰：“英亦未可厚非。”
后来渐渐醒悟，说：“冯英也不能过分责备。”
[But] later he awakened considerably to [the truth] and said, "[Feng] Ying should not however be severely condemned,"

复以英为长沙连率。
又任命冯英为长沙连率。
and rewarded [Feng] Ying by making him the Leader of the Combination in Ch'ang-sha [Commandery].

The state of Karashahr (Yen-ch'i) had previously murdered the Protector General Tan Ch'in, so [Wang] Chün wanted to make a surprise attack upon it. He ordered his Associate Lieutenant, Ho Feng, and the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, Kuo Ch'in, to separate their commands [from his].
