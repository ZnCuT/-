孝文皇帝，高祖中子也，母曰薄姬。
孝文皇帝，是汉高祖的第四子，母亲是薄姬。
Emperor Hsiao-wen was a son of Kao-tsu, neither the oldest nor the youngest. His mother was called the Concubine [née] Po.

高祖十一年，诛陈豨，定代地，立为代王，都中都。
高祖十一年（公元前196年），诛杀陈豨，平定代地，就立他为代王，定都于中都。
In the eleventh year of Kao-tsu, [Emperor Kao-tsu] executed Ch'en Hsi, pacified the region of Tai, and made [his son Heng] the King of Tai, with his capital at Chung-tu.

十七年秋，高后崩，诸吕谋为乱，欲危刘氏。
代王十七年（公元前180年）秋，吕后去世，诸吕图谋政变，想夺取刘汉政权。
In the seventeenth year [of Liu Heng's reign as King of Tai], in the autumn, the Empress of Kao-[tsu] died. The [members of] the Lü [clan] plotted to make a rebellion, wishing to endanger the Liu clan.

丞相陈平、太尉周勃、朱虚侯刘章等共诛之，谋立代王。
丞相陈平、太尉周勃、朱虚侯刘章等共诛吕氏，共商迎立代王刘恒为皇帝。
The Lieutenant Chancellor, Ch'en P'ing, the Grand Commandant, Chou P'o, the Marquis of Chu-hsü, Liu Chang, and others together executed them, [then] planned to set up the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, as the next emperor].

语在《高后纪》、《高五王传》。
史事记入《汉书·高后纪、高五王传》中。
A discussion [of the foregoing matters] is found in the "Annals of the Empress of Kao-[tsu]" and in the "Memoirs of the Five Kings [Who Were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]."

大臣遂使人迎代王。
大臣们派人迎接代王。
The great officials thereupon sent some people to invite the King of Tai to come.

郎中令张武等议，皆曰：“汉大臣皆故高帝时将，习兵事，多谋诈，其属意非止此也，特畏高帝、吕太后威耳。
代王的郎中令张武等商议后，说：“汉朝大臣都是高帝时的一些老将，熟习军事，深谙权谋机诈，其内心并不满足于现在的地位，只是害怕高帝与吕后的威严罢了。
His Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Chang Wu, and others discussed [the matter] and all said, "The great officials of the Han [court] were all generals of the time of the deceased Emperor Kao-[tsu], are experienced in military affairs, and [use] many stratagems and deceits. Their intentions [may] not stop with this [proposal]. They feared only the majesty of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the Empress Dowager [née] Lü.

今已诛诸吕，新喋血京师，以迎大王为名，实不可信。
现在诸吕已诛，又血溅京都，此时以迎大王入京称帝为名，实在令人难以置信。
Now they have executed the [members of] the Lü [clan] and have newly tasted blood in the capital. They use [this] invitation to you, great King, as a pretext; in reality they cannot be trusted.

愿称疾无往，以观其变。”
希望大王以有病为由不要前往，以观察情况的变化。”
We hope that you will announce yourself ill and not go [to the capital], in order to watch their moves."

中尉宋昌进曰：“群臣之议皆非也。
中尉宋昌进言道：“他们这些议论是错误的。
The Palace Military Commander [of Tai], Sung Ch'ang, stepped forward and said, "The opinion of the courtiers is wrong.

夫秦失其政，豪杰并起，人人自以为得之者以万数，然卒践天子位者，刘氏也，天下绝望，一矣。
秦朝朝纲紊乱，豪杰并起，想取代秦朝而得南面称帝的不下万人，但最后能君临天下的，仅刘氏一家，天下怀有非分之想的人已感绝望，这是其一。
When the Ch'in [dynasty] lost its control, braves and heroes arose together, each one [of whom] thought he would obtain [the imperial throne]—they could be counted by the ten thousands. Nevertheless the person who finally mounted the throne of the Son of Heaven was of the Liu clan. [These ambitious people of] the world have given up any hopes [of attaining that throne. The foregoing is] the first point.

高帝王子弟，地犬牙相制，所谓盘石之宗也，天下服其强，二矣。
高皇帝封子弟为王，封地犬牙交错，这就成了磐石般的核心，天下服于刘汉的强大，这是其二。
"The Emperor Kao-[tsu] made kings of his sons and kinsmen. Their territories interlock like the teeth of a dog; they are what may be called, `being founded on a rock.' The world has submitted to their power. [The foregoing is] the second point.

汉兴，除秦烦苛，约法令，施德惠，人人自安，难动摇，三矣。
汉朝建立，废除了秦朝的苛敛，减省刑罚，广施德惠，人人自安，深得人心，此其三。
"When the Han [dynasty] arose, it did away with the vexatiousness and harshness of the Ch'in [dynasty], reduced [the number of] their laws and ordinances, and showed its virtue and bounty. Everyone is satisfied, and it would be hard to move or shake [them from their allegiance to the Han dynasty. The foregoing is] the third point.

夫以吕太后之严，立诸吕为三王，擅权专制，然而太尉以一节入北军，一呼士皆袒左，为刘氏，畔诸吕，卒以灭之。
而以吕太后那样的威严，立诸吕为三王，擅权专制，然而太尉周勃持一符节进入北军，一声呼唤士卒都左袒，支持刘氏，反对诸吕，结果把吕氏消灭了。
"Moreover, although, by means of her power, the Empress Dowager [née] Lü established three kings from the Lü [clan] and arrogated to herself the [imperial] power, [issuing imperial] decrees on her own authority, yet when the Grand Commandant [Chou P'o] by means of one credential entered the Northern Army and once gave a call, the soldiers all bared their left arms [to show that they were] for the Liu clan, rebelled against the Lü [clan], and finally, for this reason, exterminated [the Lü clan].

此乃天授，非人力也。
由此可见刘汉政权出于天授，不是靠少数人力可改变的。
This [triumph] then was bestowed by Heaven, it was not [achieved] by human power.

今大臣虽欲为变，百姓弗为使，其党宁能专一邪？
如今虽然有的大臣想要发动政变，但百姓不愿听其驱使，靠他的少数党羽就能够达到目的吗？
Although the great officials should now wish to do something else [than seat as emperor a scion of the Liu clan], the people would not permit themselves to be used by them; how could their faction [seize] the sole power?

内有朱虚、东牟之亲，外畏吴、楚、淮南、琅邪、齐、代之强。
京都内有朱虚侯、东牟侯的团结，外有吴、楚、淮南、琅王牙、齐、代的强大。
Inside [the capital] there are your relatives, [the Marquis of] Chu-hsü, [Liu Chang], and [the Marquis of] Tung-mou, [Liu Hsing-chü]; outside [the capital they would have to] fear the power of [the kingdoms of] Wu, Ch'u, Huai-nan, Lang-ya, Ch'i, and Tai.

方今高帝子独淮南王与大王，大王又长，贤圣仁孝闻于天下，故大臣因天下之心而欲迎立大王，大王勿疑也。”
如今高帝之子只有淮南王与大王您，大王居长，圣贤仁孝，名播天下，所以朝中大臣顺万民之望而想迎立大王，大王就不必有所顾虑了。”
Just now of the sons of the Emperor Kao-[tsu], there are only the King of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang] and yourself, great King. You, great King, are moreover the elder [of the two]. Your ability, your sageness, your paternal love, and your filial piety are known all over the world; hence the great officials are following the hopes of the world in desiring to welcome and establish you, great King, [on the imperial throne]. You, great King, should not have any doubts."

代王报太后，计犹豫未定。
代王禀报太后，一时也难以决策。
The King of Tai reported [the matter] to his Queen Dowager. They discussed it, [but] hesitated and did not reach a decision.

卜之，兆得大横。
便让人占卜，兆得大横。
[Then] they divined about it by means of the tortoise-shell. The lines obtained were the `great transversal.'

占曰：“大横庚庚，余为天王，夏启以光。”
卜人占辞道：“大横亘亘，我为天王，夏启光宗耀祖。”
The interpretation was: "The `great transversal' [means] a great change. I [the recipient of the oracle] will be the Heavenly King. [Emperor] Ch'i of the Hsia [dynasty] thereby [likewise] glorified [his ancestors by continuing the dynasty]."

代王曰：“寡人固已为王，又何王乎？”
代王说：“寡人本来就是王，又何必加一个王号呢？”
The King of Tai said, "I am of course already a king; how could I again be made a king?"

卜人曰：“所谓天王者，乃天子也。”
卜人说：“卦中所谓的天王，就是天子啊！”
The diviner replied, "By this phrase, `the Heavenly King,' is [meant] however the Son of Heaven."

于是代王乃遣太后弟薄昭见太尉勃，勃等具言所以迎立王者。
于是代王派遣太后的弟弟薄昭见太尉周勃，周勃等详细报告了迎立代王的真意。
Thereupon the King of Tai then sent Po Chao, the younger brother of his Queen Dowager, to see the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o and the others told him all their reasons for inviting and seating the King [of Tai on the imperial throne.

昭还报曰：“信矣，无可疑者。”
薄昭回报代王说：“是可信的，没什么可怀疑的。”
Po] Chao returned and reported, "They are indeed trustworthy. There is nothing suspicious."

代王笑谓宋昌曰：“果如公言。”
代王笑对宋昌说：“果然如先生所言。”
The King of Tai laughingly said to Sung Ch'ang, "It is really as you, sir, said."

乃令宋昌骖乘，张武等六人乘六乘传，诣长安，至高陵止，而使宋昌先之长安观变。
就派宋昌主管车驾，派张武等六人快马去长安报信。车驾到高帝陵停止前进，而派宋昌先到长安观察动静。
Then he ordered Sung Ch'ang to be his Chariot Companion, Chang Wu and others, six persons in all, to ride in six `riding chariots,' and went to Ch'ang-an. When he came to Kao-ling, he stopped and sent Sung Ch'ang ahead to Ch'ang-an to observe how things had turned.

昌至渭桥，丞相已下皆迎。
宋昌到达渭桥，丞相以下的官员都来迎接。
When [Sung] Ch'ang reached the Wei [River] Bridge, all [the officials, including] the Lieutenant Chancellor and [those ranking] below [him], welcomed [Sung] Ch'ang.

昌还报，代王乃进至渭桥。
宋昌到高陵回报代王，于是代王也进达渭桥。
He returned and reported; then the King of Tai advanced to the Wei [River] Bridge.

群臣拜谒称臣，代王下拜。
群臣以臣子之礼拜见代王，代王亦谦逊回拜。
[There] the officials bowed and paid their respects to him, calling themselves his subjects. The King of Tai got down [from his carriage] and bowed to them.

太尉勃进曰：“愿请间。”
太尉周勃进言说：“请求秘密禀陈。”
The Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, advanced and said, "I wish to beg for a word in private."

宋昌曰：“所言公，公言之；所言私，王者无私。”
宋昌说：“要是太尉所陈的是公事，就请当着众臣的面上奏；要是所陈的是私事，王者是无私的。”
Sung Ch'ang replied, "If what you have to say is of public [interest], say it publicly; if what you have to say is of private [concern], a [true] king has no private [interests]."

太尉勃乃跪上天子玺。
太尉周勃就跪着送上天子玉玺。
The Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o then knelt and offered the imperial seal [and credentials] of the Son of Heaven.

代王谢曰：“至邸而议之。”
代王辞谢说：“请到京都王宫再议。”
The King of Tai refused them and said, "Let us go to the prince's lodge and discuss this matter."

闰月己酉，入代邸。
闰九月二十九日，进入代王官邸。
In the intercalary month on [the day] chi-yu, [the King of Tai, Liu Heng,] entered the prince's lodge of Tai.

群臣从至，上议曰：“丞相臣平、太尉臣勃、大将军臣武、御史大夫臣苍、宗正臣郢、朱虚侯臣章、东牟侯臣兴居、典客臣揭再拜言大王足下：子弘等皆非孝惠皇帝子，不当奉宗庙。
群臣都跟着来了，呈上奏议说：“丞相臣陈平、太尉臣周勃、大将军臣柴武、御史大夫臣张苍、宗正臣刘郢、朱虚侯臣刘章、东牟侯臣刘兴居、典客臣刘揭再拜进言于大王足下：子弘等都不是孝惠帝之子，不应继承帝位。
The courtiers followed him to [the lodge]. They presented [the results of] their discussion, saying, "The Lieutenant Chancellor your subject [Ch'en] P'ing, the Grand Commandant your subject [Chou] P'o, the General-in-chief your subject [Kuan Ying], the Grandee Secretary your subject [Chang] Ts'ang, the Superintendant of the Imperial House your subject [Liu] Ying-[k'o], the Marquis of Chu-hsü your subject [Liu] Chang, the Marquis of Tung-mou your subject [Liu] Hsing-chü, and the Director of Guests your subject [Liu] Chieh, making repeated obeisances, say to your Highness the great King: the [Imperial] Sons [Lü] Hung and the others are all not sons of Emperor Hsiao-hui and have no right to have charge of [the worship in] the [imperial] ancestral temples.

臣谨请阴安侯、顷王后、琅邪王、列侯、吏二千石议，大王高皇帝子，宜为嗣，愿大王即天子位。”
臣谨请阴安、顷王后、琅王牙王、列侯、吏二千石等相议，大王是高皇帝之子，应当继承，愿大王即天子位。”
Your subjects have respectfully begged the Marquise of Yin-an, the Queen of King Ch'ing, the King of Lang-ya [Liu Tse], the marquises, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs to discuss [this matter, and we all say]: You, great King, are the son of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and are the proper [person] to be his successor. We hope that you, great King, will take the throne of the Son of Heaven."

代王曰：“奉高帝宗庙，重事也。
代王说：“奉祀高帝宗庙，这是重大的事。
The King of Tai replied, "The upholding [of the worship] in the Temple of Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the [imperial] ancestral temples is a weighty matter.

寡人不佞，不足以称。
寡人不才，不足以担当此任。
I am lacking in ability and am not the person suitable [for this task].

愿请楚王计宜者，寡人弗敢当。”
愿请高帝之弟楚王考虑合适人选，寡人实不敢当。”
I hope that you will ask the King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao] to consider who is suitable. I personally do not dare to undertake [this task]."

群臣皆伏，固请。
群臣都拜伏于地，坚决请求代王同意。
While all the courtiers prostrated themselves and insistently begged him.

代王西乡让者三，南乡让者再。
代王向西辞让三次，向南辞让两次。
the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, then] facing the west, refused thrice, and, when facing the south, refused twice.

丞相平等皆曰：“臣伏计之，大王奉高祖宗庙最宜称，虽天下诸侯万民皆以为宜。
丞相陈平等都说：“臣衷心认为，大王继承高皇帝大统最为相称，天下诸侯万民都认为是天经地义。
The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, and the others all said, "Your subjects have humbly deliberated over this [matter]. You, great King, are the most suitable and capable [person] to receive [charge of] the Temple of Kao-tsu and the [imperial] ancestral temples. Even though the nobles and the people of the world all consider you suitable.

臣等为宗庙、社稷计，不敢忽。
臣等为宗庙社稷考虑，不敢怠慢。
we, your servants, who have been planning for the sake of the [dynasty's] ancestral temples and the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, have not dared to be careless.

愿大王幸听臣等。
希望大王能俯顺臣等的请求。
We hope that you, great King, will favor us by listening to your servants.

臣谨奉天子玺、符再拜上。”
臣谨奉天子玉玺符节再拜呈上。”
Your servant, respectfully holding the seals and the credentials of the Son of Heaven, making repeated obeisances, presents them [to you]."

代王曰：“宗室、将、相、王、列侯以为莫宜寡人，寡人不敢辞。”
代王说：“既然宗室、将相、王侯认为寡人是合适的皇位继承人，寡人就不敢推辞了。”
The King of Tai said, "If the imperial house, the generals, the chancellors, the kings, and the marquises consider that there is no one more suitable than myself, I would not dare to refuse."

遂即天子位。
于是即天子位。
Thereupon he took the throne of the Son of Heaven.

使太仆婴、东牟侯兴居先清宫，奉天子法驾迎代邸。

and issued an edict, which said, "An imperial edict of decree to the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en P'ing], the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o, and the Grandee Secretary [Chang Ts'ang]. In the interval [since the last legitimate ruler], the Lü [clan] has been directing affairs, arbitrarily assuming the [imperial] authority, and plotting to commit treason, [thereby] seeking to endanger the ancestral temples of the Liu clan. Thanks to the generals, the chancellors, the marquises, the imperial house, and the great ministers, [the Lü clan] have been executed and have all suffered for their crimes.

朕初即位，其赦天下，赐民爵一级，女子百户牛、酒，酺五日。”

下诏说：“前时吕产自封为相国，吕禄为上将军，擅遣将军灌婴领兵击齐，企图取代刘汉。
An imperial edict said, "Formerly Lü Ch'an set himself up as Chancellor of State, [set up] Lü Lu as First [Ranking] General and unauthorizedly sent General Kuan Ying with troops to attack [the army of] Ch'i, wishing to substitute [the Lü clan] for the Liu clan.

正月，有司请蚤建太子，所以尊宗庙也。
正月，有关官吏请文帝早立太子，是为了尊崇宗庙。
In the first month the [high] officials begged [the Emperor] to name his Heir-apparent soon, so as to honor the ancestral temples.

诏曰：“朕既不德，上帝神明未歆飨也，天下人民未有惬志。
文帝下诏说：“朕德行浅薄，上天神明并不情愿享受我对他们的祭祀，天下人民也认为我还不是他们理想中的皇帝。
His imperial edict read, "Since We are without virtue, the Lords on High and the gods have not enjoyed Our sacrifices [to them] and the people of the empire have not satisfied their desires.

今纵不能博求天下贤圣有德之人而嬗天下焉，而曰豫建太子，是重吾不德也。
今日不能广求天下圣贤有德之人来接替帝位，却建议要早立太子，这就使我的薄德更亏了。
Now even if I cannot search through the empire thoroughly for the [most] capable, sage, and virtuous man [to whom I might] resign the empire, yet, to speak of appointing my Heir-apparent before hand is to double my lack of virtue.

谓天下何？其安之。”
这怎么能满足天下的人对我的期待？立太子事暂缓计议。”
What shall I say to the empire [in justification of such an act]? Be satisfied [with the present situation]."

有司曰：“豫建太子，所以重宗庙、社稷，不忘天下也。”
有关官吏又上奏：“早定太子，正是以宗庙社稷为重，证明皇上时时把天下大事牢记于心的。”
The [high] officials replied, "To appoint an heir-apparent beforehand is the means whereby to be mindful of the ancestral temples and the gods of the soils and grains and not neglect the empire."

上曰：“楚王，季父也，春秋高，阅天下之义理多矣，明于国家之体。
皇上说：“楚王，是朕的叔父，年高德劭，具有丰富的阅历与经验，对治理国事了如指掌。
The Emperor said, "The King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao] is my youngest uncle; since he is advanced in years, he has seen much of the justice and natural law of the world and has a clear understanding of the constitution of the state.

吴王于朕，兄也；淮南王，弟也：皆秉德以陪朕，岂为不豫哉！
吴王、淮南王与朕是兄弟。他们都是秉德以辅朕，这岂不是早已安排好了皇位继承人么！
The King of Wu [Liu P'i] is to Us as an older brother. The King of Huai-nan [Liu Chang] is [Our] younger brother. All of them are embracing virtue. [If one of these three men] were made to reinforce Us, would not that be adequate [provision for upholding the ancestral temples and the gods]?

诸侯王、宗室昆弟有功臣，多贤及有德义者，若举有德以陪朕之不能终，是社稷之灵，天下之福也。
各侯王宗室兄弟中有不少功臣，有不少贤德仁义之人。要是从上述贤人中推举有崇高德行的以接替朕不能胜任的帝位，这就是社稷之灵，天下之福了。
Among the vassal kings, the imperial house, my older and younger brothers [and cousins], and my meritorious subjects, there are many who are capable and also virtuous and just; if you select one who is virtuous to reinforce [Us] in doing what We cannot accomplish, that would be a blessing from the gods of the soils and grains and a [piece of] good fortune for the empire.

今不选举焉，而曰必子，人其以朕为忘贤有德者而专于子，非所以忧天下也。
今日不去推选贤人，而说一定要立太子，人们就会认为朕忘记了贤德之人而一心要让自己的儿子继位，这不是真正的在关心天下大事。
Now you do not select and present [one of them], but say that [the heir] must be [Our] son, [so that] people will think that We have neglected the capable and virtuous, think only of [Our] sons, which is not the way to care about the empire.

朕甚不取。”
朕实不愿采纳。”
We will certainly not adopt [this procedure]."

有司固请曰：“古者殷、周有国，治安皆且千岁，有天下者莫长焉，用此道也。
有关官员再三请求说：“古代殷、周得天下，长治久安近千年。以往有天下的都不及殷周相传久远，就是因为殷、周都采用传位于太子之道。
The [high] officials insistently begged [the Emperor], saying, "In ancient times, when the Yin and Chou [dynasties] possessed their states, good order and peace [reigned], and they both [lasted] for almost a thousand years. [The reason that] none of [the dynasties] who possessed the empire [lasted] as long [as they] is because they used this method.

立嗣必子，所从来远矣。
立太子一定要是皇帝的儿子，历史上从来如此。
The source [of the practise] of always making one's successor a son is already very distant.

高帝始平天下，建诸侯，为帝者太祖。
高皇帝开始平定天下，建立诸侯，成为刘汉皇帝的太祖。
Emperor Kao-[tsu], who first pacified the empire and established the nobles, is the Great Founder of emperors.

诸侯王、列侯始受国者亦皆为其国祖。
各侯王列侯开始受封国的也都成为封国的国祖。
The vassal kings and marquises who first received their kingdoms are also the founders for their kingdoms.

曾听到有的官吏在发放养老粮时，竟给以陈粟烂米，这能说是在贯彻养老的诏令吗？！现在具体制定条例。”
"Now [We] have heard that officials when giving grain to those who should receive gruel sometimes use stale millet. How can this befit the intention of caring for the aged? For all these matters [you should prepare] ordinances."

有司请令县道，年八十已上，赐米人月一石，肉二十斤，酒五斗。
有关官吏通知各县、道，年在八十以上，赐每人每月米一石，肉二十斤，酒五斗。

当今列侯多居于长安，离封邑甚远，吏卒供给输送甚为劳苦，而列侯亦无机会去教训其封邑的人民。

In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "According to the ancient [mode of] governing the world, in the court there was the banner for initiating improvements, and the post for speaking ill and criticizing, whereby there was kept open the way for [good] government and [whereby] remonstrances were caused to come [to the Emperor]. Now in the law there are the crimes of speaking evil and criticizing and of monstrous speech. These [laws] keep the courtiers from daring to express their whole feelings so that the sovereign has no means of hearing about his mistakes and errors.

将何以来远方之贤良？其除之。
这怎么能让远方的贤良来批评朝政？应该废除。
By what means then [can we make] capable and good [people] from distant quarters come [to Us]? Let [these laws] be abrogated.

民或祝诅上，以相约而后相谩，吏以为大逆，其有他言，吏又以为诽谤。
百姓有时咒诅君上，开始互相邀约而后来又互相欺诳，这种只有犯罪动机而无犯罪行动，官吏以为是大逆不道，若有其他言论，官吏又加以诽谤之罪名。

此细民之愚无知抵死，朕甚不取。
这是小民的愚昧表现，由于不懂法律而触犯死罪，朕认为甚不恰当。

诏曰：“道民之路，在于务本。
皇上下诏说：“导民的途径，在于抓住农业这个根本。
An imperial edict said, "The road along which to guide the people is [to make them] devote themselves to fundamentals.

朕亲率天下农，十年于今，而野不加辟。
朕亲自耕作以劝勉农耕，已经十年了，而田野尚得不到充分开垦。
We Ourselves have led the world in agriculture for ten years down to the present, yet to the countryside there has not been added any newly broken land.

岁一不登，民有饥色，是从事焉尚寡，而吏未加务也。
每逢年景不好，百姓就处于饥饿状态，这是因为从事农业的人尚不足，而各地官吏未能认真重视农业的缘故。
and [as soon as] one year has not a good harvest, the people have hungry looks. This [shows that] those who apply themselves to [agriculture] are still too few, and that moreover the officials have not especially put their attention on it.

吾诏书数下，岁劝民种树，而功未兴，是吏奉吾诏不勤，而劝民不明也。
我多次下诏，每年劝百姓多植树，而功效甚微，这也是地方官吏执行我的诏令不认真，对百姓的宣传动员更没有明确的措施所致。
I have many times put forth edicts, and yearly have urged the people to plant and sow, but the results [of my action] have not yet appeared. This is [because] the officials have not been diligent in upholding my edicts or [because] they have not been intelligent in urging the people [to agriculture].

且吾农民甚苦，而吏莫之省，将何以劝焉？
加之我们的农民负担苦重，而地方官吏又漠不关心，这怎能提高农民的生产积极性？
Forsooth, my farmers [have suffered] very bitterly, and yet the officials have perceived none of it; how then can [the officials effectively] encourage [agriculture]?

其赐农民今年租税之半。”
为此今年免除农民应交赋税的一半。”
Let there be granted to the farmers this year half of the land tax and tax on produce."

又曰：“孝悌，天下之大顺也；力田，为生之本也；三老，众民之师也；廉吏，民之表也。
诏书又说：“尊老爱幼，是最高尚的社会风气。努力耕作，是最重要的生活根本。三老，是人民的老师，廉吏，是人民的表率。
[The edict] also said, "The Filially Pious and the Fraternally Respectful are the most advantageous [persons] in the world. The Cultivators of the Fields are the fundamental sources of life. The San-lao are the teachers of the people. Honest officials are an example to the people.

朕甚嘉此二三大夫之行。
朕特别钦佩孝悌力田、三老与廉吏的操行。
We greatly approve of the conduct of these few [kinds of] grandees.

今万家之县，云无应令，岂实人情？
今日万家之县，却说无人可应察举之令，岂能符合事实？
"Now in prefectures of ten thousand families it is said, `There are none who [are able to] conform to [the Emperor's] order.' How can peoples' natures be really [so inadequate]?

是吏举贤之道未备也。
这反映了地方官吏举贤的措施不够得力。
This is because the way the officials have of recommending the capable is not adequate.

其遣谒者劳赐三老、孝者帛，人五匹；悌者、力田二匹；廉吏二百石以上率百石者三匹。
现派专使慰问三老，人赏帛五匹，爱幼的、力田的每人赏帛二匹，廉吏二百石以上每一百石加赏三匹。
Let Internuncios be sent to recompense and make grants: to the San-lao and the Filially Pious, five pieces of silk per person, to the Fraternally Respectful and the Cultivators of the Fields, two pieces, to the honest officials of [the rank of] two thousand piculs and above, for every hundred piculs, three pieces.

及问民所不便安，而以户口率置三老、孝、悌、力田常员，令各率其意以道民焉。”
为了经常了解百姓不安心或不便农业的情况，现按户口若干设置三老、孝悌力田管理人员，让他们深刻领会诏书的意义而教化百姓。”
When [the Internuncio] arrives, [let him] ask the people if there is anything inconvenient or discontenting, and let him establish the regular number of San-lao, Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Cultivators of the Fields in accordance with the number of households and people, and order each to apply himself with all his mind in order to guide the people [aright]."

In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the foundation of the world. No duty is greater.

今廑身从事，而有租税之赋，是谓本末者无以异也，其于劝农之道未备。
今日农人勤身耕作，而与商贾同出租赋，这就是本末无有差别，是不符合于奖励农耕的原则的。
Now if [anyone] personally follows this pursuit diligently, he has yet [to pay] the impositions of the land tax and tax on produce. This is making no distinction between [the treatment of what is] fundamental and [what is] least important. This is not appropriate to [Our] way of encouraging agriculture.

其除田之租税。
现免除农田租税。
Let there be abolished the land tax and tax on produce [levied] upon the [cultivated] fields.

赐天下孤寡布、帛、絮各有数。”
赐天下孤寡布帛、丝絮各若干。”
and let there be granted to the orphans and widows of the empire [linen] cloth, silk, and silk wadding, to each person a definite amount."

皇上亲自劳军，进行检阅，申明教令，赏赐士卒。
The Emperor himself inquired about the army's welfare and aroused the troops by reiterated instructions and orders and by making grants to the officers and soldiers.

自欲征匈奴，群臣谏，不听。
皇上打算亲征匈奴，群臣谏阻，不听。
He himself wanted to make the expedition against the Huns. When the courtiers remonstrated, he would not listen.

皇太后固要上，乃止。
皇太后痛切要求皇上不要亲冒矢石，皇上才罢其意。
[but] when the Empress Dowager earnestly besought him, the Emperor however stopped.

In the spring, an imperial edict said, "It is now the fourteenth year that We have had [the opportunity] to present the sacrificial oxen, the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk for the service of the Lords on High and the [imperial] ancestral temples.

历日弥长，以不敏不明而久抚临天下，朕甚自愧。
在位的时间很久，以无所作为之人长期君临天下，朕深感惭愧。
As the elapsed time has become longer and longer, and [We] have been neither intelligent nor brilliant, yet have controlled and governed the world for a long time, We Ourselves are very much ashamed [because We are unworthy].

其广增诸祀坛场、珪币。
只有扩大祭祀规模与增加祭品精度以谢神祗。
Let there be extended and augmented the mounds on which sacrifices are made, the level places for sacrifice, the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk at the various sacrifices.

昔先王远施恩泽不求其报，望祀不祈其福，
昔日先王远施恩泽而不求他人报答，虔诚祭祀而不祈个人福祉。
"Formerly the ancient Kings extended [their benefits] far and wide and did not seek for any recompense; they performed the sacrifice from a distance [to the great mountains and rivers], but did not pray for their own happiness.

右贤左戚，先民后己，至明之极也。
厚贤薄亲，先民后己，实为英明之极。
In the place of honor were the sages, in the less honorable place were their relatives; The people [came] first, they put themselves last; [this was] the extreme of the utmost wisdom.

今吾闻祠官祝釐，皆归福于朕躬，不为百姓，朕甚愧之。
现我闻祠官祝福，都希望福祉集于朕身，而不为百姓祈祷，这使朕更为愧疚。
Now I have heard that when the sacrificial officials pray for happy omens, they all [endeavor to make] happiness revert upon Our private person, and do not [pray] for [Our] subjects. We are very much ashamed at this.

夫以朕之不德，而专乡独美其福，百姓不与焉，是重吾不德也。
以朕这不德之人，一心追求个人的美满幸福，而不与百姓同享，这就更为增加了我的过失。
If now, in spite of Our lack of virtue, [We] nevertheless specially and solely enjoy the good [coming] from their [prayers for] happiness, and my subjects have no share in it, that will double my lack of virtue.

其令祠官致敬，无有所祈。”
现令祠官向神祗致敬，切不可为我个人祈福。”
Let it be ordered that the sacrificial officials, in presenting their respectful [offerings], should not beg for anything."

We are ignorant and not perspicacious and do not yet understand just what is to blame.

意者朕之政有所失而行有过与？
是朕的政事有所失且行为有缺点呢？
Is it that Our [way of] government has some faults and [Our] conduct has some errors?

乃天道有不顺，地利或不得，人事多失和，鬼神废不享与？
还是天道有不顺，地利难以得，人事多失和，鬼神不愿享受祭祀呢？
Or is it that [We] have not obeyed the Way of Heaven or have perhaps not obtained the advantages of Earth, or are the affairs of men in great discord, or have the spirits and divinities been neglected [so that] they have not enjoyed [Our offerings]?

何以致此？
到底是何种原因？
How has this been brought about?

将百官之奉养或费，无用之事或多与？

How is it that the people's food is scarce and lacking?

夫度田非益寡，而计民未加益，以口量地，其于古犹有余，而食之甚不足，者其咎安在？
度量耕地并未减少，统计人口增加的也不多，按人口平均占有耕地，比之于古代还要多，而粮食却极为不足，失误的根源何在？
"Now when the fields are measured, they have not decreased, and when the population is counted, it has not increased, [so that] the amount of land per person is greater than in ancient times. Yet there is very much too little food; where does the blame for it lie?

无乃百姓之从事于末以害农者蕃，为酒醪以靡谷者多，六畜之食焉者众与？
是否由于百姓弃农经商，如大量酿酒而浪费粮食，过多的饲养牲畜而消费粮食以致严重地损害了农业呢？
Is it that Our subjects devote themselves to what is least important, whereby those [persons] who injure agriculture are multiplied? [Is it due to the fact that] they make wine and lees, thereby wasting much grain and that masses of food are given to the six [kinds of] domestic animals?

细大之义，吾未能得其中。
从小与大各方面来探计，我还未能找出症结所在。

The imperial edict said, "Since We are not perspicacious, We have been unable to [extend the influence of Our] virtue to distant [regions]. This has caused states outside the borders sometimes to be disquiet and discontented.

夫四荒之外不安其生，封圻之内勤劳不处，二者之咎，皆自于朕之德薄而不能达远也。
近来边境线上军民不安其生，京畿之内，征夫奔走不息，这两方面的损失，都是由于朕的薄德而不能使远方悦服所致。
夫四荒之外不安其生，封圻之内勤劳不处，二者之咎，皆自于朕之德薄而不能达远也。
"The people beyond the four wildernesses cannot live in peace, and those within the fiefs and the imperial domain toil without rest. The blame for both lies entirely with Our scanty virtue, which fails to reach far.

间者累年，匈奴并暴边境，多杀吏民，边臣兵吏又不能谕其内志，以重吾不德。
过去几年，匈奴不断暴掠边境，杀害不少边疆吏民，而边防官吏，又不能向其晓谕我朝愿意与他们友好相处的意图，更加重了我无德服远的过失。

夫久结难连兵，中外之国将何以自宁？
似此长期兵连祸结，中外之国将怎样保持自身的安宁？
If enmity and warfare persist for a long time, how can both the central and outer states find peace?

今朕夙兴夜寐，勤劳天下，忧苦万民，为之恻怛不安，未尝一日忘于心，故遣使者冠盖相望，结彻于道，以谕朕志于单于。
近日朕早起晚睡，为国事操劳，为万民忧苦。精神上的痛苦与不安，未曾忘怀过一天。所以派遣外交使节频繁来往，车辙如结，以将朕的友好意愿转告于单于王。
Now I rise early and sleep late, toiling for the empire and worrying about the people, feeling compassion and unease, never forgetting this for a single day. Therefore, I have sent envoys with their carriages and hats visible one after another, their wheel tracks unbroken along the road, to make known My intentions to the Shan-yü.

今单于反古之道，计社稷之安，便万民之利，新与朕俱弃细过，偕之大道，结兄弟之义，以全天下元元之民。
今匈奴王恢复以往和睦相处的传统，从双方社稷的安定，两国人民的方便来考虑，愿意和朕都不咎既往，同建睦邻关系，结为兄弟之国，以满足中外人民的愿望。
Now the Shan-yü has returned to the ancient way, considering the security of the state and the benefit of the people. He and I have now both abandoned minor wrongs, walked together on the great path, formed a fraternal bond, and thus protected all the people in the world.
