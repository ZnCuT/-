It is said that once Madam Liu was resting on the banks of a large lake, fell asleep, and dreamed that she met with a god. At that time there was a great thunderstorm and darkness.

高祖曾到咸阳服徭役，得以尽情观看秦始皇，长叹一声说：“唉，大丈夫就应当像这样啊！”
Kao-tsu once went to Ch'ang-an to serve as a minor official, and when he saw Emperor Ch'in Shih-huang on a tour, he sighed and said, "Ah, this is what a real man should be like!"

单父人吕公善沛令，辟仇，从之客，因家焉。
单父县人吕公与沛县县令交好，为了躲避仇人，前往县令那里做客，于是就在沛县安家。

沛县中的豪杰和官吏听说县令有重要的客人，都前往祝贺。
All the officials and gentry of P'ei came to congratulate him on his move.

萧何为主吏，主进，令诸大夫曰：“进不满千钱，坐之堂下。”
萧何担任主吏，负责接收贺礼，对各位宾客说：“进献的贺礼不满一千钱的，在堂下就坐。”
Hsiao Ho was in charge of receiving the guests, and he said, "Those who give less than one thousand coins shall sit in the outer hall."

高祖为亭长，素易诸吏，乃绐为谒曰“贺钱万”，实不持一钱。
高祖担任亭长，一向轻视各位官吏，于是假意在名帖上写道“贺钱一万”，实际上没带一文钱。
Kao-tsu, who was a minor official, came in, wrote on the guest book, "A gift of ten thousand coins," but in fact he had no money.

谒入，吕公大惊，起，迎之门。
名帖递进去后，吕公非常吃惊，起身，到门口迎接他。
When the name card was brought in, Lü Kung was surprised, got up, and went to the gate to welcome him.

吕公者，好相人，见高祖状貌，因重敬之，引入坐上坐。
吕公这个人，喜好给人看相，看到高祖的相貌，就特别敬重他，把他领到堂上首座就坐。
Lü Kung was good at physiognomy, and when he looked at Kao-tsu's face, he was very impressed and treated him with great respect, leading him to the upper seat.

萧何曰：“刘季固多大言，少成事。”
萧何说：“刘季本来就爱说大话，很少办成事情。”
Hsiao Ho said, "Kao-tsu often talks big but does not accomplish much."

高祖因狎侮诸客，遂坐上坐，无所诎。
高祖趁机戏弄耍笑各位宾客，就坐在了上首座位，没有丝毫谦让。
Kao-tsu, however, paid no attention and sat in the upper seat, joking with the others.

酒阑，吕公因目固留高祖。
酒宴快结束时，吕公趁机用眼神示意坚决挽留高祖。
After the banquet, Lü Kung winked at Kao-tsu and asked him to stay.

竟酒，后。吕公曰：“臣少好相人，相人多矣，无如季相，愿季自爱。
酒席结束后，高祖留在后面。吕公说：“我年轻时喜好给人看相，看过的人很多，没有谁的相貌比得上你刘季的，希望你刘季保重自己。
At the end of the feast, [Kao-tsu] stayed behind. Lü Kung said, "I have seen many people in my life, but none as outstanding as you. I hope you will cherish yourself."

臣有息女，愿为箕帚妾。”
我有个亲生女儿，希望能让她做你的妻子，为你打理家务。”
"I have a daughter, and I would like to give her to you as your wife."

酒罢，吕媪怒吕公曰：“公始常欲奇此女，与贵人。
酒宴结束后，吕媪对吕公生气地说：“你当初常常想让这个女儿出人头地，把她嫁给贵人。
After the banquet, Madam Lü was angry with Lü Kung and said, "You always said that our daughter was unusual and should be married to a nobleman."

沛令善公，求之不与，何自妄许与刘季？”
沛县县令和你交好，向你求娶女儿你都不答应，为什么擅自胡乱地把她许配给刘季呢？”
"The magistrate of P'ei proposed to her, but you refused. Why did you give her to Kao-tsu?"

吕公曰：“此非兒女子所知。”卒与高祖。
吕公说：“这不是妇孺之辈所能明白的。”最终把女儿嫁给了高祖。
Lü Kung said, "This is not something you women can understand." He gave his daughter to Kao-tsu in marriage.

吕公女即吕后也，生孝惠帝、鲁元公主。
吕公的女儿就是后来的吕后，生下了孝惠帝、鲁元公主。
She was the future Empress Lü, who gave birth to Emperor Hui and Princess Lu Yuan.

高祖尝告归之田。
高祖曾请假回到家乡种田。
Kao-tsu once asked for leave to return home to work in the fields.

吕后与两子居田中，有一老父过，请饮，吕后因餔之。
吕后和两个孩子住在田间，有一位老汉路过，请求喝水，吕后于是给了他食物吃。
Empress Lü and their two children lived in the fields. An old man passed by and asked for a drink. Empress Lü then gave him food.

老父相后曰：“夫人天下贵人也。”
老汉为吕后看相说：“夫人是天下的贵人啊。”
The old man looked at Empress Lü and said, "Madam, you are a noble person in the world."

令相两子，见孝惠帝，曰：“夫人所以贵者，乃此男也。”
让他给两个孩子看相，看到孝惠帝，说：“夫人之所以尊贵，是因为这个男孩。”
He was asked to look at the two children. When he saw Emperor Hui, he said, "The reason why you are noble, Madam, is this boy."

相鲁元公主，亦皆贵。
给鲁元公主看相，也说她会尊贵。
When he looked at Princess Lu Yuan, he also said she would be noble.

老父已去，高祖适从旁舍来，吕后具言：“客有过，相我子母皆大贵。”
老汉离开后，高祖恰好从旁边的屋舍过来，吕后详细地告诉他说：“有位客人路过，给我母子看相，说我们都将非常尊贵。”
After the old man left, Kao-tsu happened to come from the nearby house. Empress Lü told him in detail, "A guest passed by and read our fortunes, saying that my children and I will all be very noble."

高祖问，曰：“未远。”乃追及，问老父。
高祖问老汉在哪里，吕后说：“还没走远。”高祖于是追上去，问老汉。
Kao-tsu asked where the old man was, and Empress Lü said, "He hasn't gone far." Kao-tsu then chased after him and asked the old man.

老父曰：“乡者夫人兒子皆以君，君相贵不可言。”
老汉说：“刚才看夫人和孩子都因为您而尊贵，您的相貌贵不可言。”
The old man said, "Just now, I saw that your wife and children will be noble because of you. Your appearance is extremely noble, beyond words."

高祖乃谢曰：“诚如父言，不敢忘德。”
高祖于是道谢说：“如果真像您说的那样，我不会忘记您的恩德。”
Kao-tsu thanked him and said, "If what you say is true, I will not forget your kindness."

及高祖贵，遂不知老父处。
等到高祖尊贵之后，就不知道老汉在哪里了。
When Kao-tsu became noble, he no longer knew where the old man was.

高祖为亭长，乃以竹皮为冠，令求盗之薛治，时时冠之，及贵常冠，所谓“刘氏冠”也。
高祖担任亭长时，就用竹皮做帽子，让负责缉捕盗贼的亭卒到薛地去制作，时常戴着它，等到尊贵之后也常常戴着，这就是所说的“刘氏冠”。
When Kao-tsu was a亭 chief, he made a crown of bamboo skin and ordered the thief-catcher to have it made in Xue. He often wore it, and continued to wear it when he became noble. This is what is called the "Liu's Crown."

高祖以亭长为县送徒骊山，徒多道亡。
高祖以亭长的身份为县里押送刑徒去骊山，刑徒大多在途中逃跑了。
As a亭 chief, Kao-tsu was sent by the county to escort convicts to Mount Li. Many convicts escaped on the way.

自度比至皆亡之，到丰西泽中亭，止饮，夜皆解纵所送徒，曰：“公等皆去，吾亦从此逝矣！”
自己估计等到了骊山刑徒就都跑光了，到了丰西的沼泽中的亭舍，停下来饮酒，夜里把所押送的刑徒都放了，说：“你们都走吧，我也从此离开这里了！”
He thought to himself, "By the time we reach Mount Li, all of them will have escaped." When they reached Hsia-pei, they stopped for the night, and Kao-tsu got drunk. He released all the prisoners and said, "You all go your own way. I am going to escape too!"

徒中壮士愿从者十余人。
刑徒中愿意跟随他的壮士有十多人。
The prisoners were very grateful, and about a dozen strong men decided to follow him.

高祖被酒，夜径泽中，令一人行前。
高祖带着酒意，夜里从小路走进沼泽，让一个人在前面探路。
Kao-tsu, with a sword in his hand, walked ahead. Someone reported, "There is a big snake blocking the road ahead. Let's go back."

行前者还报曰：“前有大蛇当径，愿还。”
探路的人回来报告说：“前面有一条大蛇挡住了路，希望回去。”
The person walking ahead came back and reported, "There is a big snake blocking the path ahead. I hope we can go back."

高祖醉，曰：“壮士行，何畏！”乃前，拔剑斩蛇。
高祖醉醺醺地说：“壮士走路，有什么可怕的！”于是上前，拔剑斩断了蛇。
Kao-tsu, who was drunk, said, "A brave man has nothing to fear!" He went forward, cut the snake in two with his sword.

蛇分为两，道开。
蛇被分成两段，道路通了。
The snake was split into two parts, and the road opened up.

行数里，醉困卧。
走了几里路，高祖因醉酒困倦而躺下睡着了。
They continued on their way for several miles, and Kao-tsu fell asleep.

后人来至蛇所，有一老妪夜哭。
后面的人来到斩蛇的地方，有一个老妇人在夜里哭泣。
Later, people came to the place where the snake was cut. An old woman was crying at night.

人问妪何哭，妪曰：“人杀吾子。”
有人问老妇人为什么哭，老妇人说：“有人杀了我的儿子。”
Someone asked her why she was crying, and she said, "My son was killed."

人曰：“妪子何为见杀？”
有人说：“您的儿子为什么被杀死？”
Someone said, "Why was your son killed?"

妪曰：“吾子，白帝子也，化为蛇当道，今者赤帝子斩之，故哭。”
老妇人说：“我的儿子，是白帝的儿子，变成蛇挡在路上，现在被赤帝的儿子斩杀了，所以我哭。”
The old woman said, "My son is the son of the White Emperor. He turned into a snake and blocked the road, but now he was killed by the son of the Red Emperor, so I am crying."

人乃以妪为不诚，欲苦之，妪因忽不见。
人们于是认为老妇人不诚实，想让她受苦，老妇人却忽然不见了。
People thought she was not being honest and wanted to make things difficult for her, but she suddenly disappeared.

后人至，高祖觉。告高祖，高祖乃心独喜，自负。
后面的人赶到，高祖醒了。把这件事告诉了高祖，高祖心里暗自高兴，很是自负。
When the others arrived, Kao-tsu woke up. They told him what had happened, and he was very pleased with himself.

那些跟随他的人一天比一天敬畏他。
His followers became more and more afraid of him day by day.

The assistant magistrate and chief official Xiao He and Cao Can said, "You are an official of Qin. Now you want to betray Qin and lead the young people of Pei. I'm afraid they won't listen."

愿君召诸亡在外者，可得数百人，因以劫众，众不敢不听。”
希望您召集那些逃亡在外的人，能得到几百人，趁机胁迫众人，众人就不敢不听从了。”

沛县县令后悔了，害怕他们有变故，于是关闭城门防守，想要诛杀萧何、曹参。

Kao-tsu then wrote a letter on silk and shot it onto the city wall, telling the elders of Pei:

“天下同苦秦久矣。今父老虽为沛令守，诸侯并起，今屠沛。
“天下人受秦朝的苦已经很久了。现在父老们虽然为沛县县令守城，但是诸侯一同起兵，将要屠戮沛县。
"The whole world has suffered from Qin for a long time. Now although you elders are defending the city for the magistrate of Pei, the feudal lords have risen up together and will massacre Pei."

沛今共诛令，择可立立之，以应诸侯，即室家完。
沛县现在一起杀掉县令，选择可以拥立的人拥立他，来响应诸侯，就能保全家族。
"Now, if Pei kills the magistrate together, chooses someone worthy to support, and responds to the feudal lords, your families will be safe."

不然，父子俱屠，无为也。”
不这样做，父子都会被屠杀，没什么意义。”
"Otherwise, fathers and sons will all be massacred, which is meaningless."

父老乃帅子弟共杀沛令，开城门迎高祖，欲以为沛令。
父老们于是率领年轻人一起杀掉沛县县令，打开城门迎接高祖，想让他做沛县县令。
The elders then led the young people to kill the magistrate of Pei, opened the city gates to welcome Kao-tsu, and wanted him to be the magistrate of Pei.

高祖曰：“天下方扰，诸侯并起，今置将不善，一败涂地。
高祖说：“天下正动荡不安，诸侯一同起兵，现在如果安排的将领不合适，就会一败涂地。
Kao-tsu said, "The world is in turmoil, and the feudal lords have risen together. If we appoint an inappropriate general now, we will be utterly defeated."

吾非敢自爱，恐能薄，不能完父兄子弟。
我不是敢爱惜自己，担心能力浅薄，不能保全父老乡亲、兄弟子侄。
"I do not dare to cherish myself, but I am afraid that my ability is shallow and I cannot protect the elders, 乡亲，brothers and nephews."

此大事，愿更择可者。”
这是大事，希望重新选择合适的人。”
"This is a major event, and I hope to choose a suitable person again."

萧、曹皆文吏，自爱，恐事不就，后秦种族其家，尽让高祖。
萧何、曹参都是文官，爱惜自己，担心事情不能成功，日后秦朝会诛灭他们的家族，都推让给高祖。
Hsiao Ho and Ts'ao Ch'ang were both civil officials who valued their own safety. Fearing that the undertaking might fail and that later the Ch'in [government] would exterminate their families, they all deferred to Kao-tsu.

诸父老皆曰：“平生所闻刘季奇怪，当贵，且卜筮之，莫如刘季最吉。”
众父老都说：“平时听说的刘季的奇异之事，预示他应当显贵，而且占卜的结果，没有谁比刘季更吉利。”
All the elders said, "We have heard all our lives about Liu Ji's strange deeds, which indicate he should be noble. Moreover, the result of divination shows that no one is more auspicious than Liu Ji."

高祖数让，众莫肯为，高祖乃立为沛公。
高祖多次推让，众人没有谁愿意担任，高祖于是被拥立为沛公。
Kao-tsu declined several times, but no one was willing to take [the position], so Kao-tsu was established as the Duke of P'ei.

祠黄帝，祭蚩尤于沛廷，而衅鼓旗。
在沛县的公廷祭祀黄帝、蚩尤，并用牲畜的血涂在鼓和旗帜上举行祭祀仪式。
He sacrificed to Huangdi and Chiyou in the court of Pei, and smeared the drums and flags with the blood of animals to hold a sacrificial ceremony.

帜皆赤，由所杀蛇白帝子，杀者赤帝子故也。
旗帜都为红色，是因为所杀的蛇是白帝的儿子，而斩杀蛇的人是赤帝的儿子的缘故。
The flags were all red because the snake that was killed was the son of the White Emperor, and the one who killed the snake was the son of the Red Emperor.

于是少年豪吏如萧、曹、樊哙等皆为收沛子弟，得三千人。
于是年轻的豪杰官吏如萧何、曹参、樊哙等人都去招收沛县的年轻人，得到三千人。

良曰：“臣为韩王送沛公，不可不告，亡去不义。”
张良说：“我为韩王护送沛公，不能不告诉他，逃走是不义的。”

项伯回去后，把沛公的话全部告诉了项羽，趁机说：“沛公不先打败关中的秦军，您怎么能进入关中呢？

且人有大功，击之不祥，不如因善之。”

The next day, Liu Pang went to Hung-men with more than a hundred cavalry to see Hsiang Yü and apologized, saying, "I and your generalship joined forces to attack Ch'in. Your generalship fought north of the Yellow River, and I fought south of it. I never expected to enter the pass first, defeat Ch'in, and meet your generalship again.

今者有小人言，令将军与臣有隙。”
现在有小人进言，让将军和我产生隔阂。”
"Now there have been slanderous words from petty men that have caused a rift between your generalship and me."

羽曰：“此沛公左司马曹毋伤言之，不然，籍何以至此？”
项羽说：“这是沛公的左司马曹毋伤说的，否则，我怎么会到这种地步？”
Yü said, "It was your Left Sima Ts'ao Wu-shang who said this; otherwise, how would I have come to this?"

羽问：“沛公安在？”

Yü asked, "Where is Liu Pang?"

曰：“闻将军有意督过之，脱身去，间至军，故使臣献璧。”
张良说：“听说将军有意责备他，他脱身离开，从小路回到军营，所以派我献上玉璧。”
