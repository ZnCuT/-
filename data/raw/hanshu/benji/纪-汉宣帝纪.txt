朕不贤明，多次申明诏令公卿、大夫务必施行宽大政策，顺应百姓的疾苦，想要媲美三王的盛业，彰显先帝的德行。
"Since We are unintelligent, [We] have several times made known in [Our] edicts to the ministers and grandees that they ought to practise clemency and generosity and suit [their actions] to the sufferings and bitternesses of the common people, [because We] wished to equal the high attainment of the Three Kings and to manifest the virtue [of Our] imperial predecessors.

今吏或以不禁奸邪为宽大，纵释有罪为不苛，或以酷恶为贤，皆失其中。
现在有的官吏把不禁止奸邪当作宽大，把放纵有罪之人当作不苛刻，有的把残酷凶恶当作贤能，都失去了适中的原则。
"[But] now some officials have thought that not prohibiting wickedness and evil constitutes clemency and generosity and that setting free or dismissing criminals constitutes the absence of tyranny, [whereas] some consider that tyranny and evil-doing constitute capability.

In eulogy we say: [The fundamental principle in] the government of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsüan was [to make] rewards dependable and punishments certain and to examine and confront names with realities. His gentlemen [who were concerned] with government business, who were Literary Scholars, or [were concerned with] law and principles were all excellent in their capacities. Even his artists, craftsmen, workmen, and artisans, his vessels and utensils could seldom be matched in the time of [Emperors] Yüan and Ch'eng, [which fact] is indeed sufficient to indicate that his officials were worthy of their positions and that the common people were satisfied in their occupations.

遇到匈奴叛乱，推翻行将灭亡的，巩固应当存在的，在北夷树立威信，单于仰慕仁义，叩首称藩。
He happened [to live at a time when] the Huns were acting contrary to reason and were in disturbance, [hence he was able] to "overthrow those who should perish, to strengthen those who should be preserved," and to display his majesty to the northern barbarians.
