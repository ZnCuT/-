诏曰：“夫赦令者，将与天下更始，诚欲令百姓改行洁己，全其性命也。
下诏说：“朝廷每发布赦免令，是打算与天下重新开始，真心地希望百姓能洗心革面，以保全其品格与性命的。
An imperial edict said, "Verily an ordinance of amnesty is [an instrument] for the purpose of giving the empire [an opportunity of making] a new beginning. It is sincerely hoped that it may cause the people to correct their conduct, purify themselves, and preserve their lives.

往者有司多举奏赦前事，累增罪过，诛陷亡辜，殆非重信慎刑，洒心自新之意也。
以往有关官员在量刑时多把赦令前所犯的过失重提，累增犯法者的罪过，甚至株陷无辜之人。违背了朝廷发布赦令是为了重信慎刑与希望有罪过的人涤心自新的原意。
In the past, the high officials have frequently brought up in their memorials matters previous to an amnesty, including them [with their present charges, in order to] increase [the severity of peoples'] greater or lesser crimes, [with the result that] they have executed or ruined guiltless [people, which practise] is almost opposite to the intention of emphasizing fidelity and being careful about punishments [and to induce criminals] to purify their hearts and renew themselves.

及选举者，其历职更事有名之士，则以为难保，废而弗举，甚谬于赦小过举贤材之义。
对于举荐的人才，也因为他在历史上曾犯过某种过错，以为不可信任，就废置而不举荐。这就完全背离了孔子说的‘赦小过，举贤才’的原则。
Moreover, in their selections and recommendations [for appointment], if a gentleman has [already] held various offices, has been experienced in [government] affairs, and has acquired a reputation, then [the high officials] consider that [such a person] would be difficult to guarantee, hence, when [such a person has been] dismissed, he is not recommended [again, which practise] is quite contrary to the principle of `pardoning small transgressions and recommending those who are capable and able.'

诸有臧及内恶未发而荐举者，勿案验。
对于虽有经济及品行方面的错误但无人告发而被举荐的人，一律不必查究。
[In the case of] whoever has taken bribes or [has committed] hidden evils which have not yet become known, if he is recommended for a position, let all [such matters] not be investigated judicially,

令士厉精乡进，不以小疵妨大材。
以便鼓励人才集中精力去追求进步，不因小的疵点而妨碍一个难得的人才。
in order that [such] gentlemen may whet their innermost beings and endeavor to improve themselves, and that small flaws may not hamper great talents.

自今以来，有司无得陈赦前事置奏上。
从现在起，有关机构的官员不必陈奏赦前所犯的过失。
From this time and henceforth, high officials shall not be permitted to present matters previous to an amnesty and put them in a memorial to the Emperor.

有不如诏书为亏恩，以不道论。
有不遵此诏书的为有亏皇恩，以违背帝诏论处。
If anyone acts contrary to this written edict, he is acting against the [imperial] favor, [hence] it shall be judged as an inhuman [deed.

定著令，布告天下，使明知之。”
特明著此令，布告天下，使明知其事。”
Let this order] be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance and be published and made known to the empire to cause it to be clearly known."
