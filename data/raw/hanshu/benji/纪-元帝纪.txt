孝元皇帝，宣帝太子也。
汉元帝，是汉宣帝的太子。
Emperor Hsiao-yüan was the Heir-apparent of Emperor Hsüan.

母曰共哀许皇后，宣帝微时生民间。
母亲是恭哀许皇后，宣帝微贱时生于民间。
His mother was entitled Empress Kung-ai [née] Hsü. At the time when Emperor Hsüan was [still] an unimportant person, [the future Emperor Yüan] was born as a commoner.

年二岁，宣帝即位。
年二岁时，宣帝继承帝位。
When he was in his second year, Emperor Hsüan ascended the throne [and began his own reign].

八岁，立为太子。
元帝年八岁时，被立为太子。
and when [the future Emperor Yüan] was in his eighth year, he was made Heir-apparent.

壮大，柔仁好儒。
成年后，宽厚而尊重儒术。
When he had grown up, he was condescending and kind and liked Confucian scholars.

见宣帝所用多文法吏，以刑名绳下，大臣杨恽、盖宽饶等坐刺讥辞语为罪而诛，尝侍燕从容言：“陛下持刑太深，宜用儒生。”
见宣帝所起用的多是法吏，他们以名责实，尊君卑臣以弹治天下，大臣杨恽、盖宽饶等都因犯讥刺君上之罪而被诛戮，常在平时侍奉时从容进言：“陛下持刑太深，应用儒生。”
He saw that there were many written statutes among those employed by Emperor Hsüan; that his [father's] officials ruled their subjects in accordance with [the principle of] circumstances and names; and that [his father's] great courtiers, Yang Yün, Kai K'uan-jao and others, had been sentenced for critical and derogatory sayings, which were made crimes, so that they were executed. [Hence] once when he was waiting upon [Emperor Hsüan] at a banquet, he said, with a deferential bearing, "Your Majesty is too severe in applying the laws. It would be proper to employ Confucian masters [in your government]."

宣帝作色曰：“汉家自有制度，本以霸王道杂之，奈何纯任德教，用周政乎！
宣帝动怒说：“汉家自有制度，本以王霸二道交替使用，为何要专行仁政，效法周朝呢！
Emperor Hsüan changed color and said, "The Han dynasty has its own institutes and laws, which are variously [taken from] the ways of the Lords Protector and the [ideal] Kings. How could I trust purely to moral instruction and use [the kind of] government [exercised by] the Chou [dynasty]?

且俗儒不达时宜，好是古非今，使人眩于名实，不知所守，何足委任？”
况且一般儒生不能用所学结合实际，喜欢厚古薄今，使人惑乱于名实，不知所从，那怎么能委以重任！”
The vulgar Confucians moreover do not understand what is appropriate to the time; they love to approve the ancient and disapprove the present, making people to be confused about names and realities, so that they do not know what they should cherish. How could they be capable of being entrusted with responsibility?"

乃叹曰：“乱我家者，太子也！”
于是叹道：“乱我刘家朝纲的，将是太子啊！”
Thereupon he sighed and said, "The one who will confound my dynasty will be my Heir-apparent."

由是疏太子而爱淮阳王，曰：“淮阳王明察好法，宜为吾子。”
由是就疏太子而爱淮阳王，宣帝说：“淮阳王明于察断而爱学法律，应继承我的事业。”
From this [time on], he became distant to his Heir-apparent and loved [another son], the King of Huai-yang, [Liu Ch'in]. He said, "The King of Huai-yang is intelligent concerning, has examined minutely, and loves the laws. He is worthy to be my son."

而王母张婕妤尤幸。
淮阳王的母亲张婕妤更得宠。
Since, moreover, the King's mother, the Favorite Beauty [née] Chang, was favored the most.

上有意欲用淮阳王代太子，然以少依许氏，俱从微起，故终不背焉。
宣帝有意用淮阳王取代太子，但由于少年微贱时依靠许氏，夫妇义结糟糠，所以最终还是不肯背弃许皇后而另立太子。
the Emperor had the intention of making the King of Huai-yang [his heir] in place of the Heir-apparent. But when [the Emperor] had been young, he had depended upon the Hsü clan, [that of the Heir-apparent's maternal grandfather], together with whom [the Emperor] had arisen from an unimportant station, hence in the end he was not [willing] to turn his back on it [by changing his Heir-apparent].

黄龙元年十二月，宣帝崩。
