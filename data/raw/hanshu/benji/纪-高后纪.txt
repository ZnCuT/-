产不知禄已去北军，入未央宫欲为乱。
吕产不知吕禄已失去对北军的控制权，想进入未央宫发动政变。

The Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao Cho], galloped [off] and told the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o still feared that [his party] would not be victorious, [so] dared not yet make a public announcement to execute him, but spoke to the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, saying, "Hasten into the Palace to guard the Emperor."

章从勃请卒千人，入未央宫掖门，见产廷中。
刘章请周勃拨兵千人，入未央宫侧门，见吕产在廷中走动。

刘章想夺节，近侍不肯，刘章就与近侍一同乘车，持着皇上符节驰入长乐宫斩杀长乐宫卫尉吕更始。
[Liu] Chang wished to take his credential [from him, but] the Internuncio was unwilling [to part with it]. Then [Liu] Chang went with him in his carriage. By using his credential [as] a passport [allowing him entrance], he galloped [to the Ch`ang-lo Palace] and beheaded the Commandant of the [Palace] Guard at the Chang-lo [Palace], Lü Keng-shih.

大臣相与阴谋，以为少帝及三弟为王者皆非孝惠子，复共诛之，尊立文帝。
大臣们相互进行私谋，认为少帝及他的三个为王的弟弟都不是惠帝的儿子，就一起杀掉，尊立文帝。
The great officials and chancellors planned together secretly; because they considered that the Young Emperor and the kings his three younger brothers were all [in reality] not sons of [the Emperor] Hsiao-hui, [the great officials and chancellors] together executed them and honored and established Emperor Wen [upon the throne].

语在周勃、高五王《传》。
其事记在《汉书·周勃、高五王传》中。
An account [of all the foregoing] is in the "Memoir of Chou P'o" and the "[Memoir of] the Five Kings [who were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]."

赞曰：孝惠、高后之时，海内得离战国之苦，君臣俱欲无为，故惠帝拱己，高后女主制政，不出房闼，而天下晏然，刑罚罕用，民务稼穑，衣食滋殖。
班固评论：汉孝惠帝、高后之时，天下脱离战乱之苦，君臣都想无为而治，所以惠帝垂拱以安天下，高后以妇女主持朝政，不出宫门而天下安泰，刑罚少用，百姓也能专注于耕种，从而丰衣足食。
In eulogy we say: During the times of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], the world had succeeded in putting behind it the sufferings [during the period of] Contending States. Both ruler and subjects sought for effortlessness. Hence although Emperor Hui folded his hands and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], a female lord, assumed the rule and governed without going out of the doors to her apartments, yet the world was quiet, [mutilating] punishments and [other] penalties were seldom used, the people were busy in sowing and harvesting, and clothing and food multiplied and were abundant.
