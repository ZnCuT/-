项籍者，下相人也,字羽。初起时，年二十四。其季父项梁,梁父即楚将项燕，为秦将王翦所戮者也。项氏世世为楚将，封于项,故姓项氏。
项籍是下相人.字羽。开始起事的时候.年方二十四岁。他的小叔叔名叫项梁，项梁的父亲就是被秦将王翦所杀的楚国的名将项燕。项家世世代代在楚国为将，因为有功被封在项这个地方，所以他们就以项为姓了。
XiangJi,whose other name was Yu,was a man of Xiaxiang.He was twenty-four when he first rose in arms.His uncle Xiang Liang was the son of Xiang Yan,a general of Chu who was killed by the Qin general Wang Jian.For many generations the heads of the clan had been enfeoffed in Xiang as generals of Chu;hence Xiang became their family name.

项籍少时，学书不成，去学剑,又不成。项梁怒之。籍曰：“书，足以记名姓而已；剑，一人敌，不足学；学万人敌。”于是项梁乃教籍兵法，籍大喜，略知其意，又不肯竟学。项梁尝有栎阳逮,乃请蕲狱掾曹咎书，抵栎阳狱掾司马欣，以故事得已。项梁杀人，与籍避仇于吴中,吴中贤士大夫皆出项梁下。每吴中有大繇役及丧，项梁常为主办，阴以兵法部勒宾客及子弟，以是知其能。秦始皇帝游会稽，渡浙江，梁与籍俱观。籍曰：“彼可取而代也。”梁掩其口，曰：“毋妄言，族矣!”梁以此奇籍。籍长八尺余,力能扛鼎，才气过人，虽吴中子弟皆已惮籍矣。
项籍小的时候，开始学习写字，学写了一阵不见长进，于是改行另去学剑了，学了一阵仍没有什么成就。项梁为此对他很生气。项籍说：“学了写字也不过是用来记个姓名而已，练好了剑术也不过是能对付一个人，我觉得这些都不值得学。我要学能对付万人的本事。”项梁见他有这份志向，就教他兵法，项籍很高兴，但他仍不过是粗知大意而已，仍是不肯下功夫有始有终地好好学。项梁曾因为犯罪被栎阳县逮捕，他请蕲县的典狱官曹咎给栎阳县的典狱官司马欣写了一封说情的信，因而案子得以了结。后来，项梁又杀了人，在原来的地方住不下去了，只好和项籍一起躲到了吴县。吴县的贤士大夫们对他们叔侄都很佩服敬重，每逢吴县有大的徭役或丧事，总是请项梁来操办，在办这些事的过程中，项梁常常用兵法来组织他手下这些宾客和子弟。因此他很了解这些人，知道他们各自的能力。有一次，秦始皇出游会稽，在渡钱塘江的时候，项梁和项籍都赶去看了，项籍一见秦始皇的那份排场，不由得说道：“这个人的权位可以由我来代替!”项梁一听，赶紧捂住他的嘴，说：“"可别胡说，当心要灭族的!”但是从此他心里也觉得他这个侄子不寻常。项籍身高八尺多，力气超人，双手可以举起大鼎，连吴中土生土长的那些豪门子弟也都很怕他。
As a lad Xiang Yu studied to be a scribe.Failing in this,he took up swordsmanship.When he failed in this too,Xiang Liang was angry with him,but he said: “All scribes do is make lists of names,and swordsmen can only fight a single foe:that is not worth learning.I want to learn how to fight ten thousand foes.” Then,to his great joy,Xiang Liang taught him military strategy.But once he had a general grasp of the subject,Xiang Yu again refused to study to the end. Xiang Liang was arrested at Yueyang,but procured a letter from Cao Jiu,gaoler of Ji,and presented this to Sima Xin,the gaoler of Yueyang,who thereupon let him go.Later Xiang Liang killed a man and fled from vengeance with Xiang Yu to Wu.As all the local figures lacked his ability,Xiang Liang generally took charge of large labour conscriptions or important funerals.And in secret he trained his fol- lowers and young men in the arts of war,to test their abilities.When the First Emperor of Qin crossed the River Zhe on a visit to Kuaiji,Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu looked on. "Why not take over from him?"exclaimed Xiang Yu. “Don't talk so wildly!"said Xiang Liang,stopping his nephew's mouth."Do you want our clan wiped out?"But this sent Xiang Yu up in his estimation. Xiang Yu was over six feet tall and so strong that he could carry a bronze cauldron.He was more brilliant and ambitious than others,so that all the young men in the district stood in awe of him.

秦二世元年七月，陈涉等起大泽中。其九月，会稽守通谓梁曰:“江西皆反，此亦天亡秦之时也。吾闻先即制人，后则为人所制。吾欲发兵，使公及桓楚将。”是时桓楚亡在泽中。梁曰：“桓楚亡，人莫知其处，独籍知之耳。”梁乃出，诫籍持剑居外待。梁复入，与守坐，曰：“请召籍，使受命召桓楚。”守曰：“诺。”梁召籍入。须臾，梁晌籍曰:“可行矣!”于是籍遂拔剑斩守头。项梁持守头，佩其印绶。门下大惊，扰乱，籍所击杀数十百人。一府中皆慑伏,莫敢起。梁乃召故所知豪吏，谕以所为起大事，遂举吴中兵。使人收下县,得精兵八千人。梁部署吴中豪杰为校尉、候、司马。有一人不得用，自言于梁。梁曰：“前时某丧使公主某事，不能办，以此不任用公。”众乃皆伏。于是梁为会稽守，籍为裨将，徇下县。
秦二世元年七月，当陈涉等人在大泽乡宣告起义后，这年的九月，会稽郡守殷通对项梁说：“现在长江以西全部造反，看来是老天爷真要灭掉秦朝了。俗话说先发者制人，后发者就要被人所制。因此我也想起兵，想请您和桓楚给我当将军。”当时桓楚因为犯罪逃亡到大泽中去了。项梁说：“桓楚逃亡在外，没人知道他的下落，只有项籍知道。”说完就出来找到了项籍，让他手提宝剑在外面等着。项梁自己又进去陪着郡守坐了一会儿，然后说：“请您传项籍进来，让他去找桓楚吧。”郡守说：“好的。”于是项梁就把项籍叫了进来。又过了一会儿，项梁给项籍使了个眼色，说：“可以动手了!”于是项籍拔出剑来就砍下了郡守的人头。项梁则拎着郡守的人头，把郡守的印绶佩在自己身上。这时郡守的手下人都吓坏了，纷纷乱作一团。项籍趁势把他们一连杀了近百个，其余的都吓得趴在地上，谁也不敢再动了。项梁把他平日所了解的那些豪强大吏们找来，告诉了他们自己要干的事情，于是就在吴县发兵起义了。接着他就派人去接管了会稽郡下属的各县，征集到了精兵八千人。项梁安排吴县的这些豪杰们去分别担任军中的校尉、军候、司马等职。有一个人没被派到差使，他不服气地找到了项梁，项梁说：“过去办某件丧事的时候，我曾让你去办一件事，结果你没能办好，说明你无能，所以现在不能委派你。”大家听了都很心服。于是项梁自己当了会稽郡郡守，让项籍做他的副将，并以会稽郡守的名义派人到下属各县去宣布命令，安抚民众。
In the seventh month of the first year of the Second Emperor, Chen She and his men rose in Daze.In the ninth month Yin Tong, governor of Kuaiji,summoned Xiang Liang and said: "All the lower reaches of the Yangtse have revolted.Heaven is about to destroy the House of Qin.Whoever strikes first,they say, becomes a leader,while those who delay are led.I want to raise troops with you and Huan Chu as my generals." Huan Chu was then an outlaw in the marshes. "Huan Chu is an outlaw,"replied Xiang Liang,"and no one but Xiang Yu knows whare he is."He withdrew and told Xiang Yu to wait outside with his sword.Then he went back,sat down again by the governor and said,“Please summon Xiang Yu to take your orders to Huan Chu. " When the governor agreed,Xiang Liang called Xiang Yu in.After a moment he glanced at him and said,“The time has come!”Then Xiang Yu drew his sword and cut off the governor's head.Xiang Liang picked up the head and hung Yin Tong's seal and insignia on his own belt.The governor's men panicked and were thrown into confusion. Xiang Yu killed several scores of them.The whole office cowered in terror and no one dared stand against him.Then Xiang Liang sum- moned the chief citizens and some officers whom he knew,gave them his reasons for raising a revolt,and took command of the army of Wu.He sent officers to conscript men from the various districts and gathered a picked force of eight thousand men,appointing the best local men as his lieutenants,scouts and sergeants.One man complained that he had received no post,but Xiang Liang retorted: “When I asked you to see to something at so-and-so's funeral,you let me down.That is why you are being passed over.” All agreed that this was just.Xiang Liang became the governor of Kuaiji with Xiang Yu as his adjutant,and they took over all the districts in that province.

广陵人召平于是为陈王徇广陵,未能下。闻陈王败走,秦兵又且至，乃渡江矫陈王命,拜梁为楚上柱国。曰：“江东已定，急引兵西击秦。”项梁乃以八千人渡江而西。闻陈婴已下东阳,使使欲与连和俱西。陈婴者，故东阳令史,居县中，素信谨，称为长者。东阳少年杀其令,相聚数千人，欲置长，无适用,乃请陈婴。婴谢不能，遂强立婴为长，县中从者得二万人。少年欲立婴便为王，异军苍头特起。陈婴母谓婴曰：“自我为汝家妇，未尝闻汝先古之有贵者。今暴得大名，不祥。不如有所属，事成犹得封侯，事败易以亡，非世所指名也。”婴乃不敢为王。谓其军吏曰：“项氏世世将家，有名于楚。今欲举大事，将非其人不可。我倚名族，亡秦必矣。"于是众从其言，以兵属项梁。项梁渡淮，黥布、蒲将军亦以兵属焉。凡六七万人，军不邳。
这时.广陵人召平正替陈涉南来招抚广陵，广陵人不听。紧跟着召平也听说陈涉已经被秦兵打败逃走了，而秦兵又很快就要来到。于是他就渡过长江来到项梁这里.假传陈王的命令，拜项梁为上柱国，说：“江东现在已经平定，请赶快发兵西进攻秦!”项梁于是率领着部下的八千人渡江西下。这时项梁听说陈婴已经攻下了东阳，于是就派人去和他联络，请他一同联兵西进。陈婴原是东阳县的一个小吏，平时在县里谦谨守信，是有名的老好人。后来当东阳县的青年们杀掉了县令，会集了几千人，想要推举一位县长又找不到合适人选，于是他们就去请陈婴。陈婴推辞说自己干不了，年轻人不听.硬是推他做了县长。这时全县愿意跟着干的已经有两万多人。东阳县的青年们有的便想索性立陈婴为王，不归属任何人，自己来他一个异军突起。陈婴的母亲对陈婴说：“自打我进你们陈家门做媳妇开始，就没听说过你们家祖上出过什么贵人，今天突然得到一个帝王的称号，这是不吉利的。不如去归附于某个人，那样事情成功了可以封侯，事情失败了也容易逃脱，不致成为一个被世人所数落的人。”陈婴一听吓得再也不敢想称王的事了。他对他的那些军官们说：“项家世代为将，名震楚国，现在要想成大事，非他们不可。我们如果能攀附上他们这种名门大族，就一定能够推翻秦朝啦。”于是大家都听他的话，跟着他投奔了项梁。项梁渡过淮水之后，黥布与蒲将军也率兵前来归附了他。项梁这时已有六七万人，驻扎在下邳。
Zhao Ping,a native of Guangling,attacked that city for Chen She but failed to take it.When he heard of Chen She's defeat and flight and of the Qin army's approach,he crossed the Yangtse and,pretending that he was acting on Chen She's orders,conferred on Xiang Liang the title of chief minister of Chu. "You have conquered the land to the east,"he said."Lose no time now but lead your army west against Qin." Xiang Liang at the head of his eight thousand men crossed the river and marched west.When he learned that Chen Ying had taken Dongyang,he sent an envoy to propose that they join forces and advance west together.Chen Ying had been secretary to the magistrate of Dongyang and was respected throughout the county for his integrity. After the young men there killed their magistrate,several thousands of men banded together and looked for a leader.Finding no one suitable, they approached Chen Ying.He declined with the excuse thathe lacked ability,but they finally prevailed on him to take charge and some twenty thousand men of the county followed him.Then the young men wanted to set him up as their king and form a black-turbaned rebel force of their own. Chen Ying's mother told him,"Since I married into your family,I have never heard that any of your ancestors ever attained noble rank.It is not safe to win fame overnight:you would do better to serve as a subordinate.Then if all goes well,you will be made a marquis;if things go badly,you can easily escape because you are not known to all.” So Chen Ying did not venture to become king."The Xiang family has produced generals for several generations,"he told his officers. "They are well known in Chu.If we want to revolt,we must have them on our side.With the help of such a distinguished family,Qin can certainly be destroyed." They took his advice and put their troops under Xiang Liang's command.After Xiang Liang crossed the River Huai,Ying Bu²and General Pu also came over to him with their men.The army,now nearly seventy thousand strong,encamped at Xiapi.

当是时，秦嘉已立景驹为楚王,军彭城东,欲距项梁。项梁谓军吏曰：“陈王先首事,战不利，未闻所在。今秦嘉倍陈王而立景驹,逆无道。”乃进兵击秦嘉。秦嘉军败走，追之至胡陵。嘉还战一日，嘉死，军降。景驹走死梁地。项梁已并秦嘉军，军胡陵，将引军而西。章邯军至栗,项梁使别将朱鸡石、余樊君与战,余樊君死，朱鸡石军败，亡走胡陵。项梁乃引兵入薛，诛鸡石。项梁前使项羽别攻襄城,襄城坚守不下。已拔，皆坑之。还报项梁。项梁闻陈王定死，召诸别将会薛计事。此时沛公亦起沛往焉。
这时，秦嘉已经另立了景驹为楚王，驻军彭城以东，想阻截项梁的军队。项梁对他的部下们说：“陈王是最早起事的，他仅仅在一次作战失利后下落不明，秦嘉就背叛了他，另立景驹为王，真是大逆不道。”于是挥兵进击秦嘉。秦嘉被打败，逃走了。项梁率军追到胡陵，秦嘉又回兵抵抗了一整天。最后秦嘉战死，军队全部投降。景驹逃走后死在了梁地。项梁收编了秦嘉的军队后，驻扎在胡陵，准备继续西征。这时秦将章邯的军队已到了栗县，项梁派部将朱鸡石、余樊君前去迎敌，结果余樊君战死，朱鸡石兵败，逃回了胡陵。于是项梁乃率军移驻薛县，处决了朱鸡石。在此之前，项梁已经派项羽分兵攻打襄城。开始襄城坚守不下，最后被项羽硬攻了下来，项羽一怒把襄城的男女老少全都活埋了。这时项梁已经知道陈王的确是死了，就召集各路将领一齐到薛县商议大事。这时刘邦也以造反的沛县县长的身份前来参加了。
Meanwhile QinJia had madeJingJu king of Chu and stationed his troops east of Pengcheng to block Xiang Liang's way. “Chen She was the first to rise,”said Xiang Liang to his officers. "But since his defeat we do not know what has become of him. Now Qin Jia has turned against him and made JingJu king.This is vile treachery!” He led his men against Qin Jia and put him to flight.Xiang Liang pursued him to Huling,where Qin Jia turned to give battle.At the endof the day Qin Jia was dead and his men had surrendered.Jing Ju fled and perished in the land of Liang. Xiang Liang took over Qin Jia's army and camped at Huling be- fore marching west. By now the Qin army led by Zhang Han had reached Li.Xiang Liang sent his generals ZhuJishi and the lord of Yufan against him;but the lord of Yufan was killed and Zhu Jishi's army,routed,retreated to Huling.Xiang Liang led his men to Xue and killed Zhu Jishi.He had sent Xiang Yu to storm,Xiang Yu put all the defenders to the sword before going back to report to Xiang Liang. When Xiang Liang heard for certain that Chen She was dead,he summoned his generals to Xue for a council.By this time Liu Bang, who had risen in Pei,had joined him.

居郸人范增,年七十，素居家，好奇计。往说项梁曰：“陈胜败固当。夫秦灭六国，楚最无罪。自怀王入秦不反,楚人怜之至今。故楚南公曰:‘楚虽三户，亡秦必楚’也。今陈胜首事，不立楚后而自立，其势不长。今君起江东，楚蜂午之将皆争附君者,以君世世楚将，为能复立楚之后也。”于是项梁然其言，乃求楚怀王孙心,民间为人牧羊,立以为楚怀王,从民所望也。陈婴为楚上柱国，封五县，与怀王都盱台。项梁自号为武信君。
这时居郸人范增已经七十岁了，平素隐居不出，善为奇谋妙算，他前去给项梁出主意说：“陈胜的失败是理所当然的。想当初秦朝灭掉六国的时候.楚国是最无罪的。自从楚怀王被骗到秦国死在那里后.楚国人到今天还非常同情他。楚国的南公曾说过‘即使楚国只剩下了三户人家，将来灭秦的也必然是楚国人'。可是今天陈胜起事时，不立楚国的后代，而自己为王，当然他就长不了。您从江东起兵以来，所以有那么多楚国将领前来归附，就因为你们项家世世代代为楚将，大家相信您能够再次扶立一个楚国的后代。”项梁听范增的话有理，就派人去找来了楚怀王的一个孙子，他名字叫心，当时正流落在民间给人放羊。项梁便立他为王，而且仍称他为楚怀王，为的是顺应当时百姓们的心愿。同时封陈婴为上柱国，并给他五个县作封地，让他陪同楚怀王一起住在国都盱眙。项梁自己号称武信君。
Fan Zeng of Juchao,a man of seventy who held no public office, was a good strategist.Now he went to offer advice to Xiang Liang saying,“Chen She deserved to fall.Of the six kingdoms conquered by Qin,Chu was the most blameless.Ever since KingHuai went to Qin and failed to return,the people of Chu have never ceased to mourn him.That is why Nangong of Chu said,'So long as three households are leftin Chu,she will be the land to overthrow Qin.'But when Chen She rebelled,he set himself up as king instead of one of the House of Chu;thus his power was short-lived.Once you took up arms in the east,men of power in Chu raced to put themselves under your command,because you come of a line of generals of Chu and have it in your power to restore the royal house.”These words convinced Xiang Liang,who had a search made for the late King Huai's grandson Xin,who turned out to be herding sheep among the common people,and set him up as King Huai of Chu to satisfy popular feeling.Chen Ying was appointed his chief minister and given five counties as his fief.King Huai's capital was Xuyi.Xiang Liang himself took the title lord of Wuxin.

居数月，引兵攻亢父,与齐田荣、司马龙且军救东阿,大破秦军于东阿。田荣即引兵归，逐其王假。假亡走楚，假相田角亡走赵。角弟田间故齐将，居赵不敢归。田荣立田儋子市为齐王。项梁已破东阿下军，遂追秦军。数使使趣齐兵，欲与俱西。田荣曰：“楚杀田假，赵杀田角、田间，乃发兵。”项梁曰：“田假为与国之王,穷来从我,不忍杀之。”赵亦不杀田角、田间以市于齐。齐遂不肯发兵助楚。项梁使沛公及项羽别攻城阳,屠之。西破秦军濮阳东，秦兵收入濮阳。沛公、项羽乃攻定陶。定陶未下，去，西略地至雍丘,大破秦军，斩李由。还攻外黄，外黄未下。
休整了几个月之后，项梁率军攻打亢父，接着又与齐国的田荣、楚国的司马龙且合兵援救被秦兵所困的东阿，大败秦军于东阿。东阿解围后，田荣随即引兵东归，驱逐了当时被齐人所立的田假。田假逃到了楚国.田假的宰相田角逃到了赵国。田角的弟弟田间这时正出使在赵国，听到齐国政变后也留在赵国不敢回去了。于是田荣就扶立田儋的儿子田市做了齐王。这时项梁正趁着东阿大捷的余威乘胜追击秦军，他几次派使者来催促田荣，让他出兵一起西进击秦，田荣说：“要是你们楚国能杀掉田假，赵国能杀掉田角、田间，我就出兵。”项梁说：“田假是我们盟国的国君，人家走投无路了来投奔我们，我们怎能忍心杀他呢?”赵国也不愿杀田角、田间来与齐国做交易。于是田荣也就以此为借口拒绝发兵帮助楚国攻秦。不久项梁派刘邦和项羽率兵攻打城阳，攻下后又把全城人都杀了。接着项梁又率兵西进，大破秦军于濮阳城东，秦军收兵退入了濮阳城内。这时刘邦、项羽又率兵转攻定陶，没有攻下，于是刘邦、项羽领兵西去，到达雍丘，在雍丘大破秦军，杀死了秦将李由。接着又回兵攻打外黄，没有攻下。
Some months later he led his army against Kangfu,then joined forces with Tian Rong ofQiand Marshal SimaLongju to relieve Donga, routing the forces of Qin there.Then Tian Rong led his troops back to Qiand drove away KingJia,who fled to Chu.His chief minister Tian Jiao fled to Zhao.Tian Jiao's younger brother Tian Jian,a former gen- eral of Qi,remained in Zhao,not daring to return.Then Tian Rong made Fu,son of Tian Dan,king of Qi.After defeating the forces of Qin at Donga,Xiang Liang set out in pursuit of them and sent several envoys to urge the generals of Qi to advance west with him. Tian Rong's answer was,"We will send troops only if you kill Tian Jia and the king of Zhao kills Tian Jiao and Tian Jian.” “Tian Jia is the king of a friendly state who turned to us in time of need,"objected Xiang Liang.“It would not be right to kill him."Nei- ther would the king of Zhao kill the other two men to please Qi.SoQi sent no troops to aid Chu. Xiang Liang dispatched Liu Bang and Xiang Yuto attack Cheng- yang.They slaughtered all the defenders and advanced west to defeat the Qin army east of Puyang.When the Qin forces withdrew into Puyang,Liu Bang and Xiang Yu attacked Dingtao but failed to take it. They marched west and occupied all the districts up to Yongqiu,where they inflicted another crushing defeat on the forces of Qin and be- headed Li You.They turned back to attack Waihuang,but could not take it.

项梁起东阿，西，比至定陶，再破秦军；项羽等又斩李由，益轻秦,有骄色。宋义乃谏项梁曰:“战胜而将骄卒惰者败，今卒少惰矣,秦兵日益,臣为君畏之。”项梁弗听，乃使宋义使于齐。道遇齐使者高陵君显，曰：“公将见武信君乎!”曰：“然。”曰：“臣论武信君军必败。公徐行即免死，疾行则及祸。”秦果悉起兵益章邯，击楚军，大破之定陶，项梁死。沛公、项羽去外黄攻陈留,陈留坚守不能下。沛公、项羽相与谋曰：“今项梁军破，士卒恐。”乃与吕臣俱引兵而东。吕臣军彭城东，项羽军彭城西，沛公军砀。
自从项梁率兵从东阿乘胜西进到达定陶后，一连几次大破秦军。再加上项羽那边又杀了李由，因此他就越来越瞧不起秦军，越来越骄傲起来。宋义见此情形就劝导项梁说：“刚打了一个胜仗，假如为将的就因此骄傲，当兵的就因此松懈，那以后就非败不可。现在我们的士兵已经开始松懈了，而秦朝的援兵则越来越多，我觉得这个局面是可怕的。”项梁不听，他找了一个借口打发宋义出使去齐国了。宋义在半道上正好遇到了齐国派往楚国来的使者高陵君显，宋义问他：“您这是要去见武信君吗?”高陵君说：“是的。”宋义说：“我估计武信君的军队很快要失败，您要是慢点儿走，可能就不至遇难。你要是走得太快，说不定会遭受杀身之祸。”结果，恰如宋义所料，秦朝真的调集了所有的兵力增援章邯，突然对项梁发起了攻击，大破楚军于定陶，项梁战死。刘邦、项羽也只好离开外黄，转攻陈留。陈留也难以攻下，刘邦、项羽两人合计说：“现在项梁的大部队被敌人打败，我们的军心已经动摇了。”于是他们便和吕臣等一起引兵向东撤退。最后吕臣的军队驻扎在彭城东，项羽的部队驻扎在彭城西，刘邦的部队驻扎在砀县。
Meanwhile Xiang Liang had set out from Donga and marched northwest to Dingtao,where once again he defeated the forces of Qin;and now that Xiang Yu and the others had beheaded Li You,he began to underestimate Qin and to grow arrogant. Song Yi warned him,“A general who is arrogant and soldiers who slack off after a victory are sure to be defeated.Now your troops are taking it easy while the Qin army grows stronger every day.Iam wor- ried to think what will become of you.” Xiang Liang paid no attention,but sent Song Yias his envoy toQi. On the way Song Yimet Qi's envoy,Lord Xian of Gaoling. "Are you going to see the lord of Wuxin(Xiang Liang)?"he asked him.The other replied,"I am." "I can tell you,"said Song Yi,"that the lord ofWuxin is sure to be defeated.If you travel slowly,you may escape with your life.If you hurry,you will run into trouble." All Qin's men were mobilized to reinforce Zhang Han,who at- tacked and routed the Chu army at Dingtao and killed Xiang Liang. Liu Bang and Xiang Yu had left Waihuang to attack Chenliu,but the city was stubbornly defended and could not be taken.So they took counsel together.“"Now that Xiang Liang's army has been routed,our men are scared," they said. They decided to go east with Lü Chen's troops.Lü Chen encamped east of Pengcheng,Xiang Yu west of Pengcheng and Liu Bang at Dang.

章邯已破项梁军，则以为楚地兵不足忧，乃渡河击赵,大破之。当此时，赵歇为王，张耳为相，皆走人巨鹿城。章邯令王离、涉间围巨鹿,章邯军其南，筑甬道而输之粟。陈馀为将，将卒数万人而军巨鹿之北，此所谓“河北”之军也。
章邯打败项梁的军队后，就觉得对楚地的起义军不用太担心了。于是他就渡过黄河，来攻击北方的赵国。赵国仓促应战，被章邯打得大败。这时候，赵歇是赵国的国王，张耳是赵国的宰相，他们都退进了巨鹿城内。章邯命令王离、涉间二将领兵将巨鹿团团围住，他自己率大军驻扎在巨鹿的南面，中间修筑了一条甬道互相连接，从甬道给王离、涉间输送粮草。而陈馀是赵国的将军，他率领着几万人驻扎在巨鹿的城北，这就是当时人们所说的“河北”之军。
After defeating Xiang Liang,Zhang Han thought he had nothing to fear from the other Chu forces.He crossed the Yellow River to attack Zhao and routed its army completely.Zhao Xie,the king of Zhao,fled with his general Chen Yuand his chief minister Zhang Er to the city of Julu.Zhang Han ordered Wang Li and She Jian to besiege the city,while he stationed his own army to the south and constructed a fortified road to supply them with grain.The Zhao commander Chen Yu camped with several tens of thousands of men north of the city.This force was known as the Army North of the River.

楚兵已破于定陶，怀王恐，从盱台之彭城,并项羽、吕臣军自将之。以吕臣为司徒，以其父吕青为令尹,以沛公为砀郡长，封为武安侯，将砀郡兵。
再说楚国自从项梁的军队在定陶被章邯击破后，楚怀王感到很惶恐，于是他自己从盱眙前进到了彭城，他把项羽、吕臣的军队收过来，归自己统领。改任吕臣为司徒，任吕臣的父亲吕青为令尹，让刘邦为砀郡的郡长，封他为武安侯，让他统领砀郡的军队。
After the defeat of the Chu army at Dingtao,King Huai of Chu took fright and moved from Xuyi to Pengcheng,where he combined the forces of Xiang Yu and Lü Chen under his own command.He appointed Lü Chen his chief commissary and his father LüQing prime minister.Liu Bang he made governor of Dang and marquis of Wuan, in command of the troops of Dang.

初,宋义所遇齐使者高陵君显在楚军，见楚王曰:“宋义论武信君之军必败，居数日，军果败。兵未战而先见败征，此可谓知兵矣。”王召宋义与计事而大说之，因置以为上将军;项羽为鲁公，为次将；范增为末将,救赵。诸别将皆属宋义,号为卿子冠军。行至安阳,留四十六日不进。项羽曰：“吾闻秦军围赵王巨鹿，疾引兵渡河，楚击其外，赵应其内，破秦军必矣。”宋义曰：“不然。夫搏牛之虻不可以破虮虱。今秦攻赵，战胜则兵罢,我承其敝；不胜，则我引兵鼓行而西四，必举秦矣。故不如先斗秦赵"。夫被坚执锐,义不如公；坐而运策，公不如义。”因下令军中曰：“猛如虎，很如羊，贪如狼，强不可使者，皆斩之。”乃遣其子宋襄相齐，身送之至无盐.饮酒高会。天寒大雨，士卒冻饥。项羽曰：“将戮力而攻秦,久留不行；今岁饥民贫，士卒食芋菽,军无见粮，乃饮酒高会；不引兵渡河因赵食，与赵并力攻秦，乃曰‘承其敝’。夫以秦之强，攻新造之赵，其势必举赵。赵举而秦强，何敝之承!且国兵新破，王坐不安席，扫境内而专属于将军，国家安危，在此一举。今不恤士卒而徇其私，非社稷之臣。”项羽晨朝上将军宋义,即其帐中斩宋义头，出令军中曰：“宋义与齐谋反楚,楚王阴令羽诛之。”当是时，诸将皆慑服，莫敢枝梧。皆曰：“首立楚者，将军家也。今将军诛乱。”乃相与共立羽为假上将军四。使人追宋义子，及之齐,杀之。使桓楚报命于怀王。怀王因使项羽为上将军,当阳君、蒲将军皆属项羽。
再说当初宋义出使齐国时半路上遇见的齐国的使者高陵君显，这时正在楚国的兵营中。他对楚怀王说：“宋义早就预言过武信君必败，结果没过几天，武信君果然失败了。还没有打仗，就能先看出他失败的征兆，这真可以说是懂得用兵之道了。”楚怀王一听，立即派人把宋义找了来，和他谈论了一回，心里很高兴，便任命他为上将军；封项羽为鲁公，让他为次将；让范增为末将，派他们一起率兵救赵。还有其他的一些将领，楚怀王也通通把他们划到了宋义的部下，使得宋义尊宠无比，号称卿子冠军。当这支军队前进到安阳的时候，忽然停下来不走了。而且一停就是四十六天。项羽对宋义说：“现在赵王正被秦军围困于巨鹿，我们应该赶紧率兵渡河，这样我们从外向里打，赵军从里向外接应，就绝对可以打败秦军。”宋义说：“不对，牛虻是用来蜇牛的，而不是为了对付那些虱子。现在秦兵正在攻打赵国，如果打赢了，那他们自己也必然落得个疲惫不堪。到那时我们再乘机收拾他们；如果败了，我们就可以凭着这完好无损的实力大摇大摆地长驱西进.可以一下子端掉秦朝的老窝了。所以目前我们不如先让秦、赵两方互相火并。论冲锋陷阵，我比不上您；要说到筹谋划策，您就不如我了。”说罢宋义就命令全军：“凡是凶猛、执拗、贪婪、顽固而不听使唤的，一律斩首。”而后又派他的儿子宋襄到齐国去做宰相，他还亲自把他一直送到无盐县，并在那里大摆筵席。而当时天气很冷，又下着大雨，士兵们都又冷又饿。项羽对左右的人们说：“现在最重要的事情是集中一切力量与秦兵作战，可是我们却长期在这里停留不前。现在年荒人穷，士兵们吃的都是山芋野菽，军中连一点存粮都没有。可是作为将军的宋义还在那里大摆筵席，不赶紧领兵渡河到赵国就地取粮，和赵国合力攻秦，却说什么‘要等秦军的疲惫不堪'!让如此强大的秦军去攻打一个新建不久的赵国，那是肯定要把赵国端掉的。赵国一被端掉，秦军就会变得更强大，还有什么疲惫不堪的机会等着我们去乘啊!再说我们楚国的军队刚刚失败不久，我们的怀王急得坐立不安，他把我们全国的军队集中起来都交给了上将军一个人，我们整个国家的安危就决定在这次行动上。可是我们的上将军现在竟然完全不体恤士兵，只顾徇他的私情，他不是一个忠于国家的人!”于是他就趁着清早参见宋义的机会.在大帐中把宋义杀了。然后提着人头出来对全军说：“宋义勾结齐国，企图谋反，怀王秘密命令我.让我把他杀掉。”这时所有的将领都被吓得服服帖帖，没有一个人敢抗拒。大家都说：“当初第一个拥立怀王的，就是您项家，现在您又为楚国杀掉了乱臣!”于是大家一致推举项羽代行上将军的职权。项羽为了斩草除根，就派人追踪到齐国，把宋义的儿子宋襄也杀掉了。待一切安排停当后.项羽才派了桓楚去向怀王报告这件事情的过程。怀王无法，只好顺水推舟地任命项羽做了上将军.让当阳君、蒲将军等各个将领都归项羽统辖。
Lord Xian of Gaoling,Qi's envoy whom Song Yi had once met and who was in the Chu army,informed King Huai,“Song Yi pre- dicted the lord of Wuxin's defeat,and a few days later his army was indeed routed.Here is a man who understands warfare,who foresees defeat before a battle is fought.” King Huai summoned Song Yi for a talk and was so impressed that he appointed him commander-in-chief to rescue Zhao,and made Xiang Yu the duke ofLu and his second in command with Fan Zeng as third in command.All the other generals took orders from Song Yi,whose title was Lord Chief Marshal.They marched to Anyang and camped there for forty-six days without advancing. "I hear that Qin is besieging the king of Zhao at Julu,"said Xiang Yu."If we cross the river quickly and attack from outside while the men of Zhao strike from within,we are bound to defeat the Qin army." "No,"objected Song Yi.“A gadfly which can sting a bull may not be able to kill a flea.Now Qin is attacking Zhao.If her men win they will be exhausted and we can take advantage of their weakness.If they lose we can march west with sounding drums and will certainly defeat them.Better let Qin and Zhao fight it out first.In feats of arms Iam no match for you,but in strategy you are no match for me." Then he issued this order to the troops:“Any man who is fierce as a tiger,stubborn as a sheep,greedy as a wolf,or disobedient to orders, will lose his head.” He appointed his son Song Xiang chief minister to the king of Qi and saw him to Wuyan,where he gave a banquet.The day was raw,a heavy rain was falling,and the men were hungry and cold. Xiang Yu reflected,"Instead of hitting out hard at Qin,he has made us stay here all this time without moving.The harvest has failed, the people are destitute,and for lack of grain our men are eating taros and beans;yet he holds a great banquet!Instead of leading our troops across the river to get food from Zhao and join forces with Zhao to attack the enemy,he claims he is waiting for Qin to be exhausted.In fact,Qin is so powerful that if she attacks the newly formed state of Zhao,she is bound to defeat it.Once Zhao falls,Qin will grow even stronger.There will be no exhaustion for us to profit by.Besides,our men have recently been defeated,our king sits uneasy on his throne and has put all the resources of the kingdom at the command of Song Yi.Our whole country's future is at stake.Yet instead of caring for his troops,Song Yi attends to private affairs.He is betraying our coun- try.” So one morning when he went to pay his respects to the marshal he entered Song Yi's tent and cut off his head.Coming out he an- nounced to the army,"Song Yi was plotting with Qi against our state. King Huai sent me secret orders to execute him.” At this all the generals were awed into submission."Your family first established our state,"they said."Now you have killed a traitor.” They made Xiang Yu their acting commander-in-chief and sent men to Qi to capture and killSong Yis son.General Huan Chu was sent to report this to King Huai,who appointed Xiang Yu as commander-in- chief with the lord of Dangyang and General Pu under him.

项羽已杀卿子冠军，威震楚国，名闻诸侯。乃遣当阳君、蒲将军将卒二万渡河,救巨鹿。战少利,陈馀复请兵。项羽乃悉引兵渡河，皆沉船，破釜甑，烧庐舍,持三日粮，以示士卒必死，无一还心。于是至则围王离，与秦军遇，九战，绝其甬道，大破之,杀苏角，虏王离。涉间不降楚，自烧杀。
项羽杀了卿子冠军宋义以后，威震楚国，名闻天下。于是项羽就派当阳君、蒲将军率领两万人立刻渡河救赵。二将过河后，初步取得了一些胜利。陈馀不满足，继续向项羽请求援助。于是项羽下令全军渡河。过河后，项羽下令把全部船只沉入河底，把锅碗都砸了，把帐篷一律烧掉，只带着三天的粮食，以此来向士兵们表示一种只有前进绝不能后退的决心。楚军一到巨鹿，就立即包围了王离的部队，随即与秦军开战，经过多次战斗，终于冲断了秦军的甬道，接着大破秦军，杀死了苏角，俘虏了王离。涉间不投降，自焚而死。
By killing the Lord Chief Marshal Song Yi,Xiang Yu struck terror into the whole of Chu and his fame spread to other states.He sent the lord of Dangyang and General Pu across the river with twenty thou- sand men to raise the siege ofJulu.As they met with little success,Chen Yu asked for reinforcements.Thereupon Xiang Yu led his entire force across the river.They sank all their boats,smashed their cooking vessels, burned their huts,and carried only three day's rations with them to show their determination to fight to the death and never to turn back.They besieged Wang Li's troops,fought nine battles with the Qin army, cut its supply route and defeated it utterly.The Qin general SuJiao was killed,Wang Li captured,and She Jian who refused to surrender per- ished in the fire.

当是时，楚兵冠诸侯。诸侯军救巨鹿者十余壁,莫敢纵兵。及楚击秦，诸将皆从壁上观。楚战士无不一以当十，楚兵呼声动天，诸侯军无不人人惴恐。于是已破秦军，项羽召见诸侯将，诸侯将入辕门,无不膝行而前，莫敢仰视。项羽由是始为诸侯上将军，诸侯皆属焉。
在两军交战的时候，楚兵英勇无比。当时各地来援救巨鹿的军队有十几座大营，但是没有一处敢出来与秦军作战。等到项羽的军队与秦军开战了，这些各路援军的将领们都一个个站在营垒上远远观望。楚军的战士们无不以一当十，杀声震天。其他各路援军见到这种情景，一个个都吓得胆战心惊。等到楚军击败了秦军之后，项羽召见各路的将领，这些将领们进辕门的时候，一个个都是跪在地上，用膝盖挪着进去的，谁也不敢抬起头来往上看一眼。从此项羽便成了诸侯们共同的上将军。各路诸侯都归项羽统辖。
By now the army of Chu outmatched all others.Ten or more armies from different states had entrenched themselves outsideJulu to rescue the city,but none had dared take the field.When Chu attacked Qin,the others watched from their ramparts.Each soldier of Chu was a match for ten of the enemy.Their war-cries rent the sky,striking terror into the hearts of all who heard them.Thus when they defeated Qin and Xiang Yu summoned the other generals to his camp,they entered on their knees and none dared look up.Then Xiang Yu be- came commander-in-chief of the forces of these different states and their leaders took orders from him.

章邯军棘原,项羽军漳南,相持未战。秦军数却，二世使人让章邯。章邯恐，使长史欣请事。至咸阳,留司马门三日,赵高不见，有不信之心。长史欣恐，还走其军，不敢出故道。赵高果使人追之，不及。欣至军，报曰：“赵高用事于中，下无可为者。今战能胜，高必疾妒吾功；战不能胜，不免于死。愿将军孰计之。”
这时，章邯的大营驻扎在棘原，项羽的大营驻扎在漳南。两军对峙，尚未正式开战，但是秦军已经连连地向后退却了，这种形势使秦二世大为恼火，于是他专门派了一名使者来斥责章邯。章邯很害怕，便派长史司马欣去到朝中说明原委，请求指示。司马欣到达咸阳后，在司马门一连等了三天，赵高不接见，表现出了对他们不信任的意思。司马欣非常害怕，马上离开咸阳逃回了自己的军队。他怕赵高追他，所以没有从旧路上走。结果赵高真的派人去追了，只是没追上。司马欣赶回军中，向章邯报告说：“只要有赵高在朝里专权，下面的人就别想干得成事。如今的仗我们要是打胜了，赵高就会嫉妒我们的功劳；要是打败了，我们就都将被赵高所杀。所以我们的事情，您还得好好考虑考虑。”
Zhang Han's army at Jiyuan and Xiang Yu's army south of the River Zhang confronted each other for some time without fighting. Because the Qin army had several times retreated,the Second Em- peror sent an envoy to censure Zhang Han.Then the latter dispatched his secretary Sima Xin in alarm to Xianyang to ask for instructions. Three days Sima Xin waited outside the palace gate,but Zhao Gao would not see him as he did not trust him.At that Sima Xin was afraid and returned to the army by a differet route.The pursuers Zhao Gao sent after him failed to overtake him.Back with the army,Sima Xin reported,"With Zhao Gao in control there is nothing we can do.If we fight and win,he will envy our success.If we lose,he will have us killed.I hope you will think this over carefully.”

陈馀亦遗章邯书曰：“白起为秦将,南征鄢郢,北坑马服，攻城略地，不可胜计，而竟赐死。蒙恬为秦将，北逐戎人，开榆中地数千里，竟斩阳周。何者?功多，秦不能尽封，因以法诛之。今将军为秦将三岁矣，所亡失以十万数，而诸侯并起滋益多。彼赵高素谀日久，今事急,亦恐二世诛之，故欲以法诛将军以塞责，使人更代将军以脱其祸。夫将军居外久，多内隙,有功亦诛，无功亦诛。且天之亡秦，无愚智皆知之。今将军内不能直谏，外为亡国将，孤特独立而欲常存，岂不哀哉!将军何不还兵与诸侯为从，约共攻秦，分王其地，南面称孤?此孰与身伏铁质妻子为缪乎?”章邯狐疑，阴使候始成使项羽，欲约。约未成，项羽使蒲将军日夜引兵度三户，军漳南”,与秦战，再破之。项羽悉引兵击秦军汗水上,大破之"。
这时赵国的陈馀也写了一封信对章邯说：“当初白起为秦国当将军，向南攻克了楚国的鄢郢，向北活埋了赵括的军队四十万人，攻城拓地，数量多得没法计算，结果竞落了个赐死；蒙恬在秦国当将军，向北驱逐了匈奴，为秦国开拓了榆中一带地盘几千里，而最后竟落得个在阳周被杀。这都是为什么呢?就是因为他们的功劳太大，秦朝没有办法再封赏他们，所以就找个借口把他们杀了。现在您为秦朝当将军也已经三年了，您在各次战争中折损的人马已经有几十万了，而各地诸侯纷纷起义，造反的人越来越多。赵高在朝里一贯用花言巧语讨好皇上，现在国家的形势危急到这种地步，他也怕皇上杀他。他为了推脱罪责，免除祸难，就会想办法把您杀掉，而另派一个人来代替您。您带兵在外时间已经很长了，你和朝里的人们也有许多矛盾。这样下去，您必然是有功也得被杀，没功也得被杀。况且老天爷要灭亡秦朝，这是无论多么傻的人也看得出来的。现在您对内不能做一个直言敢谏的大臣，在外又做了个连打败仗的将领，您孤立一人，无依无靠，还想长期保全，这办得到吗?您为什么还不转过身来与东方的诸侯们互相联合，一起去攻打秦朝呢?您和大家一道灭掉秦朝，瓜分土地，自己也来个南面称王，这和您那种白白送死、全家被杀相比，究竟哪条路子好呢?”章邯见信后犹豫不决，但他暗中也派了军候始成去见项羽，想要和他谈判定盟，结果没有谈成。于是项羽就派蒲将军日夜兼程，带兵渡过了三户津，来到了漳水南岸。蒲将军与秦军接战，秦军又失败了。于是项羽全军出动，在汗水上对秦军发起总攻，结果把秦军打得一败涂地。
Chen Yu sent Zhang Han a letter,saying: "When BaiQi was a general of Qin,he conquered Yan and Ying in the south and wiped out the army of the lord of Mafu in the north. He captured cities and territories past counting,yet at last he was or- dered to die.Meng Tian,another general of Qin,drove away the Huns in the north and extended the territory of his state by several thousand square li;yet in the end his head was cut off at Yangzhou.Why was this?Because their achievements were too great for Qin to reward with fiefs large enough;hence some legal pretext was found for their execu- tion.” "Now you have been a general of Qin for three years and lost hundreds of thousands of men,while rebellions in the different states are becoming more frequent.Zhao Gao has deceived and flattered the emperor so long that now the position is desperate he wants to make you a scapegoat to avoid being executed himself.He will take away your command to save his own skin. "You have long been absent from the capital and have many en- emies at court.You will be executed whether you win battles or not. Besides,Qin is destined to fall—wise and foolish alike can see that. Now you have no voice in the government,and if you remain at the front you will soon have no country of your own.Alone and unfriended you are,alas,doomed!Why not turn your army back and ally with the other states to attack Qin and divide the empire between you?Then you can be a king and reign supreme.This is surely better than dying by the axe and bringing destruction upon your own wife and children.” Zhang Han began to waver and secretly sent his officer Shi Cheng as an envoy to seek for some agreement with Xiang Yu.Beforea agreement was reached,Xiang Yu dispatched General Pu with troops to cross Sanhu ford by night to the south bank of the River Zhang, where Pu attacked and defeated the army of Qin.Then Xiang Yu led his entire force against the Qin troops on the bank of the River Yuand completely routed them.

章邯使人见项羽，欲约。项羽召军吏谋曰：“粮少，欲听其约。”军吏皆曰：“善。”项羽乃与期洹水南殷虚上。已盟，章邯见项羽而流涕，为言赵高。项羽乃立章邯为雍王，置楚军中。使长史欣为上将军，将秦军为前行。
章邯无奈，只好又派人去见项羽，请求订立盟约。项羽召集他的部下们一道商量，说：“眼下我们的粮草太少，我想接受他们的请求。”部下们都一齐说：“好。”于是项羽约了一个时间在洹水南岸的殷墟上与章邯见了面。双方签好盟约后，章邯流着眼泪向项羽诉说了赵高专权害人的情景。于是项羽就封章邯为雍王.把他留在自己的军中，而封章邯的长史司马欣为上将军，让他统领着章邯的军队在前头给自己开路。
When Zhang Han sent another envoy to seek foran agreement,Xiang Yu summoned his officers to discuss the matter.“Our food supply is low"he said."We had better accept his offer.” When his officers approved,Xiang Yu appointed a time to meet Zhang Han on the ruins of the old capital of Yin south of the River Huan,and there they reached an agreement.Zhang Han told Xiang Yu with tears what Zhao Gao had done,and Xiang Yu made him king of Yong and kept him in the Chu army.His secretary Sima Xin was ap- pointed marshal of the Qin troops to lead them ahead of the main army to Xin'an.

到新安。诸侯吏卒异时故繇使屯戍过秦中,秦中吏卒遇之多无状;及秦军降诸侯，诸侯吏卒乘胜多奴虏使之,轻折辱秦吏卒。秦吏卒多窃言曰：“章将军等诈吾属降诸侯，今能入关破秦，大善；即不能,诸侯虏吾属而东,秦必尽诛吾父母妻子。”诸将微闻其计,以告项羽。项羽乃召黥布、蒲将军计曰：“秦吏卒尚众，其心不服，至关中不听四，事必危。不如击杀之，而独与章邯、长史欣、都尉翳人秦。”于是楚军夜击坑秦卒二十余万人新安城南。
他们西进到新安。过去一些当兵服徭役的东方人，以前路过关中地区的时候，关中的吏卒总是歧视虐待他们；现在秦兵投降了东方诸侯，于是东方的官兵们也就乘着机会反过来把他们看作奴隶，随随便便地凌辱他们。这些秦国的士兵们有的就在下面悄悄议论说：“章将军骗着我们投降了东方诸侯，现在和东方诸侯一道去打关中。如果我们真能打进关去灭了秦朝，那当然是很好了；如果进不了关、灭不了秦，那时诸侯们就会裹挟着咱们一起回他们东方去，到那时秦朝就必然要把我们的父母妻儿统统杀光了。”这些话渐渐地传到了楚军将领的耳朵里，他们立刻报告了项羽。项羽立刻把黥布、蒲将军召来说：“现在秦军的人数是很多的，他们对我们也不服气，等到进关后他们万一不听指挥，那局面就危险了。不如现在就把他们全杀了，只留下章邯、司马欣和董翳三个人，带着他们一起进关。”于是当夜就命令楚军在新安城南把二十几万秦朝降兵统统活埋了。
Before this,the frontier garrisons conscripted from the eastern states had often received rough treatment at the hands of the soldiers of Qin when they passed through their territory.Now that the Qin forces had surrendered,the triumphant soldiers of the other states took their re- venge by treating them as slaves and captives,humiliating and abusing them. The men of Qin whispered among themselves,"Our commander Zhang Han tricked us into surrendering.If we enter the Pass and conquer Qin,well and good.But if we fail,they will send us east as captives and Qin will kill our parents,wives and children." Xiang Yu's generals heard this talk and reported it,whereupon he summoned the lord of Dangyang and General Pu.“Qin's officers and men are still a large force,"he said,“and in their hearts they have not submitted to us.Once inside the Pass,any disobedience would be dangerous.Before we enter Qin we had better kill them all but Zhang Han,Sima Xin his secretary,and Dong Yi his lieutenant.” So the Chu army attacked by night and massacred more than two hundred thousand Qin troops south of Xin’an.

行略定秦地,函谷关有兵守关，不得入。又闻沛公已破咸阳，项羽大怒，使当阳君等击关。项羽遂入,至于戏西。沛公军霸上,未得与项羽相见。沛公左司马曹无伤使人言于项羽曰：“沛公欲王关中，使子婴为相，珍宝尽有之。”项羽大怒，曰：“旦日飨士卒，为击破沛公军!”当是时，项羽兵四十万，在新丰鸿门”,沛公兵十万，在霸上。范增说项羽曰：“沛公居山东时,贪于财货，好美姬。今入关，财物无所取，妇女无所幸，此其志不在小。吾令人望其气，皆为龙虎，成五采，此天子气也，急击勿失。”
接着项羽就要去攻取秦国的本土。军队前进到函谷关，发现函谷关有兵把守，进不去。这时项羽又听说刘邦已经进入咸阳，项羽大怒，他命令当阳君对函谷关发起攻击。函谷关很快被攻下了，于是项羽长驱直入，到达了戏水西岸。这时刘邦正带领人马驻扎在霸上，还没有和项羽见面。而刘邦的左司马曹无伤却派人给项羽通风报信说：“刘邦打算在关中称王，让秦朝的降王子婴给他当宰相，把秦朝的一切财宝都据为己有。”项羽一听，勃然大怒，说：“明早让士兵们饱餐一顿，我们收拾刘邦的军队!”这时候，项羽有四十万人，驻扎在新丰县的鸿门。刘邦有十万人，驻扎在霸上。项羽的谋士范增对项羽说：“刘邦在山东老家的时候，又贪财又好色。现在进了关，居然财物也不贪了，妇女也不要了，由此可见他的野心不小。我让人观望他上空的云气，一片片都成为龙虎的五彩形象，这是该做皇帝的征兆。必须赶紧消灭他，万万不可错过了机会。”
They advanced conquering the land of Qin till they found their way barred by a force defending the Hangu Pass,which they were unable to storm.When word came that Liu Bang,lord of Pei,had already taken Xianyang,Xiang Yu flew into a passion.He made the lord of Dangyang and others storm the Pass and followed them to a place west of the River Xi. Liu Bang's army was now at Bashang.Before he could meet with Xiang Yu,his left marshal Cao Wushang sent Xiang Yu this message: "The lord of Pei intends to be king inside the Pass,with Ziying³as his prime minister.He will keep all the jewels and treasures for himself.” In a rage Xiang Yu swore,"Tomorrow I shall feast my men,and then we will attack and smash Liu Bang's army!"” Xiang Yu then had four hundred thousand men encamped at Hongmen near Xinfeng,and Liu Bang had one hundred thousand at Bashang. Fan Zeng also told Xiang Yu,"When the lord of Pei was living east of the mountains,he was greedy for wealth and fond of beautiful women;but since entering the Pass he has taken neither loot nor women. This shows that he aims high.I sent men to watch the heavenly signs above his camp.They are off all colours and shaped like dragons and tigers—the signs of a Son of Heaven.You must lose no time in attacking him!”

楚左尹项伯者,项羽季父也,素善留侯张良。张良是时从沛公。项伯乃夜驰之沛公军，私见张良，具告以事，欲呼张良与俱去。曰：“毋从俱死也。”张良曰：“臣为韩王送沛公,沛公今事有急，亡去不义，不可不语。”良乃入，具告沛公。沛公大惊，曰：“为之奈何?”张良曰：“谁为大王为此计者?”曰：“鲰生说我曰：‘距关毋内诸侯，秦地可尽王也。'故听之。”良曰：“料大王士卒足以当项王乎?”沛公默然，曰“固不如也，且为之奈何?”张良曰：“请往谓项伯，言沛公不敢背项王也。”沛公曰：“君安与项伯有故?”张良曰：“秦时与臣游，项伯杀人，臣活之。今事有急，故幸来告良。”沛公曰“孰与君少长?”良曰：“长于臣。”沛公曰：“君为我呼入，吾得兄事之。”张良出，要项伯。项伯即入见沛公。沛公奉卮酒为寿,约为婚姻,曰：“吾入关，秋豪不敢有所近四，籍吏民,封府库，而待将军。所以遣将守关者，备他盗之出入与非常也。日夜望将军至，岂敢反乎!愿伯具言臣之不敢倍德也。”项伯许诺。谓沛公曰：“旦日不可不蚤自来谢项王。”沛公曰：“诺。”于是项伯复夜去，至军中，具以沛公言报项王。因言曰：“沛公不先破关中，公岂敢入乎?今人有大功而击之，不义也。不如因善遇之。”项王许诺。
楚国的左尹项伯是项羽的叔叔.他早就和张良相好。而张良这时正跟着刘邦。项伯听说项羽明早就要消灭刘邦，于是就在当夜偷偷地飞马疾驰到刘邦的军营.去找张良。他急急忙忙地把情况对张良说了一遍，就要拉着张良一道逃走。他说：“你不要跟着刘邦一起死了。”张良说：“我是为着韩王才跟着刘邦到这里来的，现在刘邦有了难，我一声不吭独自逃跑，也太不仗义了。我不能不告诉他。”说罢进去，把项羽的计划一一地对刘邦讲了一遍。刘邦一听大惊，说：“这可怎么办呢?”张良说：“把住函谷关，不让项羽进来，这是谁的主意?”刘邦说：“有个无知的小子对我说‘把住函谷关.不让别的诸侯进来，您就可以全部地占有秦国的地盘而称王’。所以我就听了他的话。”张良说：“大王自己估计，我们的军队可以敌得过项羽吗?”刘邦半天不作声，过了好久才说：“当然敌不过了，那么咱们该怎么办吧!”张良说：“那就请你允许我出去告诉项伯，说您从来没敢背叛项王。”刘邦问张良：“你怎么跟项伯认识?”张良说：“以前在秦朝的时候，我和项伯是朋友，项伯杀了人，我曾掩护过他，救过他的命。所以现在有了紧急情况，他来给我送信。”刘邦突然问道：“您和他谁的年纪大?”张良说：“他比我大。”刘邦说：“好，您马上请他进来，我要用对待兄长的礼节对待他。”于是张良出来把项伯请了进去。刘邦一见项伯，立刻端起酒杯向他敬酒，祝他健康长寿，并和他约定做了儿女亲家。刘邦说：“自从我进关以来，就恭候着项将军的到来，没敢动关中的一草一木，我登记好了吏民的户口，封起了一切大小仓库。我之所以派兵把守函谷关，是为了防备土匪强盗以及其他的事故。我日夜盼望着项将军驾到，怎么敢有别的心呢!请您回去在项将军面前把我这份心思替我说说。”项伯答应了，并对刘邦说：“明天一早您要早点儿亲自去向项将军赔罪。”刘邦说：“是。”于是项伯又连夜赶回了项羽的大营。回营后，他把刘邦的话一五一十地报告了项羽，并接着说：“如果不是人家刘邦先攻入关中，您今天能够这么容易地进来吗?现在人家有这么大的功劳，我们却要去打人家.这不是太不仗义了吗?我看我们不如就此好好地对待他。”项王听着有理，就答应了。
Xiang Yu's uncle Xiang Bo,the vice-chancellor of Chu,was a friend of Zhang Liang,marquis of Liu,then in the service of Liu Bang. Xiang Bo galloped in secret toLiu Bang's camp that night to visit Zhang Liang and tell him what had happened.He urged Zhang Liang to go away with him. “Othewise you will perish!”he warned him. But Zhang Liang replied,“The king of Han⁴(403B.C.-230B.C.) sent me here with the lord of Pei.It would not be right to desert him in the hour of danger.I must report this to him.” He went in and related everything to Liu Bang "What shall I do?"asked Liu Bang in great alarm. "Who advised you to take this course?"inquired Zhang Liang. "A fool of a scholar advised me to hold the Pass and not let the others in,for then I should be able to rule all Qin.I followed his plan." "Do you think,my lord,that your troops can stand up to Xiang Yu?” “Of course not,"answered Liu Bang after a pause."But what shall I do?” "Let me tell Xiang Bo that the lord of Pei dares not oppose Xiang Yu.”"How do you happen to know Xiang Bo?" “We became acquainted in the time of Qin,andI saved Xiang Bo's life once when he killed a man.Now that we are in danger,he was good enough to come and warn me." "Which of you is the elder?" "He is." "Please ask him in.I shall treat him as I would an elder brother." Zhang Liang brought Xiang Bo in to see Liu Bang,who offered him a goblet of wine,drank a toast to him,and pledged to link their families by marriage. “Since I came through the Pass,I have not touched so much as a hair,"he declared."I have made a register of officials and citizens and sealed up the treasuries until the commander’s arrival.I have sent offic- ers to guard the Pass to prevent bandits going through it and to be ready for any emergency.Night and day I have been awaiting the commander.How dare I rebel against him?Please make it clear to him that I could not be so ungrateful.” Xiang Bo agreed to do so,adding,"You must come early tomor- row morning to apologize in person to Lord Xiang Yu.” This Liu Bang promised to do. Then Xiang Bo went back by night to Xiang Yu's camp and told him all Liu Bang had said. "If the lord of Pei had not conquered Qin,you would not have been able to enter,"he pointed out."It is wrong to attack a man who has done you so great a service.You had better treat him handsomely." Xiang Yu agreed.

沛公旦日从百余骑来见项王，至鸿门，谢曰：“臣与将军戮力而攻秦，将军战河北，臣战河南，然不自意能先入关破秦,得复见将军于此。今者有小人之言，令将军与臣有隙。”项王曰：“此沛公左司马曹无伤言之，不然，籍何以至此。”项王即日因留沛公与饮。项王、项伯东向坐,亚父南向坐。亚父者，范增也。沛公北向坐，张良西向侍。范增数目项王，举所佩玉玦以示之者三,项王默然不应。范增起，出召项庄,谓曰：“君王为人不忍,若入前为寿。寿毕，请以剑舞，因击沛公于坐，杀之。不者，若属皆且为所虏。”庄则入为寿，寿毕，曰：“君王与沛公饮，军中无以为乐，请以剑舞。”项王曰：“诺。”项庄拔剑起舞，项伯亦拔剑起舞，常以身翼蔽沛公，庄不得击。于是张良至军门，见樊哙。樊哙曰：“今日之事何如?”良曰：“甚急。今者项庄拔剑舞，其意常在沛公也。”哙曰：“此迫矣，臣请入，与之同命。”哙即带剑拥盾入军门。交戟之卫士欲止不内,樊哙侧其盾以撞，卫士仆地，哙遂入。披帷西向立,瞋目视项王,头发上指，目眦尽裂。项王按剑而跽曰：“客何为者?”张良曰：“沛公之参乘樊哙者也。”项王曰：“壮士!赐之卮酒。”则与斗卮酒。哙拜谢，起，立而饮之。项王曰：“赐之彘肩。”则与一生彘肩。樊哙覆其盾于地，加彘肩上，拔剑切而啖之。项王曰：“壮士，能复饮乎?”樊哙曰：“臣死且不避，卮酒安足辞!夫秦王有虎狼之心，杀人如不能举，刑人如恐不胜,天下皆叛之。怀王与诸将约曰：‘先破秦人咸阳者王之。’今沛公先破秦入咸阳，豪毛不敢有所近，封闭宫室，还军霸上，以待大王来。故遣将守关者，备他盗出入与非常也。劳苦而功高如此，未有封侯之赏，而听细说,欲诛有功之人。此亡秦之续耳，窃为大王不取也。”项王未有以应,曰：“坐。”樊哙从良坐。坐须臾，沛公起如厕，因招樊哙出。
第二天一早，刘邦只带了百十来个人，骑马来到了鸿门，他一见项羽就低声下气地分辩说：“这几年来我和将军您齐心协力地攻打秦朝，您攻取河北，我攻取河南，至于我能先入关灭了秦朝，今天又能早一步地在这里迎接您，这都是我没想到的。可是今天居然有小人挑拨您和我的关系，让您怀疑我。”项羽说：“这都是您的左司马曹无伤说的，不然我怎么能怀疑您呢?”于是项羽就把刘邦留下来，为他举行酒会。项羽和项伯朝东坐，亚父朝南坐。亚父就是范增。刘邦朝北坐，张良朝西陪坐。酒会开始后，范增连连地给项羽使眼色，又几次地拨弄他身上所佩的玉玦向项羽示意，让他下决心动手，但项羽默默地不加理睬。范增无法，只好站起来出去找项庄。他对项庄说：“大王为人心肠太软，你现在进去给他们敬酒，敬完酒就请求给他们舞剑助兴。而后你就趁机把刘邦杀死在他的座位上，要不然你们这些人日后都得成了他的俘虏。”项庄听罢立刻进帐向刘邦、项羽敬酒，敬完酒后说：“大王和沛公在这里饮酒，军营中也没什么东西可以供娱乐，那就请让我舞一趟剑来给你们助兴吧。”项羽说：“好的。”于是项庄就拔出宝剑开始舞了起来。项伯一看就明白了项庄的意思，于是他也起来拔剑起舞，而且有意地用自己的身体掩护着刘邦，使得项庄没有办法下手。张良一看，赶紧出帐到军门去找樊哙。樊哙一见张良，赶紧迎上前问：“里边的事情怎么样了?”张良说：“危险极了。现在项庄正在舞剑，他的意思完全是对着我们沛公的。”樊哙说：“这就很紧急了。我要进去.和项羽拼命!”说罢樊哙就左手按着剑柄，右手以盾牌护身往军门里闯。守门的卫士们架起双戟，拦住他不让他进去。樊哙侧过盾牌朝卫士们一撞，卫士们被撞倒在地，于是樊哙进了军门，来到帐前。他掀开了门帘，怒气冲冲地对着项羽一站，圆圆的眼圈瞪得都快要裂开了。项羽一看立刻手按剑柄，跪了起来，问道：“你是什么人?”张良赶紧从旁边介绍说：“这是沛公的随车警卫樊哙。”项羽一听，立刻松了一口气，并顺口称赞说：“好汉子!给他来杯酒!”旁边赶紧递给了他一大斗酒，樊哙俯身叩谢后，站起来一饮而尽。项羽又说：“给他来只猪腿。”旁边的人故意给了他一只生猪腿。樊哙把盾牌扣在地上，接过猪腿放在上面，拔出剑来一边切着一边吃。项羽一见不由得又赞美说：“好汉子!还能再喝吗?”樊哙说：“我连死都不怕，难道还推辞一杯酒吗?想当初秦王像虎狼一样，杀人唯恐不尽，用刑唯恐不狠，结果弄得天下都造了他的反。一年前怀王当众和各路诸侯们约定‘谁最先破秦入咸阳，谁就当关中王'。现在沛公先破秦进了咸阳，进城后，一草一木都没敢动，封好了宫室，驻军到霸上，等着大王的到来。我们之所以派人守住函谷关，那是为了防备盗贼出入和其他的变故。像沛公这样的劳苦功高之人，不仅没得到您应有的封赏，您反而听信小人的坏话，要杀害有功之臣。您所走的，完全是那个已被灭亡的暴秦的老路。我认为您是万万不该这样的。”项羽听罢无言以对，只是说：“请坐。”于是樊哙就挨着张良一齐坐了下来。过了一会儿，刘邦站起来去厕所，也一道把樊哙叫了出去。
The next day Liu Bang,followed by some hundred horsemen, came to Xiang Yu's camp at Hongmen and made his apologies. "I,your humble servant,joined with you to attack Qin,"he said. "You fought north of the Yellow River while I fought south.I had not expected to be the first to enter the Pass and conquer Qin,so that we meet again here.Now some evil-minded man has been sowing doubt in your mind.” "It was your own officer Cao Wushang,"replied Xiang Yu.“Oth- erwise such a thing would never have occurred to me." Xiang Yu invited Liu Bang to stay for a banquet.He and Xiang Bo sat facing east,the patriarch Fan Zeng faced south;Liu Bang faced north and Zhang Liang,who was in attendance upon him,faced west. Several times Fan Zeng shot Xiang Yu meaningful glances and three times,as a hint,raised his jade jue.⁵But Xiang Yu did not respond. Finally Fan Zeng rose and went out.Summoning Xiang Zhuang,he said: “Our lord is too kind-hearted.Go in,drink a toast and offer to perform a sword dance.Then strike the lord of Pei down where he sits.If you don't do this,we will all end up his captives.” Xiang Zhuang went in to offer a toast,after which he said,“Our prince is drinking with the lord of Pei,but we have no entertainers in the army.May I perform a sword dance?”"Very well,"said Xiang Yu. Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and began the dance,and Xiang Bo followed suit,shielding Liu Bang with his body so that Xiang Zhuang could not strike him. Zhang Liang went out to the gate of the camp to see Fan Kuai, who asked,“How are things in there?” "Touch and go,"replied Zhang Liang.“Xiang Zhuang has drawn his sword to dance.He means to kill the lord of Pei.” “This is serious!"said Fan Kuai."Let me go in and have it out with him." Sword and shield in hand he entered the gate.Guards with crossed halberds tried to bar the way,but he charged and knocked them down with his tilted shield.Bursting into the tent,he lifted the curtain and stood facing west,glaring at Xiang Yu.His hair bristled,his eyes nearly started from his head.Xiang Yu raised himself on one knee and reached for his sword. "Who is this stranger?"he asked. "This is the lord of Pei's bodyguard,Fan Kuai,"answered Zhang Liang. "Stout fellow!"said Xiang Yu.“Give him a stoup of wine.” Wine was poured and presented to Fan Kuai,who bowed his thanks and straightened up to drink it standing. "Give him a leg of pork,"directed Xiang Yu. A raw leg of pork was given to Fan Kuai,who set his shield up- side down on the ground,placed the pork on it,carved it with his sword and began to eat. "Stout fellow!"cried Xiang Yu.“Can you drink any more?” "I am not afraid of death;why should I refuse a drink?"retorted Fan Kuai.“The king of Qin had the heart of a tiger or a wolf.He killed more men than one could count and tortured others cruelly.So the whole world revolted against him.King Huai promised his generals that the first to conquer the land of Qin and enter its capital should be its king.Now the lord of Pei has conquered Qin and taken Xianyang. But he has not touched anything.He sealed up the palaces,withdrew his troops to Bashang to wait for you,and sent men to guard the Pass against bandits and other emergencies.Yet though he has laboured so hard and achieved so much,you do not reward him with noble rank but listen to worthless talk and decide to kill this hero.This is to go on in the way that led to the downfall of Qin.Please do not act like this, Your Majesty.” Xiang Yu could not answer. "Sit down,"he said. Fan Kuai took a seat next to Zhang Liang.Presently Liu Bang got up and went out to the privy,beckoning Fan Kuai to go with him.

沛公已出，项王使都尉陈平召沛公。沛公曰：“今者出，未辞也，为之奈何?”樊哙曰：“大行不顾细谨大礼不辞小让。如今人方为刀俎,我为鱼肉，何辞为?”于是遂去。乃令张良留谢。良问曰：“大王来何操?”曰：“我持白璧一双，欲献项王；玉斗一双,欲与亚父。会其怒，不敢献。公为我献之。”张良曰：“谨诺。”当是时，项王军在鸿门下，沛公军在霸上，相去四十里。沛公则置车骑,脱身独骑，与樊哙、夏侯婴、靳彊、纪信等四人持剑盾步走,从郦山下,道芷阳间行。沛公谓张良曰：“从此道至吾军，不过二十里耳。度我至军中，公乃入。”沛公已去，间至军中四，张良入谢，曰：“沛公不胜杯杓,不能辞。谨使臣良奉白璧一双，再拜献大王足下；玉斗一双，再拜奉大将军足下。”项王曰：“沛公安在?”良曰：“闻大王有意督过之，脱身独去，已至军矣。”项王则受璧，置之坐上。亚父受玉斗，置之地，拔剑撞而破之，曰：“唉!竖子不足与谋。夺项王天下者，必沛公也，吾属今为之虏矣。”沛公至军,立诛杀曹无伤。
刘邦出去后久久不回，于是项羽就让他的都尉陈平出去找。刘邦说：“刚才我们出来，并没有向项羽告辞，这样合适吗?”樊哙说：“要干大事就不要管那些细节的挑剔，要行大礼就不要怕那些琐碎的指责。如今人家是菜刀、砧板，我们是受人家宰割的鱼肉，还讲究什么告辞!”于是刘邦决定逃走。他把张良留下来，处理善后事宜。张良问道：“您来的时候带了什么礼物?”刘邦说：“我带了一对白璧，是给项羽的；一对玉斗，是给范增的。刚才正赶上他们发脾气，还没来得及给他们，您替我给他们吧。”张良说：“好的。”当时，项羽的大营是在鸿门，刘邦的大营在霸上，中间相隔四十里。于是刘邦就把来时的车马从人都扔下，独自骑着一匹马，让樊哙、夏侯婴、靳彊、纪信四人手持剑盾，步行跟着，从骊山下经芷阳抄小路逃走了。刘邦临走时对张良说：“我从这条小道回军营，不过二十里路，你估计着等我已经到了驻地的时候，再进帐去对项羽说。”刘邦走后，约摸着已经到了霸上军营，于是张良进帐对项羽说：“刚才沛公已经喝得不能再喝，以至于都不能亲自来向您告辞了。他来时带的礼物有白璧一对，让我转交给您；有玉斗一对，让我转交给大将军范增。”项羽问：“沛公现在哪里?”张良说：“他听说您想要惩罚他，所以他吓得回去了。估计现在已经回到了军营。”项羽没有作声，接过了玉璧，放在了座位上。范增接过玉斗，气愤地往地上一摔，拔出剑来把它砍得粉碎。说：“唉!干不成事的小子，简直没法与他合作!将来夺走项王天下的，一定是刘邦!我们这些人很快就要成为他的俘虏啦!”刘邦一回到军营，立刻把左司马曹无伤处决了。
Xiang Yu ordered his lieutenant Chen Ping to call him back. "I've come out without taking leave,"said Liu Bang."What shallI do?” "Where big issues are at stake you cannot trouble about trifles," said Fan Kuai."In matters of consequence you cannot observe the minor courtesies.They are the chopper and board,we the fish and meat.Why should we take our leave?” So Liu Bang started off,telling Zhang Liang to stay behind to make his excuses. "What gifts did you bring with you,my lord?"asked Zhang Liang. “A pair of white jade discs for Lord Xiang Yu,and a pair of jade wine cups for the patriarch Fan Zeng.Seeing how angry they were,I dared not present them.Will you please do so for me?” "Very good,my lord,"said Zhang Liang. Now Xiang Yu's camp was at Hongmen and Liu Bang's at Bashang some forty li away.Leaving his chariot and retinue,Liu Bang rode off alone,followed on foot by Fan Kuai,Xiahou Ying,Jin Qiang and Ji Xin,who carried swords and shields.Skirting Mount Li,they took a short cut to Zhiyang. "By this route it is only twenty li to my camp,"Liu Bang had told ZhangLiang."Wait until you think I have got there before you go back in.” When enough time had passed for him to reach his troops,Zhang Liang went in to apologize for him. "The lord of Pei had too much to drink and was unable to take his leave,"he said."He asked your humble servant to present this pair of white jade discs to Your Lordship and this pair of jade wine cups to the Patriarch.” "Where is he now?"asked Xiang Yu. “Knowing that your Lordship meant to censure him,he left alone. He must be in his camp by now.” Xiang Yu accepted the discs and placed them on his mat.But Fan Zeng put the jade cups on the ground,drew his sword and smashed them to pieces. "Bah!"he cried."Advice is wasted on a fool.The lord of Pei will wrest your empire from you and take us all captive.” As soon as Liu Bang reached his camp,he had Cao Wushang executed.

居数日，项羽引兵西屠咸阳，杀秦降王子婴,烧秦宫室，火三月不灭;收其货宝妇女而东。人或说项王曰:“关中阻山河四塞,地肥饶，可都以霸。”项王见秦宫皆以烧残破，又心怀思欲东归，曰：“富贵不归故乡，如衣绣夜行，谁知之者!”说者曰：“人言楚人沐猴而冠耳,果然。”项王闻之，烹说者。
又过了些天，项羽带兵进入咸阳，大肆烧杀掳掠。他杀了已经投降的秦三世子婴，烧毁了秦朝的所有宫殿.以至于使熊熊大火一直烧了三个月。而后他席卷了秦朝的一切财宝和妇女，准备向东撤去。当时有人曾劝他说：“关中地区四面有高山大河为屏障，这里的土地肥沃富饶，如果建都在这里真可以称霸于天下。”可是项羽看着秦朝的宫殿都已烧成了一片瓦砾，加上他的乡土观念又很强，总想把国都建到他的家乡附近，于是说：“富贵了如果不回故乡，那就好比穿着锦绣的衣裳在夜间走路，谁能看得见呀!”那个劝项羽的人下去后不自禁地感叹说：“人家都说楚国人目光短浅，就像是一只猕猴，即使它带上了帽子，也始终成不了人，看来真是如此!”项羽听到了传言，立刻派人把他抓起来，用汤锅烹死了。
A few days later Xiang Yu led his troops west,massacred the citi- zens of Xianyang,killed Ziying,the last king of Qin who had surrendered,and set fire to the Qin palaces.The conflagration raged for three whole months.Havinglooted the city and seized the women there,he started east. Someone advised him,"The region inside the Pass is surrounded by mountains and rivers which form natural barriers,and the soil is fertile.You could make this your capital and rule supreme.” But now the Qin palaces were destroyed by fire and Xiang Yu longed to go back to his home in the east. "What use are wealth and rank if you do not gohome?"he retorted. “That is like wearing embroidered clothes at night when nobody can see you." "They say the men of Chu are apes with hats on,"observed a wit later."It's really true."When Xiang Yu heard this,he had the man thrown into a boiling cauldron.

项王使人致命怀王。怀王曰：“如约。”乃尊怀王为义帝。项王欲自王，先王诸将相。谓曰：“天下初发难时，假立诸侯后以伐秦。然身被坚执锐首事，暴露于野三年，灭秦定天下者，皆将相诸君与籍之力也。义帝虽无功，故当分其地而王之。”诸将皆曰：“善。”乃分天下，立诸将为侯王。
项羽派人去向楚怀王请示分封各路诸侯为王的事情。楚怀王强硬地坚持说：“按原来的约定办!”项羽把楚怀王尊为义帝。项羽打算自己称王，先给各路将领们封王加号。他说：“当初大家发难起事的时候，都曾立了一些六国诸侯的后代作幌子。但真正冲锋陷阵，风餐露宿，野战三年，推翻了秦朝的，是你们诸位和我。义帝虽然没有什么具体功劳，我们还应当分给他一块土地让他称王。”大家都说：“对!”于是项羽就分割天下，封立各路将领们为王侯。
Xiang Yu sent a messenger to report to King Huai. "Let it be as we agreed,"replied the king. Then King Huai received the title of Righteous Emperor.Xiang Yu,who wished to be a king,first made the other generals and minis- ters kings. “When the revolt broke out,we set up the descendants of differ- ent royal houses as a temporary measure to attack Qin,"he said."We are the ones,however,who took up arms,started the revolt and risked our lives on the battlefield for three years until Qin was overthrown and the empire pacified.The Righteous Emperor has done nothing. Let us divide up his land and make ourselves kings.” The generals agreed to this and they divided the empire,making themselves lords and kings.

项王、范增疑沛公之有天下，业已讲解,又恶负约，恐诸侯叛之。乃阴谋曰：“巴、蜀道险四，秦之迁人皆居蜀。”乃曰：“巴、蜀亦关中地也"。”故立沛公为汉王，王巴、蜀、汉中,都南郑。而三分关中，王秦降将以距塞汉王。
项羽和范增本来是担心刘邦的，怕将来整个天下落入他手。但由于他们在鸿门已经讲和了，现在也不好反悔，怕由此引起其他诸侯们的反叛，便和范增等人私下策划说：“巴、蜀地区山路险远，是过去秦朝流放罪人的地方。”就对大家说：“现在的巴、蜀.也是关中管辖的一部分。”于是就封立刘邦为汉王，统管巴、蜀、汉中三个地区，首都设在南郑。而把真正的关中平原分为三块，分给秦朝的三个降将，让他们在关中堵住刘邦的出路。
Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng suspected that Liu Bang meant to seize the whole realm.But having settled their dispute with him,they hesitated to break their word for fear the other leaders might not support them.So they plotted together saying,"The lands of Ba and Shu are mountain- ous and impassable.That is where all the exiles used to be sent by Qin." Then,announcing that Ba and Shu were also inside the Pass,they made Liu Bang king of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.)to rule over Ba,Shu and Hanzhong,with his capital at Nanzheng.And Qin was divided into three kingdoms under the Qin generals who had surrendered,as buffer states against Han.

项王乃立章邯为雍王，王咸阳以西，都废丘。长史欣者，故为栎阳狱掾，尝有德于项梁；都尉董翳者，本劝章邯降楚。故立司马欣为塞王，王咸阳以东至河，都栎阳;立董翳为翟王，王上郡，都高奴。徙魏王豹为西魏王，王河东，都平阳。瑕丘申阳者，张耳嬖臣也,先下河南”,迎楚河上,故立申阳为河南王，都雒阳。韩王成因故都，都阳翟"。赵将司马卬定河内,数有功，故立卬为殷王，王河内，都朝歌。徙赵王歇为代王。赵相张耳素贤，又从入关，故立耳为常山王，王赵地，都襄国。当阳君黥布为楚将，常冠军，故立布为九江王，都六。鄱君吴芮率百越佐诸侯，又从入关，故立芮为衡山王，都邾。义帝柱国共敖将兵击南郡,功多，因立敖为临江王.都江陵。徙燕王韩广为辽东王。燕将臧荼从楚救赵，因从入关，故立荼为燕王，都蓟。徙齐王田市为胶东王。齐将田都从共救赵，因从入关，故立都为齐王，都临蓄。故秦所灭齐王建孙田安,项羽方渡河救赵，田安下济北数城,引其兵降项羽，故立安为济北王，都博阳。田荣者，数负项梁,又不肯将兵从楚击秦，以故不封。成安君陈馀弃将印去，不从入关，然素闻其贤，有功于赵，闻其在南皮，故因环封三县。番君将梅锅功多，故封十万户侯。项王自立为西楚霸王,王九郡够，都彭城。
项羽于是封章邯为雍王，统辖咸阳以西，首都设在废丘。长史司马欣，过去在做栎阳县的典狱长时，曾对项梁有过恩德；都尉董翳则是劝章邯投降项羽的关键人物，所以项羽封司马欣为塞王，统辖咸阳以东，直至黄河边上，首都设在栎阳；封董翳为翟王，统辖上郡一带，首都设在高奴。接着又把原来以大梁为领地的魏王豹改封为西魏王，让他统辖河东地区，首都设在平阳。原来的瑕丘县令申阳，是张耳的宠臣，曾经先打下了河南郡，在黄河边上迎接项羽，因此项羽封申阳为河南王，首都设在洛阳。韩王成的封号依旧不变，仍在过去的地方，首都还是阳翟。赵国的将领司马印平定河内有功，因此封司马印为殷王，统辖河内地区，首都设在朝歌。把原来的赵王歇改封为代王。而赵国的宰相张耳素有贤名，又是跟着项羽一道入关的，所以封张耳为常山王，统辖赵地，首都设在襄国。当阳君黥布是项羽手下的名将，常常勇冠全军，因此封黥布为九江王，首都设在六县。原来的都县县令吴芮，曾率领南方的百越配合诸侯们一起反秦，又跟着诸侯们一道入了关，因此封吴芮为衡山王，首都设在邾县。义帝的上柱国共敖，曾领兵打下了南郡，功劳不小，因此封共敖为临江王，首都设在江陵。把原来的燕王韩广改封为辽东王。而燕国的将领臧荼曾配合楚军救赵，又跟着项羽一同进关，因此封臧荼为燕王，首都设在蓟县。把原来的齐王田市改封为胶东王。而齐国的将领田都曾配合楚军一同救赵，又跟着项羽进关，因此封田都为齐王，首都设在临淄。过去被秦所灭的齐王田建的孙子田安，在项羽率兵过黄河救赵的时候，曾经攻克了济水以北好几个城池，带兵投降了项羽，因此封田安为济北王，首都设在博阳。而田荣这个人曾多次背叛项梁，后来又不肯带兵跟着项羽一道攻秦，所以这次没有封他。成安君陈馀，在楚军救赵后，他摔下自己的将印走了，后来又不跟诸侯们一道进关，照理也该不封，但由于他平素名声不错，而且对于保卫赵国有功劳.听说他眼下正在南皮，于是就把南皮周围的三个县划给了他。原来鄱县县令的将领梅铜功劳很大，因此封他为十万户侯。而项羽本人，则自封为西楚霸王，统辖九个郡的地区,首都设在彭城。
Xiang Yu made Zhang Han king of Yong to rule over the territory west of Xianyang with his capital at Feiqiu.His secreytary Sima Xin,the former gaoler of Yueyang who had helped Xiang Liang,was also made a king.So was the army commander Dong Yi,who had advised Zhang Han to surrender to Xiang Yu. Sima Xin became king of Sai,ruling over the territory east of Xianyang as far as the Yellow River,with his capital at Yueyang.Dong Yi was made king of Di to rule Shangjun Province with his capital at Gaonu.King Bao of Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.)was sent west to be king of West Wei,ruling over Hedong with his capital at Pingyang.Shen Yang of Xiaqiu,Zhang Er's favourite who had conquered the prov- ince of Henan and surrendered to the Chu army by the river,was made king of Henan with his capital at Luoyang.King Cheng of Han (403B.C.-230B.C.)remained where he was,with Yangzhai as his capital. Sima Ang,a general of Zhao who had conquered Henei and won several victories,was made king of Yin over Henei with his capital at Chaoge.King Xie of Zhao was transferred to be king of Dai.Zhang Er,the able chief minister of Zhao who had accompanied the Chu army through the Pass,was made king of Changshan ruling over Zhao with his capital at Xiangguo.Ying Bu,lord of Dangyang,who had proved the bravest general of the Chu army,was made king of Jiujiang with his capital at Liu.Wu Rui,lord of Po,who had led the Bai Yue tribesmen as reinforcements to the feudal princes and followed Xiang Yu through the Pass,was made king of Hengshan with his capital at Zhu.Gong Ao,the Righ- teous Emperor's minister who had led troops against Nanjun and won many victories,was made king of Linjiang with his capital at Jiangling. Han Guang,king of Yan,was transferred to be king of Liaodong. The Yan general Zang Tu,who had joined the Chu forces to rescue Zhao and accompanied Xiang Yu through the Pass,was made king of Yan with his capital at Qi.Tian Fu,king of Qi,was transferred to be king of Jiaodong.The Qigeneral Tian Du,who had joined the Chu forces to rescue Zhao and accompanied Xiang Yu through the Pass, was made king of Qi with his capital at Linzi. Then there was Tian An,grandson of the former king of Qi,who was coquered byQin.When Xiang Yu crossed the river to rescue Zhao, Tian An took several cities north of the River Ji and came over to Xiang Yu with his forces.He was therefore made king of Jibei,with his capital at Boyang. Tian Rong,who had often disobeyed Xiang Liang's orders and refused to aid Chu against Qin,was given no title.Though Chen Yu, lord of Cheng'an,had abandoned his commander's seal and refused to follow Xiang Yu into the Pass,he was known to be a talented man who had served Zhao well.When it was learned that he was at Nanpi, he was given three adjacent counties.MeiJuan,a general under the lord of Powho had many bold deeds to his credit,received a fief of one hundred thousand households.As for Xiang Yu,he set himself up as Overlord of West Chu,with nine provinces as his kingdom and Pengcheng as his capital.

汉之元年四月,诸侯罢戏下,各就国。项王出之国,使人徙义帝,曰：“古之帝者地方千里，必居上游。”乃使使徙义帝长沙郴县,趣义帝行。其群臣稍稍背叛之。乃阴令衡山、临江王击杀之江中。韩王成无军功，项王不使之国，与俱至彭城，废以为侯，已又杀之”。臧荼之国，因逐韩广之辽东。广弗听，荼击杀广无终，并王其地。
汉王元年四月，各路诸侯都从项羽的麾下解散，回到自己的封地去了。项羽也准备离开关中到自己的封地去，他首先派人催着义帝搬家。他说：“古时候的帝王不仅拥有千里封地，而且还必定要居住在江河的上游。”于是他就下令把义帝迁到长沙郡的郴县去，而且催着义帝快走。义帝的群臣一见这种情景，渐渐地开始背叛项羽，项羽暗中给衡山王吴芮和临江王共敖下密令，让他们在长江上把义帝杀掉了。韩王成因为没有军功，项羽不准他去自己的封地，把他带到了彭城，先是把他降爵为侯，随后又杀了他。燕王臧荼到了自己的封国后，驱逐原来的燕王韩广去辽东，韩广不去，臧荼就把韩广杀死在无终。并把韩广的辽东封地也收归己有。
In the fourth month of the first year of Han(206B.C.-8A.D.),the various kings withdrew their troops and returned to their own countries. When Xiang Yu reached his kingdom,he gave orders for the removal of the Righteous Emperor,saying,"In ancient times an emperor who had one thousand square liof territory always lived on the upper reaches of a river."His envoy told the emperor to move to the district of Chen in Changsha,and kept urging him to go till one by one the emperor's ministers left him.Then Xiang Yu secretly ordered the kings of Hengshan and Linjiang to attack and kill the emperor on the river. As King Cheng of Han (403B.C.-230B.C.)had won no victories, Xiang Yu prevented his return to his kingdom by taking him to Pengcheng.There,having degraded him to rank of a marquis,he killed him.When Zang Tu went to his state of Yan,he tried to drive away the former king,Han Guang,to Liaodong.As Han Guang refused to go, Zang Tu attacked and killed him at Wuzhong and annexed his territory.

田荣闻项羽徙齐王市胶东，而立齐将田都为齐王，乃大怒，不肯遣齐王之胶东，因以齐反，迎击田都。田都走楚。齐王市畏项王，乃亡之胶东就国。田荣怒，追击杀之即墨。荣因自立为齐王，而西击杀济北王田安，并王三齐。荣与彭越将军印，令反梁地。陈馀阴使张同、夏说说齐王田荣曰:“项羽为天下宰,不平。今尽王故王于丑地，而王其群臣诸将善地，逐其故主，赵王乃北居代,馀以为不可。闻大王起兵，且不听不义,愿大王资馀兵,请以击常山,以复赵王，请以国为捍蔽。”齐王许之，因遣兵之赵。陈馀悉发三县兵，与齐并力击常山，大破之。张耳走归汉。陈馀迎故赵王歇于代，反之赵。赵王因立陈馀为代王。
田荣听说项羽把齐王田市迁到胶东，而封齐将田都为齐王，非常愤怒。他让齐王田市不要去胶东，同时以齐国的地盘为根据地，迎击受项羽之封前来齐国上任的田都。田都逃到了楚国。而齐王田市因为害怕项羽，便偷偷逃出临淄.前去胶东的封国上任了。田荣恼怒之极.派人追到即墨，杀死了田市。于是田荣随即自立为齐王，接着又向西出兵破杀了济北王田安，从而使旧日齐国地面上的三个国家都归入了他的统辖之下。接着田荣又给了彭越一颗将军印，封他为将军，让他在梁地造项羽的反。而陈馀暗自派张同、夏说来见齐王田荣说：“项羽分封天下分封得不公平。他把原来的诸侯王全封在了坏的地方，而把自己的群臣众将都封在了好地方。他把我们原来的赵王歇赶到了北边的代地，我觉得这么干是不行的。如今听说您已经起兵造他的反了，而且决不允许不仗义的事情存在，现在我请求您支援我们一部分兵力，让我去攻打常山王张耳，以帮助赵王收复旧有的赵国，这样，我们就可以用赵国来给您作为屏障。”田荣答应了，随即派兵前往赵国。陈馀又调动了自己所属的三个县的所有壮丁，与齐军合并，一起攻打常山，结果张耳被打败，只好去逃归了刘邦。于是陈馀把赵王歇从代地迎回了赵国，赵王歇随即封陈馀做了代王。
When Tian Rong heard that Xiang Yu had removed the king of Qi to Jiaodong,setting up the Qigeneral Tian Du in his stead,he was very angry and refused to let Tian Du take up his new position in Qi but rose in arms and attacked him.Tian Du fled to the land of Chu.Since King Wang Shi was afraid of Xiang Yu,he fled to Jiaodong,his new realm.Tian Rong pursed him in anger and killed him at Jimo.Then Tian Rong made himself king of Qi and marched west to attack and kill Tian An,king of Jibei.He now ruled over Qi,Jiaodong and Jibei. Tian Rong gave Peng Yue a commander's seal and ordered him to revolt in the land of Wei.Chen Yu also sent Zhang Tong and Xia Yue in secret to advise him. "Xiang Yu has not divided the country fairly,"they said.“He has made all the former kings rulers of poor lands,but made his generals and ministers kings of rich districts.He drove the former king of Zhao north to the land of Dai.We do not think this is right.Now we hear Your Highness has taken up arms,unable to endure this injustice. We hope you will lend us troops to attack Changshan and restore the king of Zhao.We will gladly serve as your bulwark.” Tian Rong agreed and sent troops to the land of Zhao.Chen Yu mobilized the men of his three counties and together they attacked Changshan and routed Zhang Er,who fled to Han(206B.C.-8A.D.). Then Chen Yu welcomed back the former king of Zhao from Dai, and the king made Chen Yu king of Dai.

是时，汉还定三秦。项羽闻汉王皆已并关中，且东,齐、赵叛之,大怒。乃以故吴令郑昌为韩王,以距汉。令萧公角等击彭越。彭越败萧公角等。汉使张良徇韩,乃遗项王书曰：“汉王失职,欲得关中，如约即止，不敢东。”又以齐、赵反书遗项王曰：“齐欲与赵并灭楚。”楚以此故无西意，而北击齐。征兵九江王布。布称疾不往，使将将数千人行。项王由此怨布也。汉之二年冬四，项羽遂北至城阳,田荣亦将兵会战。田荣不胜，走至平原，平原民杀之。遂北烧夷齐城郭室屋，皆坑田荣降卒，系虏其老弱妇女。徇齐至北海,多所残灭。齐人相聚而叛之。于是田荣弟田横收齐亡卒得数万人，反城阳。项王因留，连战未能下。
这时候，刘邦已从汉中杀了出来，平定了三秦。项羽听说刘邦已经全部占有了关中，而且马上又要出兵东进，而齐、赵两国又同时造了自已的反，不禁大怒。他立刻封原来的吴县县令郑昌为韩王，让他西去阻挡刘邦，让萧公角等去讨伐彭越，结果萧公角等被彭越击败了。这时刘邦派张良东出招抚韩国，张良写了一封信给项羽说：“因为汉王没有得到他应该得到的关中，所以才出兵杀了回来。他只求能实现当初怀王的约定就满足了，决不敢再出兵东进和您争锋。”接着他又把齐国、赵国檄告天下的反书也附给了项羽，说：“真正想要联合起来消灭您的，是齐国和赵国。”这样一来就完全打消了项羽对西方刘邦的注意，而集中力量北上去进攻齐国了。项羽向九江王黥布征调兵力，黥布本人推托有病，不肯前去，而只派了一员将领带着几千士兵跟着项羽一道去。项羽从此也开始怨恨黥布。汉王二年的冬天，项羽率兵北进到了城阳.田荣也正好率兵到此。双方展开战斗，结果田荣大败。田荣逃到平原县，被平原人杀掉了。而项羽的军队则乘胜北进，一路上铲平城墙，烧毁房屋，对于一切降兵降将统统活埋，而把百姓家的一切妇女老弱，统统捉回营去做奴婢。就这样横贯齐国，一直到北海边，走到哪里，那里便化为一片废墟。齐国人不得不在各地聚集起来造反图存。这时田荣的弟弟田横又挺身而出，他收拾了齐国流散在各地的士兵几万人，重新在城阳举起了齐国大旗。项羽被牵制在齐国，一连几次进攻城阳，但都没能攻下。
At this time,the Han army turned back and conquered the three kingdoms of Yong,Sai and Di.When Xiang Yu heard that the king of Han had gained control of all the land within the Pass and was about to march east,and that Qi and Zhao had rebelled,he was very angry. He made Zheng Chang,former governor of Wu,king of Han(403B. C.-230B.C.)to repel the king of Han's advance,and ordered Jiao the lord of Xiao and others to attack Peng Yue.But Peng Yue defeated them. The king of Han(206B.C.-8A.D.)dispatched Zhang Liang to con- quer Han (403B.C.-230B.C.),and he wrote to Xiang Yu saying,"The king of Han has not received the territory promised him within the Pass.As soon as the agreement is carried out,he will halt and not advance any further east."He also sent Xiang Yu letters showing that Tian Rong and Peng Yue meant to revolt,that Qi would ally with Zhao to overthrow Chu.Then instead of advancing west,Xiang Yu proceeded north to attack Qi.He ordered Ying Bu,the king of Jiujiang,to bring up reinforcements;but Ying Bu did not join him on the pretext of illness, merely sending a general with several thousand men.Xiang Yu hated him for this. In the winter of the second year of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.),Xiang Yu went north to Chengyang,where Tian Rong joined battle with him. Tian Rong was defeated and fled to Pingyuan,to be killed by the people there.Xiang Yu advanced further north,and burned or razed to the ground all the suburbs of Qi,massacred Tian Rong's men who had surrendered,and took captive the old and infirm as well as the women. He conquered the land up to Beihai,spreading havoc and destruction. Then the men of Qigathered together and rebeled.Tian Rong's younger brother,Tian Heng,rallied what was left of the army,numbering tens of thousands of men,and raised a revolt at Chengyang.Xiang Yu was forced to stop and launch several assaults against the city,but he failed to take it.

春，汉王部五诸侯兵,凡五十六万人，东伐楚。项王闻之，即令诸将击齐，而自以精兵三万人南从鲁出胡陵。四月，汉皆已入彭城，收其货宝美人，日置酒高会。项王乃西从萧，晨击汉军而东,至彭城，日中，大破汉军。汉军皆走，相随入榖、泗水,杀汉卒十余万人。汉卒皆南走山。楚又追击至灵璧东睢水上。汉军却，为楚所挤，多杀，汉卒十余万人皆入睢水，睢水为之不流。围汉王三匝。于是大风从西北而起,折木发屋，扬沙石，窈冥昼晦,逢迎楚军，楚军大乱，坏散。而汉王乃得与数十骑遁去。欲过沛，收家室而西;楚亦使人追之沛，取汉王家。家皆亡,不与汉王相见。汉王道逢得孝惠、鲁元,乃载行。楚骑追汉王，汉王急，推堕孝惠、鲁元车下，滕公常下收载之，如是者三。曰：“虽急不可以驱，奈何弃之?”于是遂得脱。求太公、吕后，不相遇。审食其从太公、吕后间行求汉王,反遇楚军。楚军遂与归，报项王，项王常置军中。
到了这年春天，刘邦统率所有反对项羽的各路军队，共五十六万人，东进伐楚。项羽听到消息后，他留下了别的将领继续在齐国作战，而自己则率领着精兵三万人，经由曲阜、胡陵，而星夜返回楚国。四月，刘邦已经攻入了彭城，他占有了项羽所有的那些珍宝美女，每天大摆酒宴，吃喝玩乐。这时项羽已经到达彭城西面的萧县。第二天一早，项羽向东方发起攻击，直逼彭城，到中午时，项羽在彭城大破刘邦。刘邦的军队到处乱跑，许多人被赶入了穀水、泗水，仅在这里被杀的汉兵就有十多万人。其他的一些败军都向南逃进了山里，楚军又乘胜追杀到了灵璧东面的睢水边。汉军再次溃退，但是前有大河，后有追兵，汉军已被挤得无路可走了。于是十多万人纷纷跳进了睢水，以至于睢水都被堵塞得流不动了。楚军里外三层紧紧包围了刘邦。正在这关键时刻，忽然从西北方向刮起了一阵大风，拔起了树木，掀走了屋顶，飞沙走石，天色黑得伸手不见五指。这阵大风迎面向楚军吹去，楚军一下子乱了阵脚，溃不成形。于是刘邦才乘这个机会带着几十个随从一溜烟地骑马逃走了。当刘邦经过沛县的时候，他想把他的家眷也带上一起向西逃，而这时项羽也正好派兵到沛县去捉拿刘邦的家属。刘邦的家属早已经不知跑到什么地方去了，没能与刘邦见着面。后来刘邦在路上遇见了他的儿子和女儿，也就是日后的孝惠帝和鲁元公主，刘邦让他们上了自己的车。不一会儿，楚国的骑兵追上来了，刘邦心急，竟把他儿子和女儿推了下去。滕公夏侯婴赶紧下去把他们抱了上来。就这样刘邦一连把他们推下去好几次，滕公不忍地说：“就算是情况紧急，车子跑不快.但又怎么能忍心把孩子扔了呢?"后来大家终于都脱了险。刘邦一路上也在寻找太公和吕后，但始终没有找到。原来审食其跟着太公和吕后抄小道，也在寻找刘邦，却不料遇上了项羽的军队。项羽的军队于是带着他们回去，禀报项羽，项羽就把他们当作人质拘留在楚军的营中。
The following spring,the king of Han advanced east at the head of the allied troops of five states,five hundred and sixty thousand strong,to attack Chu.When Xiang Yu received word of this,he sent his generals to subdue Qiin the north,while he himself led thirty thou- sand picked troops south through Lu to Huling. In the fourth month,the Han soldiers entered Pengcheng,sacked the city,seized the women,and gave all their time to carousing.Xiang Yu struck at dawn from Xiao in the west and fell upon the Han army at Pengcheng in the east.By noon the Han forces were completely routed.They fled in disorder to the Gu and Si Rivers,where more than one hundred thousand of them were drowned.The rest retreated south to the hills,but the army of Chu pursued them to the banks of the River Sui,east of Lingbi.The Han troops fell back,hard pressed by the men of Chu.Some hundred thousand soldiers of Han were cut down and their bodies,thrown into the Sui,blocked the flow of the river. The pursuers threw three cordons round the king of Han.But just then a great wind sprang up from the northwest.It blew down trees and houses and raised swirling clouds of sand so that all grew dark and day turned into night.This storm beat against the army of Chu and threw it into confusion.Their ranks broke,enabling the king of Han to es- cape with several dozen horsemen. The king of Han set out for Pei,meaning to take his family west with him.But as Xiang Yu also sent pursuers to Pei,the king's family fled and missed him:On the road he met his son,later Emperor Hui, and his daughter,later Queen Yuan of Lu,and made them ride in his carriage.When the Chu cavalry came hot on their heels,the king in desperation pushed his children out;but Xiahou Ying,lord of Teng, got down and helped them in again.This happened three times."No matter how hard pressed we are,we cannot drive any faster,"pro- tested Xiahou Ying.“How can you abandon them?” When they had made good their escape,the king of Han looked in vain for his father and his wife,later Empress Lü.They,excorted by Shen Yiji,were searching for him when they ran into some Chu troops instead.The men of Chu reported their capture to Xiang Yu,who kept them in his army.

是时吕后兄周吕侯为汉将兵居下邑,汉王间往从之。稍稍收其士卒，至荥阳,诸败军皆会。萧何亦发关中老弱未傅悉诣荥阳,复大振。楚起于彭城，常乘胜逐北,与汉战荥阳南京、索间。汉败楚，楚以故不能过荥阳而西。
当时，吕后的哥哥周吕侯吕泽正作为刘邦的将领统兵驻扎在下邑，于是刘邦悄悄地抄小路去投奔了他，并在那里渐渐地又集合起了一些被打散的军队。接着他们一起向西退到了荥阳，彭城被打败的其他人马也逐渐地都汇集到这里来，萧何又不失时机地把关中地区一切尚未成年的孩子或是超过服役年龄的老人都一齐调集起来送到了荥阳，于是刘邦军队的气势又重新振作起来。项羽的军队从彭城出发，乘胜向西追击汉军，一直追到荥阳南面的京县和索亭一带，结果被汉军打败。从此，楚军再也没有能够跨过荥阳向西前进一步。
At this time Empress Lü's brother,LüZe,was in command of the Han troops at Xiayi.There the king of Han went,rallying stragglers on the way.By the time he reached Xingyang all his defeated soldiers had reassembled.Xiao He also mobilized all the old and weak within the Pass who had not been conscripted,and sent them to Xingyang.Thus their army became a force to reckon with again. The Chu troops,advancing from Pengcheng,followed up their victory and fought the Han army south of Xingyang between Jing and Suoting.But the men of Han defeated them there,checking their ad- vance further west.

项王之救彭城，追汉王至荥阳，田横亦得收齐，立田荣子广为齐王。汉王之败彭城，诸侯皆复与楚而背汉。汉军荥阳，筑甬道属之河,以取敖仓粟。汉之三年,项王数侵夺汉甬道。汉王食乏，恐，请和，割荥阳以西为汉。
正当项羽回师援救彭城，并进而追击刘邦到荥阳的时候，田横又乘机收复了齐国，并立田荣的儿子田广做了齐王。当刘邦在彭城惨败后，诸侯们又都脱离刘邦，重新归附项羽。这时，刘邦的军队驻扎在荥阳，他们修筑了一条甬道，一直通到黄河南岸，从中运取敖仓的粮食。汉王三年，项羽一连几次出兵攻击汉军的甬道。汉军粮草供应不上，刘邦很害怕，于是向项羽提出讲和，条件是荥阳以东的地盘归项羽，荥阳以西的地盘归刘邦。
hile Xiang Yu was relieving Pengcheng and pursuing the king of Han to Xingyang,Tian Heng was able to reconqure Qiand set up Tian Rong's son,Tian Guang,as king there.After Han's defeat at Pengcheng, all the other kings went over to Xiang Yu.The king of Han camped at Xingyang and constructed a walled road to the Yellow River to convey grain from Aocang. In the thirdyear of Han,Xiang Yu repeatedly cut this supply route so that the Han army ran short of food.The king of Han in alarm sued for peace,claiming only the territory west of Xingyang.

项王欲听之。历阳侯范增曰:“汉易与耳,今释弗取，后必悔之。”项王乃与范增急围荥阳。汉王患之，乃用陈平计间项王。项王使者来，为太牢具举欲进之。见使者，详惊愕曰：“吾以为亚父使者，乃反项王使者。”更持去，以恶食食项王使者。使者归报项王，项王乃疑范增与汉有私，稍夺之权。范增大怒，曰：“天下事大定矣,君王自为之。愿赐骸骨归卒伍。”项王许之。行未至彭城，疽发背而死。
项羽正想同意.历阳侯范增说：“现在的汉军是最容易对付的.如果现在放了他们不打，日后肯定会后悔。”项羽听取了范增的意见，下令加紧对荥阳的攻击。刘邦很伤脑筋，就采用了陈平设计的离间项羽与范增关系的办法。项羽派使者来到汉营，汉营的接待人员准备了牛、羊、猪三牲最高规格的筵席来招待他们。当招待人员把饭菜端上筵席后，一看是项羽的使者，就装出一种惊异的样子说：“我们还以为是亚父的使者呢.原来是项王的使者!”于是便把这些食物端回去，而重新端出一些粗劣的饭菜来招待他们。项羽的使者回去后把情况报告了项羽，项羽怀疑范增与刘邦私通，就逐渐地削减了范增的权力。范增很生气，说：“天下的大事基本确定了，以后的事您自己干吧。请允许我回家当个普通老百姓。”项羽批准了。范增上路东归，还没走到彭城，背上的毒疮发作而死。
Xiang Yu would have agreed,but Fan Zeng marquis of Liyang said,“The Han army is easy to crush.If you let them go,you will be sorry later.”So Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng hammered at Xingyang.In this desperate situation the king of Han adopted a plan devised by Chen Ping to sow dissension between Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng.When an envoy from Xiang Yu arrived,the king made ready a feast; but as it was being served he pretended to show great surprise on seeing who the envoy was. "I thought you were Fan Zeng's envoy,"he explained.“I see you come from Xiang Yu.” He had the feast removed and more common fare brought in. When the envoy went back and reported this,Xiang Yu suspected Fan Zeng of being in league with Han,and little by little deprived him of his authority.Fan Zeng was very angry. The empire is nearly won,"he said."Your Highness can manage alone.Allow me to retire to the ranks." Xiang Yugave his consent.But before Fan Zeng reached Pengcheng he had an abscess on his back and died.

汉将纪信说汉王曰：“事已急矣，请为王诳楚,王可以间出。”于是汉王夜出女子荥阳东门被甲二千人,楚兵四面击之。纪信乘黄屋车,傅左纛，曰：“城中食尽，汉王降。”楚军皆呼万岁。汉王亦与数十骑从城西门出，走成皋。项王见纪信，问：“汉王安在?”曰：“汉王已出矣。”项王烧杀纪信。
刘邦的将领纪信对刘邦说：“现在荥阳的形势已经很危急，请让我假扮您出去蒙骗项羽，而您可以趁机逃出城去。”于是刘邦在一个夜晚打开荥阳东门，把胁迫来的两千名顶盔挂甲的妇女赶了出去，楚军立刻从四面围攻上来。纪信假扮刘邦坐着一辆黄篷车，在左侧马的头上插着一撮牦牛尾，喊道：“城里的粮食已经吃光，汉王出来投降了!”楚军立刻高呼万岁。而这时刘邦却带着几十个随从，开西城门出城，逃到了成皋。项羽捉到纪信后问他：“汉王在哪里?”纪信说：“汉王早已离开荥阳了。"项羽将纪信烧死。
Then Ji Xin,a general of Han,said to the king,"We are in desper- ate straits,sit.Let me impersonate you to deceive the Chu army so that you may escape." One night the king sent the women of Xingyang together with two thousand soldiers out through the east gate,and the Chu troops attacked them from all sides.Ji Xin,in the carriage with the yellow canopy and the feather pennanton the left,came out to declare,"There is no food left in the city.The king of Han surrenders.”While all the Chu soldiers were cheering,the king of Han slipped out through the west gate with a few dozen horsemen and fled to Chenggao.When Xiang Yu saw Ji Xin,he demanded:“Where is your king?” "His Majesty had already left,"was the answer. Xiang Yu had Ji Xin burned alive.

汉王使御史大夫周苛、枞公、魏豹守荥阳。周苛、枞公谋曰：“反国之王，难与守城。”乃共杀魏豹。楚下荥阳城，生得周苛。项王谓周苛曰：“为我将，我以公为上将军，封三万户。”周苛骂曰：“若不趣降汉，汉今虏若,若非汉敌也。”项王怒，烹周苛，并杀枞公。
刘邦离开荥阳前，留下了御史大夫周苛、枞公和魏豹在荥阳坚守。周苛与枞公立即商量说：“魏豹是一个曾经背叛过我们的家伙，我们不能和他一道共事。”于是俩人就把魏豹杀了。楚军攻下荥阳，活捉了周苛。项羽对周苛说：“你今后跟着我，我可以让你当上将军，封给你食邑三万户。”周苛大骂道：“你倒是更应该赶快投降汉王，不然汉王很快就会俘虏你，你可不是汉王的对手!”项羽大怒，立刻下令煮死了周苛，把枞公也一起杀掉了。
The king of Han had entrusted the defence of Xingyang to his chief counsellor Zhou Ke,Lord Zong and Bao,once king of Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.).Zhou Ke and Lord Zong took counsel together and said,“A rebel king can hardly be trusted to defend the city.”There- upon they killed Bao. Then the Chu army stormed the city and captured Zhou Ke alive. "If you will serve as my general,I will make you a chief marshal with a fief of thirty thousand families,"said Xiang Yu. But Zhou Ke swore at him,"Unless you surrender soon,the king of Han will capture you.You are no match for him.” In a rage,Xiang Yu had him thrown into the cauldron and killed Lord Zong as well.

汉王之出荥阳，南走宛、叶,得九江王布,行收兵，复入保成皋。汉之四年,项王进兵围成皋。汉王逃,独与滕公出成皋北门，渡河走修武，从张耳、韩信军。诸将稍稍得出成皋，从汉王。楚遂拔成皋，欲西。汉使兵距之巩,令其不得西。
刘邦逃出荥阳以后，就一直向南奔到宛城、叶县，刚好九江王黥布归降，于是他们边走边收罗军队，又进入了成皋。汉王四年，项羽进兵围攻成皋。刘邦和滕公夏侯婴两个人开北门逃跑，渡过黄河到修武来投奔张耳与韩信。守成皋的其他将领也陆陆续续地逃出围城，来找刘邦。于是楚军攻下成皋，打算挥兵西进。刘邦赶紧派兵在巩县一带设防，从而制止了楚军的继续西行。
After escaping from Xingyang,the king of Han fled south to Wan and She.He won over Ying Bu,king of Jiujiang,and raised troops to defend Chenggao. In the fourth year of Han,Xiang Yu laid siege to Chenggao.The king fled alone with Lord Teng through the north gate,crossed the river and went to Xiuwu to join the army of Zhang Er and Han Xin. One by one his generals escaped from Chenggao and joined him.When the Chu army took Chenggao and started westwards,the king of Han sent troops to hold Gong and check their advance.

是时，彭越渡河击楚东阿，杀楚将军薛公。项王乃自东击彭越。汉王得淮阴侯兵，欲渡河南。郑忠说汉王,乃止壁河内。使刘贾将兵佐彭越，烧楚积聚。项王东击破之，走彭越。汉王则引兵渡河，复取成皋，军广武,就敖仓食。项王已定东海来西,与汉俱临广武而军,相守数月。
这时，彭越率兵渡过黄河，攻击楚国的东阿，杀死了楚将薛公。于是项羽不得不亲自领兵向东攻打彭越。刘邦夺得韩信的军队，想渡黄河南下。郎中郑忠出来劝阻，于是刘邦就让军队在河内暂时驻扎下来，只派刘贾带领一支人马去帮助彭越焚烧楚国的各种物资。项羽带兵东归后，与彭越交战，将他击退。而刘邦迅速地率兵渡过黄河，收复成皋，驻军广武山，取用敖仓的粮食。等到项羽稳定住东海郡的形势，再次回兵西进时，就只能与刘邦在荥阳城北的广武涧两军对峙了。就这样一直对峙了几个月。
At this point Peng Yue crossed the river and attacked Donga in Chu,killing the Chu general Lord Xue.So Xiang Yu turned east to fight Peng Yue.Now that the king of Han had Han Xin's army,he wanted to cross the Yellow River and head south,but on Zheng Zong's advice he stayed in his positions north of the river,sending LiuJia with troops to aid Peng Yue and burn the Chu supplies.In the east Xiang Yu de- feated Peng Yue and put him to flight. The king struck across the river and recaptured Chenggao,sta- tioned his army on Mount Guangwu and drew supplies from Aocang. Having conquered the land in the east,Xiang Yu marched west again. He,too,stationed his army opposite Mount Guangwu,confronting the forces of Han.This stalemate lasted for some months.

当此时，彭越数反梁地，绝楚粮食，项王患之。为高俎，置太公其上,告汉王曰：“今不急下,吾烹太公。”汉王曰：“吾与项羽俱北面受命怀王,约为兄弟,吾翁即若翁,必欲烹而翁，则幸分我一杯羹。”项王怒，欲杀之。项伯曰：“天下事未可知，且为天下者不顾家，虽杀之无益，只益祸耳。”项王从之。
这时候，项羽后方的彭越又杀出来，连续在大梁一带进行骚扰，掐断了楚军的粮草补给线，使得项羽大伤脑筋。于是他派人搭了一个高台，上设案板，把刘邦的父亲绑在案板上面，对着刘邦喊话说：“你要是还不赶紧投降，我就把你父亲煮了。”刘邦回答道：“当初我和你一道在怀王的驾下称臣，说好彼此以兄弟相待。这么说我的父亲也就是你的父亲。你要是煮你的父亲，就请分给我一碗肉汤喝!”项羽大怒，要杀刘太公。项伯劝他说：“现在天下的大局还看不出个结果，况且打天下的人都是不顾家的，你就是杀了太公也没用，白给自己招是非。”于是项羽只好作罢。
Meanswhile Peng Yue continued to rebel in Liang and to intercept the Chu army's grain supply,which seriously worried Xiang Yu.He had a high scaffold built on which he set the king of Han's father. "Surrender at once,or I shall boil your father alive!"he threatened. "Together we received King Huai's orders and swore to be brothers,"replied the king of Han."That makes my father yours as well.If you insist on boiling your own father,do send me a bowl of the soup!” In a great rage Xiang Yu prepared to kill the old man,but Xiang Bo reasoned with him saying,"It is not yet settled who will win the empire,and a man who aspires to be emperor will not trouble about his family.Killing him could serve no purpose but only make for trouble." Xiang Yu listened to his advice.

楚汉久相持未决，丁壮苦军旅,老弱罢转漕。项王谓汉王曰：“天下匈匈数岁者,徒以吾两人耳。愿与汉王挑战决雌雄,毋徒苦天下之民父子为也。”汉王笑谢曰：“吾宁斗智，不能斗力。”项王令壮士出挑战，汉有善骑射者楼烦,楚挑战三合,楼烦辄射杀之。项王大怒，乃自被甲持戟挑战。楼烦欲射之，项王瞋目叱之，楼烦目不敢视，手不敢发，遂走还入壁，不敢复出。汉王使人间问之,乃项王也。汉王大惊。于是项王乃即汉王，相与临广武涧而语。汉王数之”。项王怒，欲一战。汉王不听，项王伏弩射中汉王。汉王伤，走入成皋。
楚、汉两军在荥阳一带相持的时间很长，青壮年苦于当兵打仗，老弱之人苦于运输物资，于是项羽对着刘邦喊道：“百姓一连几年不得安宁，就是因为我们两个人，希望向汉王挑战，一决雌雄，别再让天下百姓的孩子大人们为我们受罪。”刘邦哈哈大笑说：“我要和你斗智，不和你比量匹夫之勇。”于是项羽派出一些武艺高强的人向刘邦的军队挑战。这时刘邦部下有一个楼烦神箭手，每当项羽的人出来，还来不及向刘邦的人挑战几次，就被这个神箭手射死了。项羽一见大怒，便自己披甲持戟冲了出来，神箭手搭箭正要再射，项羽瞪起眼睛向他大喝一声，那个神箭手被吓得眼也不敢看，箭也不敢发，掉头跑回营内，再也不敢出来了。刘邦很奇怪，赶紧派人出去打探，后来才知道刚才出来挑战的那个人就是项羽，这件事使刘邦也感到吃惊。项羽找了个机会靠近刘邦隔着广武涧两人对话。刘邦当面历数了项羽的十大罪状。项羽很生气，想和刘邦决一死战。刘邦不答应，于是项羽让预先埋伏的弓箭手射刘邦，刘邦被射中，逃进了成皋。
For a long time Chu and Han had battled yet neither had won a decisive victory.The able-bodied men were weary of fighting while the old and weak were exhausted by grain transportation.Xiang Yu made a proposal to the king of Han."Because of us,the empire has been in a tumult for years.Let us settle the issue now by hand-to-hand combat instead of involving all these other men.” The king declined with a smile. "I prefer to fight with my wits,"he said,“not with brute force.” 	Then Xiang Yu ordered his best fighters to challenge the men of Han to single combat.In the Han army there was a skilled mounted archer named Lou Fan,who with his arrows killed each Chu warrior after a few rounds of fighting.Xiang Yu in a fury buckled on armour himself and rode out with his halberd to do battle.As Lou Fan raised his bow,Xiang Yu glared and bellowed so fiercely that the bowman dared not meet his eyes or shoot but fled back to the rampart,too terrified to take the field again.When the king of Han sent to ask the reason and found that this warrior was Xiang Yuhimself,he was terrified. Xiang Yu called to the king across the lines on Mount Guangwu.The king enumerated Xiang Yu's faults,while Xiang Yu angrily challenged him to a fight,but his challenge was not accepted.Then Xiang Yu shot him with a crossbow he had concealed,and the king fled,wounded,to Chenggao.

项王闻淮阴侯已举河北，破齐,且欲击楚，乃使龙且往击之。淮阴侯与战，骑将灌婴击之,大破楚军，杀龙且。韩信因自立为齐王。项王闻龙且军破，则恐，使盱台人武涉往说淮阴侯。淮阴侯弗听。是时，彭越复反，下梁地，绝楚粮。项王乃谓海春侯大司马曹咎等曰：“谨守成皋，则汉欲挑战,慎勿与战，毋令得东而已。我十五日必诛彭越，定梁地，复从将军。”乃东，行击陈留、外黄。
不久，项羽听说刘邦的将领韩信平定河北之后，又攻破了齐国，下一步就要发兵对付楚国，便赶紧派了龙且去联合齐王田广共同抗击韩信。韩信与他交战，部将灌婴将其击败，龙且战死。韩信于是自己当了齐王。项羽听说龙且的军队被韩信歼灭，一时慌了神，便派盱眙人武涉去劝诱韩信脱离刘邦，韩信不听。与此同时，彭越又在他的后方折腾起来，攻占了大梁一带，断绝了楚军的粮草。项羽就对海春侯大司马曹咎等说：“你们好好地替我守着成皋，不管汉军怎么向你们挑战，你们也不要理他。你们只要能挡住他们，别让他们东进就行。我保证在十五天内消灭彭越，稳定好大梁一带的形势，而后立即回到这里来。”说罢，遂率军东下，并顺路对被彭越军队占领的陈留、外黄发起了攻击。
Soon, when Xiang Yu learned that Han Xin had conquered the land north of the Yellow River,defeated the armies of Qi and Zhao and was about to invade Chu,he sent General LongJu to attack him.Han Xin and Guan Ying,the cavalry commander,struck back and utterly routed the Chu army,killing LongJu.Han Xin then set himself up as king of Qi.Alarmed to hear of General Long Ju's defeat,Xiang Yu sent Wu She,a native of Xuyi,to win Han Xin over,but with no success. Meanwhile Peng Yue had reconquered Liang and cut the Chu army's supply route.Xiang Yu told his high marshal Cao Jiu,marquis of Haichun,and the other generals,"See you defend Chenggao well.If the Han army challenges you,do not give battle.Simply stop them advancing eastwards.In fifteen days,when I have killed Peng Yue and retaken Liang,I shall join you again.” He marched east and attacked Chenliu and Waihuang on the way.

外黄不下。数日，已降，项王怒，悉令男子年十五已上诣城东，欲坑之。外黄令舍人儿年十三,往说项王曰：“彭越强劫外黄,外黄恐，故且降,待大王。大王至，又皆坑之，百姓岂有归心?从此以东，梁地十余城皆恐，莫肯下矣。”项王然其言，乃赦外黄当坑者。东至睢阳,闻之皆争下项王。
开始，外黄的守敌很顽强，坚守了好几天。等到攻下之后，项羽生气地下令要把全城所有十五岁以上的男人通通集合到城东活埋。这时外黄县令的一个门客的儿子才十三岁，他跑去找项羽说：“彭越靠着武力威逼外黄人，外黄人害怕，暂且投降彭越，以等待大王您的到来。如今您来了，又要把他们活埋。这样一来，其他地方的百姓们谁还有心归顺您呢?从这儿往东，梁地还有十好几座城被彭越占着，那里的人们恐怕没有一个再会投降您。”项羽觉着他说得有理，就把那些要活埋的人全部释放了。从此往东一直到睢阳，沿路的敌人一听说项羽来到，就都纷纷缴械投降了。
but Waihuang held out against him for several days before it finally surrendered.In his rage he ordered all the men above fifteen to be taken to the east of the city,where he meant to have them massacred. The thirteen-year-old son of the magistrate's steward went to him and said,"Peng Yue forced Waihuang to rebel,and because the city was afraid it submitted to him,waiting for Your Highness to come to the rescue.But now that you are here you want to butcher our men. How can you win the hearts ofthe people like this?East of here there are more than a dozen cities of Liang,and now they will all be afraid to surrender to you.” Xiang Yu saw the truth in what this lad said,and pardoned those who were to have been massacred.When this became known,all the cities east to Suiyang promptly surrendered.

汉果数挑楚军战，楚军不出。使人辱之，五六日，大司马怒，渡兵汜水。士卒半渡，汉击之，大破楚军，尽得楚国货赂。大司马咎、长史欣皆自刭汜水上。大司马咎者，故蕲狱掾，长史欣亦故栎阳狱吏，两人尝有德于项梁，是以项王信任之。当是时，项王在睢阳，闻海春侯军败，则引兵还。汉军方围钟离眛于荥阳东,项王至，汉军畏楚，尽走险阻。
成皋方面，汉军果然向楚军挑战，开始楚军遵照项羽的嘱咐，坚壁不出。刘邦就派人故意对楚军百般辱骂。一连五六天，终于把大司马曹咎惹急了，他率兵渡过汜水，向汉军冲击。当楚军渡过一半的时候，汉军对楚军发起了总攻，结果楚军被打得大败。楚军的一切财宝货物全被刘邦缴获了。大司马曹咎、长史司马欣都自杀在汜水边上。大司马曹咎过去曾当过蕲县的典狱官，长史司马欣过去曾在栎阳管理过监狱。两个人都对项梁有恩，所以项羽分外信任他们。这时，项羽正在睢阳，听到曹咎兵败的消息后，马上带兵返回。汉军正把楚将钟离眛围困在荥阳城东，项羽一到，汉军就吓得赶紧逃走，都跑到险要的地方躲起来。
The Han army challenged the Chu troops in Chenggao several times,but they would not be drawn.Then men were sent to insult them,until after five or six days the high marshal Cao Jiu lost his temper and started leading his men across the River Si.When half the army was across,the men of Han attakced and routed them,capturing all the treasure of the kingdom of Chu.The high marshal Cao Jiu,the secretary Dong Yiand Sima Xin,king of Sai,killed themselves by the river.Cao Jiu,former gaoler of Qi,and Sima Xin,former gaoler of Yueyang,had been trusted by Xiang Yu because of the help they had once given Xiang Liang. At this time Xiang Yu was at Suiyang.When he learned of his army's defeat he led his troops back.The soldiers of Han were besieg- ing Zhongli Mo east of Xingyang.At Xiang Yu's approach,they with- drew in fear to the heights.

是时，汉兵盛食多，项王兵罢食绝。汉遣陆贾说项王，请太公,项王弗听。汉王复使侯公往说项王，项王乃与汉约，中分天下，割鸿沟以西者为汉，鸿沟而东者为楚。项王许之，即归汉王父母妻子。军皆呼万岁。汉王乃封侯公为平国君,匿弗肯复见。曰：“此天下辩士，所居倾国,故号为平国君。”项王已约，乃引兵解而东归。
这时，汉军方面人多粮足，而楚军方面则是兵疲粮尽。刘邦派陆贾去见项羽，请他放回太公，项羽不答应。刘邦于是又派侯公去向项羽游说，项羽终于同意与刘邦订立条约，二人平分天下：鸿沟以西的地盘归刘邦，鸿沟以东的地盘属项羽。项羽同意了这个协定，随即把刘邦的父亲和妻子都放了回去。汉军一见刘邦的家属回了汉营，都欢呼万岁。刘邦封侯公为平国君，但自己却躲着不愿见他。他说：“这个人是耍嘴皮子的天才，他在哪个国家，哪个国家就得灭亡。所以特地给他来了个正好相反的封号叫作平国君。”项羽签订条约后，就带着军队撤离前线，准备回自己东方的领地。
Now the Han army was strong and had ample supplies,while Xiang Yu's troops were exhausted and had no food.The king of Han dispatched LuJia to ask Xiang Yu to send his father back,but Xiang Yu refused.Then the king sentLord Hou to persuade him.This time Xiang Yu agreed to divide the empire into two.The land west of Honggou should go to Han,that east of Honggou to Chu.This agreement reached,Xiang Ye handed over the king's father and wife,while all the soldiers cheered.The king of Han called Lord Hou the Leveller of States,but would not let him appear again. This man is the world's greatest orator,"he explained."Wherever he goes,he causes kingdoms to fall.That is why I call him the leveller of states.” After making this agreement,Xiang Yu led his army east.

汉欲西归，张良、陈平说曰：“汉有天下太半,而诸侯皆附之。楚兵罢食尽，此天亡楚之时也，不如因其机而遂取之。今释弗击，此所谓‘养虎自遗患’也。”汉王听之。汉五年,汉王乃追项王至阳夏南,止军，与淮阴侯韩信、建成侯彭越期会而击楚军。至固陵,而信、越之兵不会。楚击汉军，大破之。汉王复入壁，深堑而自守。谓张子房曰：“诸侯不从约,为之奈何!”对曰：“楚兵且破，信、越未有分地,其不至固宜。君王能与共分天下,今可立致也。即不能，事未可知也。君王能自陈以东傅海,尽与韩信;睢阳以北至穀城,以与彭越：使各自为战，则楚易败也。”汉王曰：“善。”于是乃发使者告韩信、彭越曰：“并力击楚。楚破，自陈以东傅海与齐王，睢阳以北至縠城与彭相国。”使者至，韩信、彭越皆报曰：“请今进兵。”韩信乃从齐往，刘贾军从寿春并行,屠城父，至垓下。大司马周殷叛楚,以舒屠六,举九江兵随刘贾、彭越皆会垓下，诣项王。
刘邦也准备撤军西行，张良、陈平对刘邦说：“我们已经占据了整个天下的一大半，许多诸侯都已经倾向了我们。项羽已经兵疲粮尽，这是老天爷要灭亡楚国的时候。我们不如干脆乘这时机灭了他。如果现在错过不打，那可真成了俗话说的‘留着老虎让它日后咬我们’。”刘邦采纳了他们的意见。汉王五年，刘邦率军追击项羽，追到阳夏南面才停了下来。他约定好了时间让淮阴侯韩信、建成侯彭越和他一起进击项羽。不料当刘邦率军前进到固陵的时候，韩信和彭越的军队都没到，于是项羽趁机反攻汉军，汉军大败。刘邦只好退入营垒，深挖沟堑，坚守不出。刘邦问张良：“诸侯们不按约定办，这怎么好呢?”张良说：“项羽眼看着就要被消灭了，可是韩信、彭越还没有得到增加封地的允诺，因此他们不来是很自然的。您要是能够舍得与他们共分天下，那马上可以把他们召来；要是您舍不得，那对付项羽的事情就很难说了。您要是能把从陈县往东直到海边的地盘全给韩信，把从睢阳往北一直到穀城的地盘全给彭越，让他们都去为了取得自己的地盘而作战，那时项羽就很容易打败了。”刘邦说：“好。”于是派使者分头去告诉韩信、彭越说：“请你们合力攻楚，打下楚地以后，自陈县往东一直到海边的地盘都给齐王，睢阳以北一直到穀城的地盘都给彭相国。”结果传令的使者一到，韩信和彭越都立刻说：“我们马上就进兵。”于是韩信的军队从齐国开来，刘贾的军队从寿春同时发兵，沿途夷平城父县后来到垓下。楚国大司马周殷也背叛了项羽，他领着舒县的军队屠灭了六县，又汇合了九江王黥布的军队，和刘贾、彭越一起先后会师于垓下，直逼项羽的大营。
The king of Han prepared to go west,but Zhang Liang and Chen Ping advised against this saying,"You now have the greater half of the empire and the support of all the states,while the army of Chu is exhausted and has no food.Heaven has decreed Xiang Yu's downfall. You should seize this opportunity to crush him.To let Xiang Yu go now would be like bringing up a tiger—simply asking for trouble in future.” The king took their advice. In the fifth year of Han,the king pursued Xiang Yu to south of Yangxia and stationed his troops there,appointing a date to attack with Han Xin,marquis of Huaiyin,and Peng Yue,marquis of Jiancheng. But when he reached Guling their armies failed to appear.Xiang Yu attacked and defeated the men of Han,who retreated to their ram- parts and strengthened their defences. "The marquiese have failed me.What shall I do?"the king of Han asked Zhang Liang. "Chu is about to be crushed,but Han Xin and Peng Yue have not been given fiefs,"replied Zhang Liang."No wonder they stayed away. If you will divide the empire with them,they will come immediately. If not,the issue is by no means certain.Give Han Xin the land from Chen east to the coast,give Peng Yue the land from Suiyang north to Gucheng,so that they will be fighting for themselves.Then Chu can easily be defeated.” "Very good,"said the king of Han. He sent envoys to inform Han Xin and Peng Yue,"If you join us to attack Chu,I will give all the land between Chen and the sea to Han Xin,king of Qi,all that between Suiyang and Gucheng to Chancellor Peng Yue when Xiang Yu is defeated.” After the envoys reached them,Han Xin and Peng Yue agreed to send troops at once.Han Xin advanced from Qiwhile Liu Jia led his army from Shouchun,took Chengfu and wiped out its defenders.Then both forces reached Gaixia.Marshal Zhou Yin also rebelled against Xiang Yu and marched from Shu to take Liu and massacre its defenders. In addition,the army of Ying Bu,king of Jiujiang,followed the armies of Liu Jia and Peng Yue.These forces converged upon Xiang Yu at Gaixia.

项王军壁垓下，兵少食尽，汉军及诸侯兵围之数重。夜闻汉军四面皆楚歌,项王乃大惊，曰：“汉皆已得楚乎?是何楚人之多也!”项王则夜起，饮帐中。有美人名虞,常幸从；骏马名骓,常骑之。于是项王乃悲歌杭慨，自为诗曰：“力拔山兮气盖世，时不利兮骓不逝。骓不逝兮可奈何，虞兮虞兮奈若何!”歌数阕,美人和之。项王泣数行下，左右皆泣，莫能仰视。
项羽的军队驻扎在垓下，兵力很少，粮食也没有了，刘邦的军队和各路诸侯的军队合在一起，把他们层层围住。深夜里四面的汉军都在唱着楚地的歌谣，项羽听到后吃惊地说：“莫非汉军已把楚国全部占领了么?要不然他们的军中怎么有这么多楚人呢?”于是披衣起来，在帐中饮酒浇愁。当时他身边有一个美人名字叫虞，深受项羽宠爱.几年来一直跟在他身边。还有一匹骏马名字叫骓，这是项羽冲锋陷阵一直骑乘的。项羽面对着这凄凉的局面，不由得感慨万分，他作歌道：“力能拔山啊.豪气盖世，时运不利啊，骓马不再奔驰。不再奔驰啊.又有何方?虞姬虞姬啊，我把你怎样安放!”他一连唱了好几遍，虞美人也和着唱了一首。这时项羽泪如雨下，左右将士们也一个个涕泣唏嘘，谁都不忍心抬头仰视。
Xiang Yu's army at Gaixia,with only a handful of troops and right out of supplies,was hemmed in by the men of Han and the other states.At night he heard the besiegers all about him singing Chu songs. "Has Han already conquered Chu?"he asked in dismay."They have so many men of Chu with them!” He rose that night to drink in his tent.With him was the lovely Lady Yu,who followed wherever he went,and Zhui,the swift steed which he always rode.Now Xiang Yuchanted a tragic air,setting words to it himself: My strength uprooted mountains, My spirit overtopped the world; But the times are against me, And Zhui can gallop no more. When Zhui can gallop no more What can I do? And what is to become Of Lady Yu? He sang this song several times, and Lady Yu joined in. Tears coursed down his cheeks, while all his followers wept and bowed their heads in sorrow.

于是项王乃上马骑,麾下壮士骑从者八百余人,直夜溃围南出,驰走。平明，汉军乃觉之，令骑将灌婴以五千骑追之。项王渡淮，骑能属者百余人耳。项王至阴陵,迷失道，问一田父，田父绐曰“左”。左，乃陷大泽中，以故汉追及之。项王乃复引兵而东，至东城,乃有二十八骑。汉骑追者数千人。项王自度不得脱，谓其骑曰：“吾起兵至今八岁矣，身七十余战,所当者破，所击者服，未尝败北，遂霸有天下。然今卒困于此，此天之亡我，非战之罪也。今日固决死，愿为诸君快战”,必三胜之,为诸君溃围，斩将，刈旗。令诸君知天亡我，非战之罪也。”乃分其骑以为四队，四向。汉军围之数重。项王谓其骑曰：“吾为公取彼一将。”令四面骑驰下，期山东为三处。于是项王大呼驰下，汉军皆披靡，遂斩汉一将。是时赤泉侯为骑将,追项王。项王瞋目而叱之，赤泉侯人马俱惊，辟易数里。与其骑会为三处。汉军不知项王所在，乃分军为三，复围之。项王乃驰，复斩汉一都尉，杀数十百人。复聚其骑，亡其两骑耳。乃谓其骑曰：“何如?”骑皆伏，曰：“如大王言。”
于是项羽上马准备突围，这时帐下的骑兵还有八百多人跟着他。他们乘着夜半时分冲出了包围圈，一直向南疾驰。到天快亮的时候.汉军才发觉。刘邦命令骑将灌婴率领五千骑兵追赶项羽。等到项羽渡过淮河，跟着他的骑兵就只剩下一百来人了。项羽跑到阴陵县时，迷失了道路。他向一个农民打听，这个农民骗他说“往左拐”。项羽向左一拐，结果陷在了大泥塘里。就因为这一耽误，后面灌婴的追兵就赶了上来。项羽又领兵向东.到达东城.这时项羽身边只剩下了二十八人。而刘邦派来的追兵有好几千。项羽自己估计着这回是无法脱险了，就对随从们说：“自从我起兵到现在已经八年了，我曾身经七十多场大战，所向披靡，没有失败过一次，于是成为天下的霸主。想不到今天竟然被困在这里.这是老天爷要灭亡我，不是我不会打仗。今天肯定要决一死战，我要为你们诸位再痛痛快快地打一仗，一定要连胜它几回，我要为你们突破重围，杀死追将，砍倒敌旗，让你们明白，这是老天爷要灭亡我，不是我不会打仗!”说罢就把二十八个人分成了四组，各自分别朝着一个方向。这时汉军已经把他们围了好几层。项羽对他的骑兵们说：“看我给你们杀他一个将领!”他命令四个小组分别朝四个方向冲出，并约定好大家在山的东面分三处集合。然后项羽大吼一声拍马冲了出去，汉军一看吓得纷纷倒退，于是项羽杀掉了一个汉军将领。当时，赤泉侯杨喜正给刘邦当骑将，他在后面追赶项羽。项羽回头瞪起眼睛，大喝一声，吓得杨喜连人带马向后退出好几里地。项羽果然和他的部下分三个地方集合了。汉军弄不清项羽在哪一处，于是只好把追兵分成三股，分别包围了项羽的三个集合点。这时项羽忽然又冲出来杀死了汉军的一个都尉，杀死了汉军士兵近百人。而后把自己的人集合起来一清点，发现只少了两个。项羽问他的部下说：“怎么样?"大家都敬佩地说：“果然像大王说的一样!”
Then he mounted his horse and rode into the night with little more than eight hundred staunch followers.Breaking through the enemy lines to the south,they galloped away. By dawn the Han army knew that he had escaped,and the cavalry officer Guan Ying was sent with five thousand horsemen in pursuit.By the time Xiang Yu crossed the River Huai,there were little more than a hundred horsemen with him.At Yinling he lost his way and asked an old man in the fields to direct him."Bear left!"The old man deliber- ately deceived him,and going left he was bogged down in the marshes so that the Han cavalry came up with him. So Xiang Yu turned back east to Dongcheng.By now only twenty- eight horsemen remained with him,while his pursuers numbered sev- eral thousand.He knew that he could not escape and told his men: "It is eight years since I rose in arms.In that time I have fought more than seventy battles.I swept all obstacles from my path,con- quered every foe I attacked,and was never defeated.That is how I won the empire.But now suddenly I am hemmed in here.This is because Heaven is against me and not because my generalship is at fault.Today I shall perish here,but for your sake I shall fight gallantly and overcome the enemy three times.For you I shall break through their lines,kill their commander and cut down their flag,so that you may know it is Heaven that has destroyed me,not my generalship that is fault.”He divided his horsemen into four groups,facingin four directions. The Han forces had surrounded them on all sides. "Watch me kill one of their commanders for you!"he cried.He ordered his men to gallop down in four directions and reas- semble in three groups east of the hill.Then with a mighty battle-cry he charged.The Han troops scattered before him and he struck down one of their commanders.A cavalry commander named Yang Xi,the marquis of Chiquan,pursued him.But Xiang Yu glared and bellowed at him so fiercely that Yang Xi's horse bolted and fled,terrified,for several . Xiang Yu rejoined his men,who by now had reassembled in three groups.The Han forces,not knowing which group he was in,divided into three to surround them again.Once more Xiang Yucharged through their lines and killed a military tribune as well as several dozen men. When he allied his followers again,he had lost only two of them. "How was that?"he asked. His men bowed and replied,"You were as good as your word, Your Majesty."

于是项王乃欲东渡乌江。乌江亭长权船待,谓项王曰：“江东虽小，地方千里，众数十万人，亦足王也。愿大王急渡。今独臣有船，汉军至，无以渡。”项王笑曰：“天之亡我，我何渡为!且籍与江东子弟八千人渡江而西，今无一人还；纵江东父兄怜而王我，我何面目见之?纵彼不言，籍独不愧于心乎!”乃谓亭长曰：“吾知公长者。吾骑此马五岁，所当无敌，尝一日行千里.不忍杀之，以赐公。”乃令骑皆下马步行，持短兵接战。独籍所杀汉军数百人，项王身亦被十余创。顾见汉骑司马吕马童,曰：“若非吾故人乎?”马童面之,指王翳曰：“此项王也。”项王乃曰：“吾闻汉购我头千金，邑万户,吾为若德。”乃自刎而死。王翳取其头，余骑相蹂践争项王，相杀者数十人。最其后，郎中骑杨喜、骑司马吕马童、郎中吕胜、杨武各得其一体。五人共会其体，皆是，故分其地为五:封吕马童为中水侯,封王翳为杜衍侯，封杨喜为赤泉侯,封杨武为吴防侯，封吕胜为涅阳侯。
这时，项羽带着他的二十几个人到了乌江浦，准备东渡。乌江亭的亭长驾着一只小船靠在岸边，对项羽说：“江东虽小，可也还有纵横上千里的地盘，还有民众几十万，也足够您称王的。请您赶紧上船过江。这里只我一个人有船，汉军追到这里，他们也无法渡过江去。”项羽笑道：“既然老天爷要灭亡我，我还渡江干什么!想当初我渡江西下时曾带着江东子弟八千人，如今竟没有一个活着回来；即使江东父老们可怜我，还拥戴我为王，我又有什么脸面去见他们呢?就算人家什么也不说，难道我自己就不问心有愧吗?”接着他又对亭长说：“我知道您是好人。我骑这匹马已经五年了，所向无敌，它能一日奔驰千里，我不忍心杀它，就把它送给您吧。”说罢命令所有的人都下马步行，手持短兵与汉军接战。光是项羽一个人就杀死了汉兵好几百，而项羽自己身上也有十余处受了伤。最后项羽回头看见了汉军的骑司马吕马童，项羽向他招呼说：“那不是我的老朋友吕马童吗?”吕马童定睛一看，立刻指着项羽对王翳说：“这人就是项王!”项羽对他们说："我听说刘邦曾悬赏千金，万户的封地买我的人头，我今天就成全你们吧!”说罢自刎而死。王翳赶紧奔过去割下了项羽的人头，其余的骑兵蜂拥而上去抢项羽的尸体，单是为了争夺打架互相拥挤践踏，就死了好几十人。最后，郎中骑杨喜、骑司马吕马童、郎中吕胜、杨武分别抢到项羽的一条腿或一只手。他们四个和王翳五个人把手里的残肢凑在一起，可以确认都是项羽的。于是刘邦就把当初悬赏的万户封邑一分为五，封吕马童为中水侯，封王翳为杜衍侯，封杨喜为赤泉侯，封杨武为吴防侯，封吕胜为涅阳侯。
Xiang Yunow considered crossing the River Wujiang and going to the east of the Yangtse.The station master there had a boat moored and waiting."There is not much land east of the Yangtse,"he said to Xiang Yu.""But a thousand square liand several hundred thousand men are enough for a kingdom.You must cross quickly,Your Highness! Mine is the only boat here.When the Han army comes,they will not be able to cross." "Heaven is against me,"replied Xiang Yu with a laugh."What use is it to cross the river?Besides,I once crossed the Yangtse and went west with eight thousand young men from the east,but now I have come back alone.Even if the elders made me king out of pity,how could I face them again?Though they said nothing,how could I hold up my head?”He turned to the station master."I can see you are a worthy man.For five years I have ridden this horse,sweeping all be- fore me,often galloping a thousand liin one day.I cannot bear to kill him.I give him to you.” He ordered his men to dismount for hand-to-hand combat.Xiang Yu alone killed several hundred men of Han and was wounded some dozen times.Then,turning to see the cavalry officer Lü Matong,he exclaimed: "Isn’t that my old friend Lu?" Lü Matong,facing him,pointed him out to Wang Yi. “There is Xiang Yu!” Xiang Yu said,"I hear the king of Han has offered a reward of a thousand gold pieces and a fief of ten thousand families for my head. Let me do you a good turn!”With that he cut his own throat. Wang Yi seized his head,while the other horsemen trampled and jostled each other for his body—several dozen of them fought and killed each other.Finally a cavalryman of the guard,Yang Xi,the cav- ally marshal Lü Matong,and the knights Lü Sheng and Yang Wu se- cured one limb each.When the five of them fitted the limbs together, it was seen that they were indeed those of Xiang Yu,and the fief was divided among them.Lü Matong was made marguis of Zhongshui, Wang Yimarquis of Duyan,Yang Xi marquis of Chiquan,Yang Wu marquis of Wufang,and Lü Sheng marquis of Nieyang.

项王已死，楚地皆降汉，独鲁不下。汉乃引天下兵欲屠之。为其守礼义，为主死节,乃持项王头视鲁,鲁父兄乃降。始，楚怀王初封项籍为鲁公，及其死，鲁最后下，故以鲁公礼葬项王縠城。汉王为发哀，泣之而去。
项羽死后，楚国的地面都相继投降了刘邦，这时只有鲁城曲阜拒不投降。刘邦生气地想要发兵把它夷平，后来考虑到曲阜的军民所以如此，是出于他们守礼义，忠于其主，于是就派人拿着项羽的人头去给曲阜的百姓们看，曲阜的父老们才向刘邦投降。起初.楚怀王曾封项羽为鲁公，等到项羽死后，鲁城曲阜又最后投降，所以刘邦就用鲁公的礼仪把项羽安葬在了穀城。刘邦也亲自前来为项羽哭了一场。
After Xiang Yu's death all the districts in Chu surrendered except Lu.The king of Han prepared to muster the troops of the whole country to massacre the inhabitants.But because they had proved loyal and ready to die for their master,Xiang Yu's head was displayed to them.And thereupon the elders of Lu surrendered. As King Huai of Chu had made Xiang Yu lord of Lu and this district was the last to surrender after his death,Xiang Yu was buried at Gucheng with the rites befitting the lord of Lu.The king of Han, before leaving,conducted the funeral in person and shed tears.

诸项氏枝属，汉王皆不诛。乃封项伯为射阳侯,桃侯、平皋侯、玄武侯,皆项氏，赐姓刘。
项羽的家族同姓，刘邦都不杀。项伯因救刘邦有功，被封为射阳侯。此外桃侯、平皋侯、玄武侯，也都是项家的人，刘邦特意恩赏让他们都姓刘。
Instead of punishing Xiang Yu's kinsmen,the king made Xiang Bo marquis of Yiyang.The marquises of Tao,Pinggao and Xuanwu,all of whom belonged to the Xiang clan,were given the royal surname Liu.

太史公曰：吾闻之周生曰“舜目盖重瞳子”,又闻项羽亦重瞳子，羽岂其苗裔邪?何兴之暴也!夫秦失其政，陈涉首难,豪杰蜂起，相与并争，不可胜数。然羽非有尺寸,乘势起陇亩之中,三年遂将五诸侯灭秦,分裂天下，而封王侯，政由羽出,号称霸王，位虽不终，近古以来未尝有也。及羽背关怀楚,放逐义帝而自立，怨王侯叛己，难矣。自矜功伐,奋其私智而不师古,谓霸王之业，欲以力征经营天下，五年卒亡其国，身死东城,尚不觉寤，而不自责，过矣。乃引“天亡我，非用兵之罪也”,岂不谬哉!
太史公说：我先前曾听周先生说过舜的每只眼睛都有两个瞳孔.又听说项羽也有两个瞳孔，项羽莫非是舜的后代吗?不然怎么会兴起得这么突然呢?秦朝暴虐无道。陈涉首先起兵发难。各地豪杰都蜂拥而起，各自为政，你争我夺，不胜枚举。而项羽并没有尺寸的封地为根基，以一个平民百姓的身份拔地而起，结果不出三年，就率领着东方的诸侯们灭掉了秦朝，接着他切割土地，分封王侯，所有政令都由项羽一人发布，自己号称"西楚霸王".他的事业虽然没能善始善终，但像他这样轰轰烈烈的，也是近古以来所没有的。可是后来他不建都关中.却非要回到楚国，又驱逐义帝而以自己为尊，这时候再埋怨王侯们背叛他，那就很难啦!他夸耀自己的战功，只知道一意孤行而不吸取古代的历史经验，只想着成为一代霸主，只想着用武力征伐经营天下，结果五年的时间，国灭身亡。到临死的时候还不悔悟，还不知道责备自己，还说什么“这是老天爷要灭亡我.不是我不会打仗”,这不是太荒谬了吗!
The Grand Historian comments:I heard from the scholar Zhou that Emperor Shun had double pupils in his eyes,and they say Xiang Yu was the same.Does this mean that he was a descendant of Shun? His rise was remarkably sudden.When the Qin government abused its power and Chen She started a rebellion,the brave men who flocked to him were too many to count.Xiang Yu had no inch of territory at the start,yet,taking this chance to rise in the countryside,within three years he commanded five states and overthrew the House of Qin.He carved up the empire and enfeoffed kings and barons.He was supreme,styl- ing himself the Overlord,and though his rule did not endure his achievement was surely unique in recent times. But when he gave up the land within the Pass to return to Chu,banished the Righteous Emperor and set himself up in his stead,he could hardly complain when the kings and barons turned against him. He boasted of his conquests,trusted only his personal judgement and did not follow ancient precedents.Considering himself the overlord, he tried to win the empire by military conquest,so that within five years he lost his kingdom and met his death at Dongcheng.Yet he never realized his mistake or blamed himself for his folly.What a foolhe was to say that Heaven was against him and that it was not his generalship that was at fault!
