汉兴，接秦之弊，丈夫从军旅，老弱转粮饟，作业剧而财匮。
汉朝兴起时，承接秦朝的弊端，男子参军打仗，老弱者运输粮草，劳作繁重而财力匮乏。
When the Han arose, inheriting the troubles of Qin, men joined the military, the old and weak transported grain and supplies, work was intense and finances were depleted.

自天子不能具钧驷，而将相或乘牛车，齐民无藏盖。
连天子都不能配齐四匹马的车队，将相有的乘坐牛车，百姓没有储蓄。
Even the Son of Heaven could not assemble a full team of four horses, ministers sometimes rode ox-carts, and common people had no savings.
