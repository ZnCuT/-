魏公子无忌者，魏昭王少子而魏安釐王异母弟也。昭王薨，安釐王即位，封公子为信陵君。是时范睢亡魏相秦，以怨魏齐故，秦兵围大梁，破魏华阳下军，走芒卯。魏王及公子患之。
魏公子无忌，是魏昭王的小儿子、魏安釐王的同父异母弟弟。魏昭王死后，魏安釐王即位，赐封公子为信陵君。这时候范睢从魏国逃到秦国做宰相，因为怨恨魏齐，秦军包围了大梁，攻破了魏国华阳的驻军，赶跑了芒卯。魏王和公子都为此担忧。
Lord Xinling, Wuji, younger son of King Zhao of Wei and step-brother of King An Xi, was made Lord Xinling when King Zhao died and King An Xi succeeded to the throne. At that time Fan Sui had fled from Wei to become the prime minister of Qin; and because he hated Wei Qi, the Qin armies besieged the Wei capital Daliang and routed the forces of Wei at Huayang, putting General Mang Mao to flight. The king of Wei and Lord Xinling were sorely troubled.

公子为人仁而下士，士无贤不肖皆谦而礼交之，不敢以其富贵骄士。士以此方数千里争往归之，致食客三千人。当是时，诸侯以公子贤，多客，不敢加兵谋魏十余年。
公子为人仁厚，尊重士人，士人无论是才能高的还是才能低的，他都很谦恭地以礼相交，不敢因为自己的富贵而傲慢对待士人。因此方圆数千里内的士人争着投奔他，食客达到三千人。在这时，各诸侯国因为公子贤明，宾客又多，不敢进兵对付魏国有十多年。
Lord Xinling was a kindly, unassuming man, who showed courtesy to all he met whether they had talent or not and did not stand on his dignity because of his wealth and position. So followers flocked to him from hundreds of li around until he had about three thousand protégés; and when the other feudal lords saw his ability and the number of his supporters, they dared not attack Wei. Thus more than ten years passed without further alarms.

公子与魏王博，而北境传举烽，言“赵寇至，且入界。”魏王释博，欲召大臣谋。公子止王曰：“赵王田猎耳，非为寇也。”
公子和魏王在下棋，北方边境传来消息点燃了烽火，说“赵国的敌寇到了，将要进入边界”。魏王放下棋具，想召集大臣商议。公子制止魏王说：“赵王只是在打猎，不是来进攻的。”
One day Lord Xinling was playing draughts with the king of Wei when word was brought that beacon fires had been lit on the northern border and the king of Zhao was about to invade their territory. The king rose from the table to summon a council of ministers at once, but Lord Xinling stopped him. “The king of Zhao is only out hunting,” he assured him. “This is no invasion.”

The king rose from the table to summon a council of ministers at once, but Lord Xinling stopped him. “The king of Zhao is only out hunting,” he assured him. “This is no invasion.”

倪，故久立，与其客语，微察公子。公子颜色愈和。当是时，魏将相宗室宾客满堂，待公子举酒。市人皆观公子执辔。从骑皆窃骂侯生。侯生视公子色终不变，乃谢客就车。
侯生故意久久地站着和朋友说话，暗中观察公子。公子的神色更加温和。当时，魏国的将相、王亲宾客满堂，等着公子开宴。市场上的人都看见公子亲自执缰驾车，随从骑士都在暗骂侯生。侯生见公子的神色始终没有变化，于是向朋友告辞，上了车。
Hou Ying purposely lingered for a long time chatting to a friend, secretly observing Lord Xinling, who only became more composed and courteous. Meanwhile the generals, ministers, nobles, and protégés of Wei who crowded Lord Xinling’s hall were waiting for him to begin the feast. The people in the market all saw him holding the reins himself, while his outriders muttered curses at Hou Ying. When Hou Ying saw that Lord Xinling’s expression never changed, he finally took leave of his friend and mounted the chariot.

至家，公子引侯生坐上坐，遍赞宾客，宾客皆惊。酒酣，公子起，为寿侯生前。侯生因谓公子曰：“今日嬴之为公子亦足矣。嬴乃夷门抱关者也，而公子亲枉车骑，自迎嬴于众人广坐之中，不宜有所过，今公子故过之。
到了家中，公子请侯生坐上座，又逐一向宾客介绍他，宾客都很惊讶。酒喝得正尽兴时，公子站起来在侯生面前敬酒祝寿。侯生于是对公子说：“今天我侯嬴为难公子也算够了。我只是夷门的守门人，可是公子却亲自委屈车驾，在大庭广众之中迎接我，本来是不应如此过礼的，如今公子却偏要如此。”
Upon reaching his mansion, Lord Xinling invited Hou Ying to take the seat of honour and introduced him to all the guests, who were astonished. When the wine was at its height, Lord Xinling rose to toast him. Hou Ying then said: “I have put you to a hard test today, my lord. I am merely a warden at Yi Gate, yet you humbled your carriage and horses to fetch me personally in the midst of the public square. Such honour was more than my due, yet you insisted on granting it.”

然嬴欲就公子之名，故久立公子车骑市中，过客以观公子，公子愈恭。市人皆以嬴为小人，而以公子为长者能下士也。”于是罢酒，侯生遂为上客。
然而我侯嬴是想成就公子的名声，所以故意让公子的车马久停在市中，假托拜访朋友来观察公子，结果公子越发谦恭。市人都认为我侯嬴是小人，而认为公子是能够尊重士人的贤者长者。”酒宴就此结束，侯嬴遂成为公子的上客。
“But I wished to enhance your reputation, so I deliberately kept your carriage waiting in the market-place, pretending to visit a friend in order to observe you. Yet the more I tried your patience, the more courteous you became. The townsfolk despised me as a petty man, but honoured you as a true gentleman who could humble himself before scholars.” After this feast Hou Ying became one of Lord Xinling’s most honoured guests.

侯生谓公子曰：“臣所过屠者朱亥，此子贤者，世莫能知，故隐屠间耳。”
侯生又对公子说：“我刚才拜访的屠夫朱亥，他是个有才能的人，但世人却没有人能真正了解他，所以他才隐居在屠户之间。”
Hou Ying then said to Lord Xinling: “The butcher I visited just now is Zhu Hai. He is a man of great worth, yet the world does not recognize him; therefore, he keeps himself hidden among the butchers.”

公子往数请之，朱亥故不复谢。公子怪之。
公子多次前去拜访朱亥，朱亥却故意不再回拜。公子对此感到奇怪。
Lord Xinling called on Zhu Hai several times, but to his surprise the butcher showed no sign of appreciation.

魏安釐王二十年，秦昭王已破赵长平军，又进兵围邯郸。公子姊为赵惠文王弟平原君夫人，数遗魏王及公子书，请救于魏。
魏安釐王二十年（公元前277年），秦昭王已经攻破了赵国长平的军队，又进兵包围邯郸。公子的姐姐是赵惠文王的弟弟平原君的夫人，她多次送信给魏王和公子，请求魏国出兵救援。
In the twentieth year of King An Xi, King Zhao of Qin routed the army of Zhao at Changping and advanced to besiege Handan. Lord Xinling’s elder sister had married Lord Pingyuan, younger brother of King Huiwen of Zhao, and now she sent repeatedly to her brothers, the king of Wei and Lord Xinling, to beg for aid.

魏王使将军晋鄙将十万众救赵。秦王使使者告魏王曰：“吾攻赵，旦暮且下，而诸侯敢救者，已拔赵，必移兵先击之。”魏王恐，使人止晋鄙，留军壁邺，名为救赵，实持两端以观望。
魏王派将军晋鄙率十万大军去救赵。秦王派使者告诉魏王说：“我攻打赵国，早晚就要攻下；如果有诸侯敢来救赵，在我攻下赵国后，一定首先出兵攻打他。”魏王害怕了，派人阻止晋鄙，命他把军队留驻在邺城扎营，名义上是救赵，实际上是持两端而观望。
But when the king of Wei dispatched General Jin Bi with a hundred thousand men to Zhao’s assistance, the king of Qin sent an envoy to him with this warning: “Zhao is about to fall. If any other state dare go to its aid, I shall lead my troops against it as soon as I have conquered Zhao.” The panic-stricken king of Wei immediately ordered Jin Bi to advance no further but simply to garrison at Ye, ostensibly aiding Zhao while actually sitting on the fence.

平原君使者冠盖相属于魏，让魏公子曰：“胜所以自附为婚姻者，以公子之高义，为能急人之困。今邯郸旦暮降秦，而魏救不至，安在公子能急人之困也！且公子纵轻胜，弃之降秦，独不怜公子姊邪！”
平原君的使者车盖相继来到魏国，责备魏公子说：“我赵胜之所以高攀您，与您结为婚姻，是因为您高义，能急人所难。如今邯郸早晚就要投降秦国，而魏国的救兵还未到，您所谓急人所困在哪里呢？况且就算您轻视我赵胜，抛弃我让赵国投降秦国，难道您就不怜惜您的姐姐吗？”
Then carriage after carriage of envoys came from Lord Pingyuan to Wei. “I was eager to ally with you by marriage,” Lord Pingyuan reproached Lord Xinling, “because you were famed for your high-minded generosity and for helping those in distress. Now our capital may fall to Qin at any moment, but we have had no assistance from Wei. Is this your way of helping friends in need? Of course, you may think so poorly of me that you do not care if I fall captive to Qin; but have you no feeling for your sister?”

公子患之，数请魏王，还使门客、辩士用多种手段劝谏。
公子因此非常忧虑，多次请求魏王，还派门客和辩士用各种方式进谏。
Time and again, in great distress, Lord Xinling pleaded with the king and sent protégés and orators to reason with him; but for fear of Qin the king remained unmoved.

魏王及宾客辩士说王万端。魏王畏秦，终不听公子。
宾客与辩士们再三劝说魏王。魏王因为畏惧秦国，始终没有听从公子的建议。
The king of Wei was urged in every possible way by guests and debaters, but, fearing Qin, he would not listen to Lord Xinling.

公子自度终不能得之于王，计不独生而令赵亡，乃请宾客，约车骑百余乘，欲以客往赴秦军，与赵俱死。
公子心里揣度，终究不能从魏王那里得到支持，若只顾自己苟活，便会使赵国灭亡。于是他召集门客，准备了百余辆车马，打算率领门客前往秦军，与赵国共存亡。
Realizing that the king would not be persuaded, and unwilling to survive while Zhao perished, Lord Xinling mustered from among his retainers more than a hundred chariots and horsemen, intending to march against the army of Qin and die with Zhao.

行过夷门，见侯生，具告所以欲死秦军状。辞决而行。
他经过夷门时，见到了侯赢，把自己打算与秦军拼死的情况全都告诉了他，说完就告别上路。
Passing Yi Gate, he explained his intention of dying in battle against Qin to Hou Ying, then took his leave and set off.

侯生曰：“公子勉之矣！老臣不能从。”
侯赢说：“公子努力吧！我年老了，不能跟随你了。”
“Farewell then, my lord,” said Hou Ying. “I am too old to follow you.”

公子行数里，心不快，曰：“吾所以待侯生者备矣，天下莫不闻。今吾且死，而侯生曾无一言半辞送我，我岂有所失哉？”
公子走了几里，心里很不快，说：“我对待侯赢的礼遇已经足够周全，天下无人不知。如今我将要去死，而侯赢竟没有半句话送我，难道是我有什么过失吗？”
Lord Xinling rode several li with a growing sense of grievance. “The whole world knows how well I have treated Hou Ying,” he thought. “Yet now that I am going to die, he has not a word of farewell for me. Can I have offended him in some way?”

复引车还问侯生。侯生笑曰：“臣固知公子之还也。”
于是他调转车马返回，去问侯赢。侯赢笑着说：“我本来就知道公子会回来。”
He turned back with his carriage to question the old man. Hou Ying smiled and said, “I knew you would come back.”

曰：“公子喜士，名闻天下。今有难，无他端而欲赴秦军，譬若以肉投馁虎，何功之有哉？尚安事客？
侯赢接着说：“公子爱惜士人，声名传遍天下。如今遇到危难，却没有其他办法，只想到去拼死抵抗秦军，这就好比把肉丢给饿虎，有什么用处呢？既然如此，那你结交这些宾客又有何益呢？”
“You are famed far and wide for your generosity to men of worth; yet now that trouble has arisen you can think of nothing better than to throw yourself against the Qin army. This is like tossing meat to a starving tiger—what good can come of it? What use, then, has all your patronage of guests been?”

然公子遇臣厚，公子往而臣不送，以是知公子恨之复返也。”
“不过，公子待我很优厚。若公子真要去而我却不送行，我就知道你会因此心怀不满而再回来。”
“But since you have treated me so generously, when you departed and I did not see you off, I knew you would resent it and return.”

公子再拜，因问。侯生就让人退下，私下说：
公子于是再拜行礼，随即向他请教。侯赢便让周围的人退下，然后私下对他说：
Lord Xinling bowed twice and asked for his advice. Hou Ying thereupon dismissed the others and spoke to him in private.

乃屏人间语曰：“嬴闻晋鄙之兵符常在王卧内，而如姬最幸，出入王卧内，力能窃之。嬴闻如姬父为人所杀，如姬资之三年，自王以下欲求报其父仇，莫能得。如姬为公子泣，公子使客斩其仇头，敬进如姬。如姬之欲为公子死，无所辞，顾未有路耳。公子诚一开口请如姬，如姬必许诺，则得虎符夺晋鄙军，北救赵而西卻秦，此五霸之伐也。”
侯赢把人都请退了，私下说：“我听说晋鄙的兵符常放在魏王的卧室里，而如姬最受宠幸，常进出王的寝室，有能力将兵符窃取出来。我还听说如姬的父亲曾被人杀害，如姬怀恨三年，从王到下臣欲为她报仇却无人能办到。当年如姬曾为公子哭泣，公子曾遣客斩杀她仇人的首级，恭敬地献给如姬。如姬愿为公子赴死，毫无推辞，只是一直没有机会。若公子真心开口请求如姬，如姬必然答应，那么便可取到虎符，夺取晋鄙的军权，北面可以救援赵国，西面可以抵御秦国，这将是可比‘五霸’之业的一次征伐。”
Hou Ying dismissed everyone and whispered: “I have heard that Jin Bi’s military tally is usually kept in the king’s bedchamber, and Lady Ru—who is the king’s favourite—tends to come and go there and is perfectly placed to steal it. I have also heard that after Lady Ru’s father was murdered she nursed a thirst for revenge for three years and that nobody from the king downwards could avenge him. Once you once aided her—sending a retainer to cut off her enemy’s head and presenting it to her—she showed she would do anything for you. Lady Ru is ready to die for you and would not refuse any request; she has simply never had the chance. If you but ask her sincerely, she will agree. Then, having secured the tiger-tally and seizing Jin Bi’s troops, you could march north to relieve Zhao and push back Qin in the west — a campaign worthy of the five hegemons of old.”

公子從其計，請如姬。如姬果盜晉鄙兵符與公子。
公子接受了侯赢的计策，去求见如姬。如姬果然趁机盗得晋鄙的兵符交给了公子。
Acting on Hou Ying’s plan, Lord Xinling petitioned Lady Ru. She indeed stole Jin Bi’s military tally and handed it to him.

公子行，侯生曰：“将在外，主令有所不受，以便国家。公子即合符，而晋鄙不授公子兵而復請之，事必危矣。臣客屠者朱亥可与俱，此人力士。晋鄙听，大善；不听，可使擊之。”
公子要出发时，侯赢对他说：“在军中将领有时可以不受主上的命令，以保国家大局。眼下虽然你已合得兵符，但若晋鄙不肯把兵权交给你而是去请示王，事就会有危险。我这有一位门客，屠夫朱亥，是个力大勇猛的人，可以随你同行。若晋鄙听命，把兵权交出，那自然最好；若他不听，则可以令朱亥出手将其制伏。”
As Lord Xinling prepared to depart, Hou Ying warned him: “A commander in the field may lawfully refuse an order if the state’s safety requires it. Although you now possess the tally, if Jin Bi refuses to transfer command and appeals to the king the situation will be dangerous. I have a retainer, the butcher Zhu Hai, a man of great strength; let him go with you. If Jin Bi obeys, excellent; if he refuses, Zhu Hai can be used to strike him down.”

子泣。侯生曰：“公子畏死邪?何泣也?”
公子哭了。侯嬴说：“公子是害怕死吗？为何要哭呢？”
Lord Xinling was moved to tears. “Why are you weeping?” asked Hou Ying. “Are you afraid of death?”

公子曰：“晋鄙嚄唶宿将，往恐不听，必当杀之，是以泣耳，岂畏死哉!”
公子说：“晋鄙是个声望显赫的老将，我去时恐怕他不会听命，我必定要杀了他，因此而哭罢了，哪里是怕死呢！”
“Jin Bi is a veteran commander and completely fearless,” Lord Xinling replied. “He is not likely to obey me, and I may have to kill him. That is why I shed tears, not because I am afraid of death.”

于是公子请朱亥。朱亥笑曰：“臣乃市井鼓刀屠者，而公子亲数存之，所以不报谢者，以为小礼无所用。今公子有急，此乃臣效命之秋也。”遂与公子俱。
于是公子去请朱亥。朱亥笑着说：“我只是一个在市井卖肉的屠夫，而公子却亲自多次来问候我。我所以没有回礼答谢，是觉得小礼节没有什么用处。如今公子有急难，这正是我为您效命的时候。”于是就跟随公子一起上路。
When he asked Zhu Hai to accompany him the butcher laughed and said, “I am a butcher who chops up meat in the market, yet you have called on me time and again. I did not show my gratitude before because such small courtesies are meaningless; but now that you have need of me, my life is at your disposal.” So he accompanied Lord Xinling.

公子过谢侯生。侯生曰：“臣宜从，老不能。请数公子行日，以至晋鄙军之日，北乡自刭，以送公子。”公子遂行。
公子途中过去向侯嬴道谢。侯嬴说：“我理当随您一同前去，只是年老力衰不行了。请让我推算公子的行期，等您抵达晋鄙军营之日，我就面向北方自刎，以此来为公子送行。”公子于是继续上路。
Lord Xinling left the city by the Yi Gate in order to thank Hou Ying. “I would go with you were I not so old,” said Hou Ying. “As it is, I shall estimate the time it will take you to reach Jin Bi, and that day I will face north and kill myself to prove my loyalty.” Lord Xinling then set out.

至邺，矫魏王令代晋鄙。晋鄙合符，疑之，举手视公子曰：“今吾拥十万之众，屯于境上，国之重任，今单车来代之，何如哉?”欲无听。
公子到达邺城，假托魏王命令去接替晋鄙。晋鄙对合符后心存怀疑，举手看着公子说：“如今我统率十万大军，屯驻在国境，这是国家的重任。您现在只单车前来就要接替我，这是什么道理？”于是想要不听从命令。
Lord Xinling, reaching Ye, claimed that he had orders from the king to take over Jin Bi’s command. But although the two halves of the tally fitted each other, Jin Bi had certain misgivings and, raising a protesting hand, he looked hard at Lord Xinling. “As commander of a hundred thousand men at the frontier, I have a great responsibility to the state,” he said. “How is it you have arrived in a single chariot to replace me?” He was about to refuse.

朱亥袖四十斤铁椎，椎杀晋鄙，公子遂将晋鄙军。
朱亥从袖中取出四十斤重的铁椎，一击打死了晋鄙，公子于是接管了晋鄙的军队。
Zhu Hai killed him with a forty-pound iron pestle which he had hidden under his coat. Then Lord Xinling took over the command.

勒兵下令军中曰：“父子俱在军中，父归；兄弟俱在军中，兄归；
他整顿军队，下令全军说：“父子都在军中的，父亲回去；兄弟都在军中的，兄长回去；
He assembled the troops and announced to them: “If father and son are both serving here, the father may go home. If there are brothers, the elder may go home.

“独子无兄弟，归养。”得选兵八万人，进兵击秦军。秦军解去，遂救邯郸，存赵。赵王及平原君自迎公子于界，平原君负鞠矢为公子先引。赵王再拜曰：“自古贤人未有及公子者也。”当此之时，平原君不敢自比于人。公子与侯生决，至军，侯生果北乡自刭。魏王怒公子之盗其兵符，矫杀晋鄙，公子亦自知也。已却秦存赵，使将将其军归魏，而公子独与客留赵。赵孝成王德公子之矫夺晋鄙兵而存赵，乃与平原君计，以五城封公子。公子闻之，意骄矜而有自功之色。客有说公子曰：“物有不可忘，或有不可不忘。夫人有德于公子，公子不可忘也；公子有德于人，愿公子忘之也。且矫魏王令，夺晋鄙兵以救赵，于赵则有功矣，于魏则未为忠臣也。”
“若是独子无兄弟的，就回去奉养父母。”于是挑选出了八万精兵，进兵攻打秦军。秦军于是解围撤退，邯郸得救，赵国得以保存。赵王和平原君亲自到国境迎接公子，平原君背着箭袋，为公子作向导。赵王再拜说道：“自古以来贤人没有能比得上公子的。”在这个时候，平原君也不敢把自己与别人相比。公子与侯赢诀别，到了军中，侯赢果然向北而自刎。魏王因公子盗取兵符，假传命令杀了晋鄙而愤怒，公子自己也明白这一点。击退秦军、保住赵国之后，他让将军带领军队回魏，而自己只与宾客留在赵国。赵孝成王感念公子假传魏王命令、夺晋鄙之兵而保存赵国，便同平原君商议，以五座城邑封赏公子。公子听说之后，心中骄傲起来，显露出自矜自功的神色。有一位门客劝告公子说：“有些事不可忘记，有些事却不可不忘记。别人有恩德于公子，公子不可忘；而公子有恩德于别人，则希望公子能忘掉。况且假传魏王命令，夺取晋鄙军队以救赵国，这对赵国确实是功劳，但对于魏国来说，却不能算是忠臣啊。”
“If any soldier is an only son without brothers, let him return home to care for his parents.” Then with eighty thousand picked troops he advanced against the Qin army. The Qin forces withdrew, the siege of Handan was lifted, and Zhao was preserved. The king of Zhao and Lord Pingyuan came in person to the frontier to welcome Lord Xinling. Lord Pingyuan carried his quiver and went ahead as his guide. The king of Zhao bowed twice and said, “Since ancient times no worthy man has equaled you, my lord.” At this time, Lord Pingyuan dared not compare himself with others. Lord Xinling took leave of Hou Ying, and when he reached the army, Hou Ying, as promised, faced north and killed himself. The king of Wei grew angry that Lord Xinling had stolen his tally and falsely issued orders to kill Jin Bi; and Lord Xinling himself was aware of this. After repelling the Qin and saving Zhao, he ordered a general to lead the troops back to Wei, while he remained in Zhao with his followers. King Xiaocheng of Zhao, grateful that Lord Xinling had feigned orders from the king of Wei and seized Jin Bi’s troops to save Zhao, discussed the matter with Lord Pingyuan and resolved to reward him with five cities. When Lord Xinling heard of this, he grew proud and displayed a self-satisfied air of achievement.One of his retainers admonished him, saying: “There are things which must not be forgotten, and there are things which must not be remembered. If others have shown kindness to you, you must never forget; but if you have done kindness to others, it is best to forget it. Moreover, by feigning the king of Wei’s command to seize Jin Bi’s army and save Zhao, you rendered service to Zhao, but to Wei you were not a loyal minister.”

公子乃自骄而功之，窃为公子不取也。”于是公子立自责，似若无所容者。赵王埽除自迎，执主人之礼，引公子就西阶。公子侧行辞让，从东阶上。自言罪过，以负于魏，无功于赵。赵王侍酒至暮，口不忍献五城，以公子退让也。公子竟留赵。赵王以部为公子汤沐邑，魏亦复以信陵奉公子。公子留赵。公子闻赵有处士毛公藏于博徒，薛公藏于卖浆家，公子欲见两人，两人自匿不肯见公子。公子闻所在，乃闲步往从此两人游，甚欢。平原君闻之，谓其夫人曰：“始吾闻夫人弟公子天下无双，今吾闻之，乃妄从博徒卖浆者游，公子妄人耳。”夫人以告公子。公子乃谢夫人去，曰：“始吾闻平原君贤，故负魏王而救赵，今乃妄人耳。”
公子因此生出骄傲，自以为有功，我私下认为公子不该这样。”于是公子立刻责备自己，好像无地自容一般。赵王亲自扫除台阶迎接，用主人的礼节，引导公子从西阶上殿。公子却侧身谦让，从东阶而上，并自称有罪，有负于魏国，对赵国没有功劳。赵王陪着饮酒直到傍晚，因为公子谦逊退让，不忍心再提献五城的事。公子于是留在赵国。赵王以部邑作为公子的封邑，魏国也重新以信陵邑奉养公子。公子就留居赵国。公子听说赵国有隐士，毛公藏身在赌博的人群里，薛公则藏身在卖酒之家。公子想要拜会这两人，但他们躲避，不愿见公子。公子得知他们的住处后，便悄悄前往，与两人交游，非常高兴。平原君听闻此事，对夫人说：“起初我听说夫人的弟弟魏公子是天下无双的贤人，如今却听说他随意和赌徒、卖酒之人交游，原来是个荒唐人啊。”夫人把这话告诉了公子。公子于是谢别夫人，说：“当初我听说平原君贤能，所以冒犯魏王去救赵国，如今看来他不过是个荒唐人罢了。”
“Loyal to Wei, this is not an achievement of which you should be proud,” said his retainer. Lord Xinling at once admitted his fault, feeling as if he had no place to stand. The king of Zhao swept the steps himself to welcome him and, treating him with the rites of a host, led him to ascend by the west steps. But Lord Xinling declined, going up by the east steps instead, declaring that he was guilty toward Wei and had done little for Zhao. The king of Zhao entertained him with wine until evening, but out of respect for his humility refrained from offering the five cities. Lord Xinling remained in Zhao. The king of Zhao granted him the district of Bu as a fief, and Wei also again maintained him at Xinling. Thus Lord Xinling stayed on in Zhao. During his stay he heard of two recluses: one, Master Mao, who hid among gamblers; the other, Master Xue, who concealed himself among sellers of gruel. Lord Xinling wished to meet them, but they hid themselves and refused to see him. Learning their whereabouts, he went quietly to visit them and took great pleasure in their company. When Lord Pingyuan heard of this, he said to his wife: “At first I heard that your brother was a man of unmatched excellence, but now I hear that he idly associates with gamblers and sellers of gruel. He must be a foolish man after all.” When his wife reported this to Lord Xinling, he thanked her and prepared to leave, saying: “At first I heard that Lord Pingyuan was virtuous, so I wronged the king of Wei in order to rescue Zhao. Now it seems he is but a foolish man himself.”

“故负魏王而救赵，以称平原君。平原君之游，徒豪举耳，不求士也。无忌自在大梁时，尝闻此两人贤，至赵，恐不得见。以无忌从之游，尚恐其不我欲也，今平原君乃以为羞。其不足从游!”乃装为去。夫人具以语平原君。平原君乃免冠谢，固留公子。平原君门下闻之，半去平原君归公子。天下士复往归公子，公子倾平原君客。公子留赵十年不归。秦闻公子在赵，日夜出兵东伐魏。魏王患之，使使往请公子。公子恐其怒之，乃诫门下：“有敢为魏王使通者，死。”宾客皆背魏之赵，莫敢劝公子归。毛公、薛公两人往见公子曰：“公子所以重于赵，名闻诸侯者，徒以有魏也。今秦攻魏，魏急，而公子不恤之，恐大名之不全也。”
“所以我背弃魏王来救赵，只是为了不负平原君。平原君与人交游，不过是为了显示自己的豪爽罢了，并不是为了招贤纳士。我在大梁的时候，早就听说过这两人贤能，到了赵国，还怕见不到他们；就算和他们交游，也怕他们不愿意接纳我。现在平原君竟然以此为耻，那他就不值得我交游！”于是收拾行装准备离去。夫人把这些话都转告平原君。平原君便脱下帽子谢罪，竭力挽留公子。平原君门下的宾客听说此事，有一半离开了平原君，归附公子。天下的贤士又纷纷投奔公子，公子的门客人数超过了平原君。公子在赵国居住了十年没有回魏。秦国听说公子在赵，就日夜出兵东进攻打魏国。魏王因此忧虑，派使者前来请公子回去。公子害怕魏王生气，便告诫门下说：“谁敢替魏王的使臣传话，处死！”宾客们原本就是背弃魏国投奔赵国的，没有人敢劝公子回去。毛公、薛公两人前来见公子，说：“公子之所以在赵国受到尊敬，名声传遍诸侯，只是因为有魏国的缘故。如今秦国攻打魏国，魏国危急，而公子却不体恤，这恐怕会损害您的大名啊。”
“I wronged the king of Wei in order to rescue Zhao, all for the sake of Lord Pingyuan. But Lord Pingyuan’s gatherings are nothing more than displays of extravagance; he does not truly seek out worthy men. While still in Daliang I heard of the excellence of these two gentlemen, and after arriving in Zhao I feared I might never meet them. Even if I joined their company, I worried they might not accept me. Yet now Lord Pingyuan calls this a disgrace. His company is hardly worth keeping!” He began packing to leave. When his sister repeated this to Lord Pingyuan, he removed his cap in apology and begged Lord Xinling to stay. On hearing of this, half of Lord Pingyuan’s retainers abandoned him to join Lord Xinling. Scholars from all over again flocked to him, and soon his followers far outnumbered those of Lord Pingyuan. Lord Xinling remained in Zhao for ten years without returning home. When Qin heard he was in Zhao, it sent expeditions day and night to attack Wei. The king of Wei was deeply troubled and dispatched envoys to summon Lord Xinling back. But fearing the king’s anger, Lord Xinling warned his followers: “Any man who dares to pass on a message from the king of Wei shall die.” Since his retainers had all forsaken Wei to follow him to Zhao, no one dared urge his return. At last, Masters Mao and Xue went to see him. They said: “The reason you are honored in Zhao, and your fame is known among the feudal lords, is solely because of Wei. Now that Qin is attacking Wei and Wei is in peril, if you fail to show concern, we fear your great reputation will not endure.”

使秦破大梁而夷先王之宗庙，公子当何面目立天下乎?”语未及卒，公子立变色，告车趣驾归救魏。
假使秦国攻破大梁而夷平了先王的宗庙，公子有什么脸面立于天下呢？”话还没有说完，公子马上变了脸色，吩咐车夫赶快驱车回救魏国。
“Qin is attacking Wei, yet you appear quite unmoved by your country's danger. Suppose Qin takes Daliang by storm and razes your ancestral temples—how will you be able to face the world again?” Before they had finished speaking, Lord Xinling turned pale. Calling for his carriage, he raced back to the aid of his country.

魏王见公子，相与泣，而以上将军印授公子，公子遂将。魏安釐王三十年，公子使使遍告诸侯。诸侯闻公子将，各遣将将兵救魏。
魏王会见了公子，相对哭泣，把上将军印授给了公子，于是公子就任统帅。魏安釐王三十年（公元前277年），公子派使臣遍告各诸侯国。诸侯听说公子领兵，各自派遣大将率兵救援魏国。
At his meeting with the king of Wei they both wept, and he was appointed as high marshal. In the thirtieth year of King An Xi, Lord Xinling sent envoys to all the states, and when they knew that he was Wei’s commander-in-chief they dispatched troops to his aid.

公子率五国之兵破秦军于河外，走蒙骜。遂乘胜逐秦军至函谷关，抑秦兵，秦兵不敢出。当是时，公子威振天下，诸侯之客进兵法，公子皆名之，故世俗称《魏公子兵法》。
公子率领五国军队在黄河以南打败了秦军，赶走了蒙骜。然后乘胜追击，把秦军赶到函谷关，压制秦军，使秦兵不敢再出战。此时，公子威震天下，来自各国的门客进献兵法，公子都题名收录，因此世人称之为《魏公子兵法》。
Then at the head of the troops from five states he routed Qin’s army south of the Yellow River, put General Meng Ao to flight and drove the enemy into the Hangu Pass, striking such fear into the men of Qin that they dared not sally forth again. His military prowess shook the world, and wise men from various states sent him stratagems which he compiled in one volume under his name. This collection is generally known as Lord Xinling on the Art of War.

秦王患之，乃行金万斤于魏，求晋鄙客，令毁公子于魏王曰：“公子亡在外十年矣，今为魏将，诸侯将皆属，诸侯徒闻魏公子，不闻魏王。公子亦欲因此时定南面而王，诸侯畏公子之威，
秦王担心此事，就用一万斤黄金到魏国行贿，收买晋鄙的门客，让他们在魏王面前诋毁公子，说：“公子逃亡在外十年了，现在是魏国的上将，诸侯的将领都归附于他。诸侯只听说魏公子，不知道魏王。公子也想乘此时平定天下而称王，诸侯畏惧公子的威势，
In great alarm, the king of Qin bribed a former follower of Jin Bi with ten thousand catties of gold to slander Lord Xinling before the king of Wei. “Lord Xinling has been away for ten years,” this man said, “yet now he commands not only our troops but the forces of other states. The feudal lords have heard of Lord Xinling but not of the king of Wei. If he aspires to seize the throne, the other states, fearing his might, will support him.”

方欲共立之。”秦数使反间，伪贺公子得立为魏王未也。魏王日闻其毁，不能不信，后果使人代公子将。
正打算共同拥立他。”秦国多次施用反间计，假装祝贺公子，询问他是否已经登上魏王之位。魏王每天听到这些毁谤，不能不信，后来果然派别人代替公子领兵。
They were even ready to set him up as ruler. Qin repeatedly sent agents with false congratulations, pretending to ask whether Lord Xinling had yet assumed the throne of Wei. Hearing such slanders every day, the king of Wei could not help but believe them, and in the end he appointed another general to take over command.

公子自知再以毁废，乃谢病不朝，与宾客为长夜饮，饮醇酒，多近妇女。日夜为乐饮者四岁，竟病酒而卒。其岁，魏安釐王亦薨。
公子知道自己再次因毁谤被废，就托病不再上朝，和宾客通宵达旦地饮烈酒作乐，并且过分亲近妇女。这样日夜纵情饮酒四年，最终因酒病而去世。这一年，魏安釐王也去世了。
Lord Xinling, realizing that slander had twice led to his removal, feigned illness and ceased to attend court. He spent his nights drinking strong wine with friends and indulging in women. After four years of such carousing, he fell ill from drink and died. King An Xi of Wei also passed away in the same year.

秦闻公子死，使蒙骜攻魏，拔二十城，初置东郡。其后秦稍蚕食魏，十八岁而虏魏王，屠大梁。
秦国听说公子死了，就派蒙骜攻打魏国，攻下二十座城池，首次设立东郡。此后秦逐渐蚕食魏国，十八年后俘虏魏王，屠灭大梁。
When Qin heard of Lord Xinling’s death, it sent Meng Ao to attack Wei, capturing twenty cities and establishing Qin’s Eastern Province. Thereafter Qin gradually encroached upon Wei, and eighteen years later it seized the king of Wei and massacred the inhabitants of Daliang.

高祖始微少时，数闻公子贤。及即天子位，每过大梁，常祠公子。高祖十二年，从击黥布还，为公子置守冢五家，世世岁以四时奉祠公子。
汉高祖年轻贫贱时，就常常听说公子的贤名。等到登上天子之位后，每次经过大梁，常常祭祀公子。高祖十二年（公元前195年），从征讨黥布回来，为公子安排了五户人家守护其坟墓，世世代代每年四季都要祭祀公子。
During his youth, our first emperor (Gaozu of Han) often heard of Lord Xinling’s virtue. After ascending the throne, whenever he passed through Daliang he made sacrifices at Lord Xinling’s shrine. In the twelfth year of his reign, returning from a campaign against Ying Bu, he appointed five families to guard Lord Xinling’s tomb, with the duty of offering sacrifices to him in every season of the year for all generations.

太史公曰：吾过大梁之墟，求问其所谓夷门。夷门者，城之东门也。天下诸公子亦有喜士者矣，然信陵君之接岩穴隐者，不耻下交，有以也。名冠诸侯，不虚耳。高祖每过之而令民奉祠不绝也。
太史公说：我路过大梁城的废墟，向当地人请教他们所说的夷门。夷门，就是大梁城的东门。天下的诸公子也有喜欢结交士人的，但信陵君连山间隐士都去结交，从不以与地位卑下的人交游为耻，这是有道理的。所以他的名望能够冠绝诸侯，并不是虚名。汉高祖每次路过这里，都命令百姓祭祀他，从未间断。
The Grand Historian says: “When I passed through the ruins of Daliang, I asked about the so-called Yi Gate and was told it was the city’s eastern gate. Many noble lords also delighted in gathering retainers, but Lord Xinling even sought out recluses hidden in caves and felt no shame in befriending men of low station. For this reason his renown outshone that of all the feudal princes, and it was no empty reputation. Whenever Emperor Gaozu passed that place, he ordered the people to continue the sacrifices without cease.”
