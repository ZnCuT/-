其后二百二十余年秦有荆轲之事。
这件事过了二百二十多年，秦国又出了一个荆轲。
Some 220 years later there was the affair of Jing Ke in Qin.

荆轲者，卫人也。其先乃齐人，徙于卫，卫人谓之庆卿。而之燕，燕人谓之荆卿。
荆轲是卫国人。他的先辈本是齐国人，后来荆轲搬到了卫国，卫国人叫他 “庆卿”; 后来荆轲到了燕国，燕国人又叫他 “荆卿”。
Jing Ke was a native of Wey, though his family came originally from Qi. The men of Wey referred to him as Master Qing, the men of Yan, as Master Jing.

荆卿好读书击剑，以术说卫元君，卫元君不用。其后秦伐魏，置东郡，徙卫元君之支属于野王。
荆卿喜欢读书和击剑，曾以治国之术劝说过卫元君，卫元君没有采用。后来秦国东攻魏国，在新占领的地区设立了东郡，接着又占领了朝歌，把魏国的附庸君主卫元君和他的支属迁到了野王。
He loved to read books and practise swordsmanship. He expounded his ideas to Lord Yuan of Wey, but Lord Yuan failed to make use of him. Later, Qin attacked Wey, established Dong Province, and moved the collateral kinsmen of Lord Yuan of Wey to Yewang.

荆轲尝游过榆次，与盖聂论剑，盖聂怒而目之。荆轲出，人或言复召荆卿。盖聂曰：“曩者吾与论剑有不称者，吾目之；试往，是宜去，不敢留。” 使使往之主人，荆卿则已驾而去榆次矣。使者还报，盖聂曰：“固去也，吾曩者目摄之！”
这时离乡漂流的荆轲先是到了赵国的榆次，在榆次他和盖聂谈论过剑术。因为荆轲的剑术有毛病，被盖聂瞪了一眼，荆轲没说话就出门走了。有人问盖聂是不是去把荆轲再找回来。盖聂说：“刚才我和他比试剑术，有些地方他做得不对，我瞪了他一眼。你去看看吧，我估计他可能离开榆次了，他不会留在这里。” 结果派人去到荆轲居住的房东那里一问，荆轲果然已经赶着车子离开了榆次。派去的人回来向盖聂一说，盖聂说：“本来我就估计他已经走了，因为我刚才瞪了他一眼。”
Jing Ke once visited the area of Yuci, where he engaged Gai Nie in a discussion on swordsmanship. In the course of the talk, Gai Nie got angry and glared fiercely at Jing Ke, who immediately withdrew. Someone asked Gai Nie if he did not intend to summon Jing Ke back again. “When I was discussing swordsmanship with him a little while ago,” said Gai Nie, “we had a difference of opinion and I glared at him. Go and look for him if you like, but I’m quite certain he has gone. He wouldn’t dare stay around!” Gai Nie sent a messenger to the house where Jing Ke had been staying, but Jing Ke had already mounted his carriage and left Yuci. When the messenger returned with this report, Gai Nie said, “I knew he would go. I glared at him and frightened him away.”

荆轲游于邯郸，鲁句践与荆轲博，争道，鲁句践怒而叱之，荆轲默而逃去，遂不复会。
接着荆轲又到了邯郸，在邯郸时他曾经和鲁句践一起下棋，因为两个人争执该当谁走，鲁句践对荆轲生气地呵斥了一声，荆轲又是什么话也没说悄悄地走了，两个人从此再没有见面。
Again, when Jing Ke was visiting the city of Handan, he and a man named Lu Goujian got into a quarrel over a chess game. Lu Goujian grew angry and began to shout, whereupon Jing Ke fled without a word and never came to see Lu Goujian again.

荆轲既至燕，爱燕之狗屠及善击筑者高渐离。荆轲嗜酒，日与狗屠及高渐离饮于燕市，酒酣以往，高渐离击筑，荆轲和而歌于市中，相乐也，已而相泣，旁若无人者。荆轲虽游于酒人乎，然其为人沈深好书；其所游诸侯，尽与其贤豪长者相结。其之燕，燕之处士田光先生亦善待之，知其非庸人也。
荆轲来到燕国后，和燕国一个杀狗的屠户与一位擅长击筑的高渐离感情很好。荆轲喜欢饮酒，天天和那个屠户与高渐离在燕国的市场上痛饮。等到喝得劲头上来，高渐离就击筑为声，荆轲就和着筑声引吭高唱，两人以此为乐。待至唱了一会儿，忽然又转为相对落泪，简直就像周围没有别人一样。荆轲虽然是好跟那班酒徒混在一起，但他的为人却深沉稳重，而且喜欢念书，他不论到了哪个国家，总是跟那些有威望有才干的人物交朋友。他到了燕国后，燕国的在野名人田光也对他很好，知道他不是平庸之辈。
In the course of his travels Jing Ke reached the state of Yan, where he became close friends with a dog butcher and a man named Gao Jianli who was good at playing the lute. Jing Ke was fond of wine, and every day he would join the dog butcher and Gao Jianli to drink in the market place of the Yan capital. After the wine had begun to take effect, Gao Jianli would strike up the lute and Jing Ke would join in with a song. In the middle of the crowded market place they would happily amuse themselves, or if their mood changed they would break into tears, exactly as though there were no one else about. But, although Jing Ke spent his time with drunkards, he was a man of depth and learning. Whatever feudal state he travelled to, he always became close friends with the most worthy and influential men. When he went to Yan, Master Tian Guang, a gentleman of Yan who was living in retirement, treated him very kindly, for he realized that he was no ordinary man.

居顷之，会燕太子丹质秦亡归燕。燕太子丹者，故尝质于赵，而秦王政生于赵，其少时与丹欢。及政立为秦王，而丹质于秦。秦王之遇燕太子丹不善，故丹怨而亡归。归而求为报秦王者，国小，力不能。其后秦日出兵山东以伐齐、楚、三晋，稍蚕食诸侯，且至于燕，燕君臣皆恐祸之至。太子丹患之，问其傅鞠武。武对曰：“秦地遍天下，威胁韩、魏、赵氏，北有甘泉、谷口之固，南有泾、渭之沃，擅巴、汉之饶，右陇、蜀之山，左关、殽之险，民众而士厉，兵革有余。意有所出，则长城之南，易水以北，未有所定也。奈何以见陵之怨，欲批其逆鳞哉！” 丹曰：“然则何由？” 对曰：“请入图之。”
没过多久，在秦国当人质的太子丹从秦国逃回来了。太子丹原来曾在赵国当人质，当时秦王政出生在赵国，小时候和太子丹很要好。等到他回国当了秦王之后，太子丹又到秦国来当人质了，这时秦王政对待太子丹很不好，于是太子丹恨恨地逃了回来。回国后太子丹就想寻找机会向秦王报仇，但由于燕国弱小，自己没有力量。后来秦国又接连不断地出兵东下，攻打齐国、楚国和韩、赵、魏三国，逐渐地向东蚕食各国的领土，眼看着就要打到燕国的头上来了，燕国的君臣们都很害怕这种灾难的来临。太子丹很担心，向他的老师鞠武请教。鞠武说：“秦国的土地遍天下，威胁着韩国、魏国和赵国。秦国北有甘泉、谷口的坚固要塞，南有泾水、渭水灌溉的肥沃土壤，并拥有巴郡、汉中的富饶资源，西有陇山、岷山，东有函谷关、崤山，他们人多兵强，武器充裕。只要他们的心眼对我们一动，那么这长城以南、易水以北的燕国就无法安生了。您何必为受了一点欺侮去触犯他们呢？” 太子丹说：“那我们有什么办法吗？” 鞠武说：“让我再好好地考虑考虑。”
After Jing Ke had been in Yan some time, Prince Dan, the heir apparent of Yan, who had been a hostage in Qin, escaped and returned home. Previously Prince Dan had been a hostage in Zhao. Zheng, the king of Qin, was born in Zhao, and in his youth had been very friendly with Prince Dan; later, when Zheng became king, Prince Dan went as a hostage to the Qin court. But the king of Qin treated him very shabbily until, in anger, he escaped from the state and returned to Yan. After his return, he looked about for someone who would undertake to get back at the king of Qin for him; but because Yan was small and powerless, there was nothing he could do. Meanwhile, Qin day by day dispatched more troops east of the mountains, attacking Qi, Chu, Hann, Wei, and Zhao and gradually eating away at the lands of the other feudal lords, until it became obvious that Yan’s turn would be next. The ruler of Yan and his ministers all feared imminent disaster, and Prince Dan, likewise worried over the situation, asked his tutor Ju Wu what could be done. Ju Wu replied, “Qin’s lands fill the world and its might overawes the rulers of Hann, Wei, and Zhao. To the north it occupies the strongholds at Sweet Springs and Valley Mouth, and to the south the fertile fields of the Jing and Wei river valleys; it commands the riches of Ba and Han and the mountain ranges of Long and Shu to the west, and the vital Hangu and Yao passes to the east. Its people are numerous and its soldiers well trained, and it has more weapons and armour than it can use. If it should ever decide to march against us, we could find no safety south of the Great Wall or north of the Yi River. Angry as you are at the insults you have suffered, you surely would not want to brush against its bristling scales!”“Then what should I do?” said Prince Dan.“Let me retire and think it over,” replied Ju Wu.

居有间，秦将樊於期得罪于秦王，亡之燕，太子受而舍之。鞠武谏曰：“不可。夫以秦王之暴而积怒于燕，足为寒心，又况闻樊将军之所在乎？是谓‘委肉当饿虎之蹊’也，祸必不振矣！虽有管、晏，不能为之谋也。愿太子疾遣樊将军入匈奴以灭口。请西约三晋，南连齐、楚，北购于单于，其后乃可图也。” 太子曰：“太傅之计，旷日弥久，心昏然，恐不能须臾。且非独于此也，夫樊将军穷困于天下，归身于丹，丹终不以迫于强秦而弃所哀怜之交，置之匈奴，是固丹命卒之时也。愿太傅更虑之。” 鞠武曰：“夫行危欲求安，造祸而求福，计浅而怨深，连结一人之后交，不顾国家之大害，此所谓‘资怨而助祸’矣 "。夫以鸿毛燎于炉炭之上，必无事矣。且以雕鸷之秦，行怨暴之怒，岂足道哉！燕有田光先生，其为人智深而勇沉，可与谋。” 太子曰：“愿因太傅而得交于田先生，可乎？” 鞠武曰：“敬诺。” 出见田光先生，道 “太子愿图国事于先生也”。田光曰：“敬奉教。” 乃造焉。
又过了一段时间，秦国的将领樊於期因为得罪秦王逃到了燕国，太子丹收留他，让他住了下来。鞠武劝阻说：“不能留他。凭着秦王的残暴和他素日对我们燕国的怒气，就已经够让人胆战心寒的了，何况再让他知道樊将军又到了我们这里呢？这就叫做‘把肉往饿虎经过的道上扔’, 灾难必然是没救了！到那时即使有管仲、晏婴那样的谋臣也不可能再替您拿出主意。希望您赶紧打发樊将军去匈奴，以消除秦国进攻我们的借口，然后我们向西联合韩、赵、魏三国，向南联合齐国、楚国，再向北联合匈奴人，只有这样，我们才可能考虑如何与秦国作战的问题。” 太子丹说：“照您的计划，将不知拖到何年何月，现在我的心里昏昏然，恐怕等不了多久了。再说樊将军是在走投无路的情况下来投奔我的，我无论如何不能因为惧怕秦国而抛弃一位可怜的朋友，把他扔到匈奴去。也许现在已经到了我该死的时候了，希望您替我想想别的办法。” 鞠武说：“一边在故意冒险一边又求太平，一边在制造祸端一边又求福分，不作深谋远虑却又不断地激怒敌人，为了一个新来的朋友，竟然不顾国家的大害，这就是俗话所说的‘自己在加快灾难的降临’。这就如同把鸡毛放在炉火上烧，肯定是一下子就完了。那么一个像雕鸷一样凶猛的秦国，来对我们发泄他那积蓄已久的怒气，那还用得着说什么吗？我们国家有位田光先生，这个人有深智大勇，您可以找他商量商量。” 太子丹说：“我希望通过你的引见认识田先生，你看行吗？” 鞠武说：“可以。” 于是鞠武出去找到田光说：“太子希望见你和你商量商量国家大事。” 田光说：“遵命。” 于是他就到太子那里去了。
Shortly afterwards the Qin general Fan Yuqi, having offended the king of Qin, fled to Yan, where Prince Dan received him and assigned him quarters. Ju Wu admonished the prince, saying, “This will not do! Violent as the king of Qin is, and with the resentment he nurses against Yan because of your escape, it is already enough to make one’s heart turn cold. And what will he be like when he hears where General Fan is staying? This is what men call throwing meat in the path of a starving tiger — there will be no help for the misfortune that follows! Even if you had ministers as wise as Guan Zhong and Yan Ying, they could think of no way to save you! I beg you to send General Fan at once to the territory of the Xiongnu barbarians to get him out of the way. Then, after you have negotiated with Hann, Wei, and Zhao to the west, entered into alliance with Qi and Chu on the south, and established friendly relations with the leader of the Xiongnu to the north, we may be able to plan what move to make next.”“The scheme you propose will require a great deal of time,” said Prince Dan. “As anxious as I feel at the moment, I am afraid I cannot wait that long! And that is not all. General Fan, having been hounded throughout the world, has come to entrust his fate to me. No matter how much I might be pressed by Qin and its power, I could never bear, when he is in such a pitiful plight, to betray his friendship and abandon him by sending him off to the Xiongnu! This is a matter of life and death to me. I beg you to consider the question once more.”Ju Wu said, “To pursue a dangerous course and hope for safety, to invite disaster while seeking good fortune; with too little planning and too much hatred to disregard a serious threat to the whole nation because of some lately incurred debt of friendship to one man — this is what is known as ‘fanning resentment and abetting disaster’! Drop a swan’s feather into a burning brazier and puff! — it is all over in an instant. And when Qin, like a ravening hawk, comes to vent its anger, will Yan be able to last any longer? However, there is a certain Master Tian Guang in Yan who is a man of deep wisdom and great daring. He would be a good person to consult.”“I would like you to introduce me to him,” said Prince Dan. “Can you arrange it?”“With pleasure,” said Ju Wu, and went to see Master Tian, informing him that the crown prince wished to consult him on matters of state. “I will be happy to comply,” said Master Tian. He went to call on the prince, who came out to greet him, politely led him inside, knelt, and dusted off a mat for him to sit on.

太子逢迎，却行为导，跪而蔽席。田光坐定，左右无人，太子避席而请曰：“燕、秦不两立，愿先生留意也。” 田光曰：“臣闻骐骥盛壮之时，一日而驰千里；至其衰老，驽马先之。今太子闻光盛壮之时，不知臣精已消亡矣。虽然，光不敢以图国事，所善荆卿可使也。” 太子曰：“愿因先生得结交于荆卿，可乎？” 田光曰：“敬诺。” 即起，趋出。太子送至门，戒曰：“丹所报，先生所言者，国之大事也，愿先生勿泄也！” 田光俛而笑曰：“诺。” 偻行见荆卿，曰：“光与子相善，燕国莫不知。今太子闻光壮盛之时，不知吾形已不逮也，幸而教之曰‘燕、秦不两立，愿先生留意也’。光窃不自外，言足下于太子也，愿足下过太子于宫。” 荆轲曰：“谨奉教。” 田光曰：“吾闻之，长者为行，不使人疑之。今太子告光曰‘所言者，国之大事也，愿先生勿泄’，是太子疑光也。夫为行而使人疑之，非节侠也。” 欲自杀以激荆卿，曰：“愿足下急过太子，言光已死，明不言也。” 因遂自刎而死。
太子丹亲自迎到了门外，而后在前面倒退着为田光引路，进屋后又跪下去用袖子为田光掸了掸坐席。待至田光坐定，左右的人们退出后，太子丹又离开坐席，尊敬地向田光请教说：“燕国和秦国是势不两立的，请先生关心我们当前的形势。” 田光说：“一匹骏马在它健壮的时候，一天能跑一千里，可是到它老了的时候，连一匹劣马也能跑到它的前头。太子您听说我能干，那是我年轻时候的事，却不知我现在的精力已经不行了。但尽管我现在已经不能再和您一道筹划大事，而我的朋友荆卿却可以给您派用场。” 太子丹说：“我想通过您的介绍认识荆卿，您看行吗？” 田光说：“遵命。” 说完起身出门。太子丹送到了门口，嘱咐田光说：“刚才我对您说的话，以及您所说的事情，可都是国家大事，希望您不要泄露。” 田光低头笑道：“当然。” 田光立刻弯着腰去找到了荆卿，说：“咱们两个人的关系好，燕国无人不知。可是太子光知道我年轻时的本事，而不知道我现在的身体已经不顶用了。他对我说：‘燕国和秦国是势不两立的，希望您关心我们现在的局势。’当时我不见外，就把你推荐给太子了。希望你迅速到他宫里见他。” 荆轲说：“愿意遵命。” 田光又说：“俗话说：‘一个有德性的人办事，不应该让别人怀疑。’刚才太子曾嘱咐我说：‘我们所说的话可都是国家大事，希望您不要泄露。’这说明太子对我不放心。一个人办事如果让别人怀疑，那就不能算是好汉。” 其实他是想用自己的死来激励荆轲下决心，于是就对荆轲说：“请你赶紧到太子那里去，就说我已经死了，我是为了让他知道我没有泄露国家机密。” 说罢遂自刎而死。
When Tian Guang was settled on his seat and those about them had retired, the prince deferentially moved off his mat and addressed his request to his visitor: “Yan and Qin cannot both stand! I beg you to devote your mind to this problem.” “They say,” replied Tian Guang, “that when a thoroughbred horse is in its prime, it can gallop 1,000 li in one day; but when it is old and decrepit, the sorriest nag will outdistance it. It appears that you have heard reports of how I was when I was in my prime, but do not realize that my strength is by now wasted and gone. Nevertheless, though I myself would not venture to plan for the safety of the state, I have a friend named Master Jing who could be consulted.”“I would like you to introduce me to him,” said Prince Dan. “Is it possible?”“With pleasure,” said Tian Guang and, rising from his mat, he hurried from the room. The prince escorted him as far as the gate and there warned him, “What we have been discussing is a matter of vital concern to the nation. Please do not let word of it leak out!”Tian Guang lowered his gaze to the ground and replied with a laugh, “I understand.”Then, stooped with age, he made his way to the house of Master Jing. “Everyone in Yan knows that we are good friends,” he said. “The crown prince, having heard reports of me when I was in my prime and unaware that by now my powers have failed, has told me that Yan and Qin cannot continue to exist side by side and begged me to devote my mind to the problem. Rather than refuse his request, I took the liberty of mentioning your name. May I ask you to go call on him at his palace?”“I will be glad to comply,” said Jing Ke.“They say,” Tian Guang continued, “that a worthy man does not act in such a way as to arouse distrust in others. Now the prince has warned me that the matter we discussed is of vital concern to the nation and begged me not to let word of it leak out. Obviously he distrusts me, and if my actions have aroused his distrust, then I am no gentleman of honour!” Tian Guang had decided to commit suicide in order to spur Jing Ke to action, and he continued: “I want you to go at once and visit the prince. Tell him I am already dead, so he will know that I have not betrayed the secret!” With this he cut his throat and died.

荆轲遂见太子，言田光已死，致光之言。太子再拜而跪，膝行流涕，有顷而后言曰：“丹所以诫田先生毋言者，欲以成大事之谋也。今田先生以死明不言，岂丹之心哉！” 荆轲坐定，太子避席顿首曰：“田先生不知丹之不肖，使得至前，敢有所道，此天之所以哀燕而不弃其孤也。今秦有贪利之心，而欲不可足也。非尽天下之地，臣海内之王者，其意不厌。今秦已虏韩王，尽纳其地。又举兵南伐楚，北临赵；王翦将数十万之众距漳、邺，而李信出太原、云中。赵不能支秦，必入臣，入臣则祸至燕。燕小弱，数困于兵，今计举国不足以当秦。诸侯服秦，莫敢合从。丹之私计，愚以为诚得天下之勇士使于秦，窥以重利；秦王贪，其势必得所愿矣。诚得劫秦王，使悉反诸侯侵地，若曹沫之与齐桓公，则大善矣；则不可，因而刺杀之。彼秦大将擅兵于外而内有乱，则君臣相疑，以其间诸侯得合从，其破秦必矣。此丹之上愿，而不知所委命，唯荆卿留意焉。” 久之，荆轲曰：“此国之大事也，臣驽下，恐不足任使。” 太子前顿首，固请毋让，然后许诺。于是尊荆卿为上卿，舍上舍。太子日造门下，供太牢具，异物间进，车骑美女恣荆轲所欲，以顺适其意。
于是荆轲立即去拜见了太子，对太子说田光已经死了，并且把田光临死前说的话对太子丹说了一遍。太子丹拜了两拜，跪在地上流着眼泪，过了好一会才说出话来，他说：“我当时所以嘱咐田先生，是为了保证大事的成功。如今田先生竟然为了表明不泄露机密而自杀了，这哪里是我的本意呢！” 荆轲坐定以后，太子丹又离开坐席，对荆轲叩头说：“田先生不认为我没出息，让我能到您面前，来向您表达我的心事，这真是老天爷可怜我们燕国而不想抛弃我们啊。如今秦国贪婪得很，他们的欲望是永远不能满足的。他们不把所有的国家全部消灭，不把各国的国王都变成他的奴仆，他们是不会死心的。现在他们已经俘虏了韩王，吞并了韩国的土地；又发兵向南征伐楚国，向北逼近赵国。王翦率领着几十万人已经到达了赵国南境的漳水、邺城；而李信又从云中、太原出兵向赵国进击，赵国抵抗不住，必然要向秦国投降。赵国一投降，接着灾祸就要会降临到我们了。我们的国家弱小，又多次遭受战争的破坏。现在估计一下，即使动员起整个国家的力量也抵挡不了秦国。现在各国都怕秦国，谁也不敢再和我们联合。按我个人的想法，如果能找到一位勇士，派他到秦国去，我们可以拿重利去引诱秦王；秦王贪心大，必然能让我们找到接近他的机会。这样我们一旦劫持了他，逼他交还侵占诸侯们的土地，就像当年曹沫劫持齐桓公那样，这是最好的结果了；假如劫持不成，那就乘机把他杀掉。秦国的大将都领兵在外，国内一旦出现动乱，他们君臣间必然会出现猜疑，乘他们疑乱的机会，我们东方各国就可以联合起来，就肯定可以打败秦国了。这是我最高的愿望，只是不知道该把这个任务托付给谁，请您多关照！” 过了好一会儿，荆轲说：“这可是国家的大事，我本事不高，恐怕承担不起。” 太子丹进前叩头，坚决请他不要推辞，荆轲答应了。于是太子丹尊荆轲为上卿，让他住进最高级的客馆。太子丹还每天都到那里向他问候，给他送去牛、羊、猪三者全备的最高级的食品，此外还不时地给他送去各种奇珍异宝，至于其他车马、美女等等，更是敞着口地让荆轲尽情享用，总之一切都顺着他的心。
Jing Ke went to see the prince and informed him of Tian Guang’s death and last words. The prince bowed twice and then, sinking to his knees, crawled forward, the tears starting from his eyes. After some time he said, “I only cautioned Master Tian not to speak so that we could be sure of bringing our plans to a successful conclusion. Now he has actually killed himself to show me that the secret will never be betrayed — as though I could have intended such a thing!”After Jing Ke had settled himself, the prince moved off his mat, bowed his head, and said,“Master Tian, unaware of how unworthy a person I am, has made it possible for me to speak my thoughts to you. It is clear from this that Heaven has taken pity upon Yan and has not abandoned me altogether.“Qin has a heart that is greedy for gain, and its desires are insatiable. It will never be content until it has seized all the land in the world and forced every ruler within the four seas to acknowledge its sovereignty. Now, having already taken captive the king of Hann and annexed all his lands, Qin has mobilized its troops to strike against Chu in the south, while in the north it stands poised for an attack on Zhao. Wang Jian, leading several hundred thousand troops, is holding Zhang and Ye, while Li Xin leads another force against Taiyuan and Yunzhong. Zhao, unable to withstand the might of Qin, will undoubtedly submit and swear allegiance to it. And when Zhao has gone under, Yan will stand next in line for disaster!“Yan is small and weak, and has often fared badly in war. Even if we were to mobilize the entire nation, we obviously could not stand against Qin; and once the other feudal lords have bowed to its rule, none of them will dare to become our allies. Nevertheless, I have a scheme of my own which, foolish as it may be, I would like to suggest — that is, to find a really brave man who would be willing to go as our envoy to the court of Qin and tempt it with some offer of gain. The king of Qin is greedy, and under the circumstances would surely listen to our offer. If this man could then somehow threaten the king, as Cao Mei threatened Duke Huan of Qi, and force him to return to the feudal lords all the land he has seized, that would be the best we could ask for. And if that proved impossible, he might still be able to stab and kill the king. With the Qin generals free to do as they wished with the troops in the outlying areas, and the Qin court in a state of confusion, dissension would surely arise between ruler and subject. The feudal lords could then take advantage of the situation to band together once more, and in that case the defeat of Qin would be inevitable. This is what I would like to see more than anything else, but I do not know who could be entrusted with such a mission. I can only ask that you give it some thought!”After some time Jing Ke said, “This is a matter of grave importance to the state. I am a person of little worth and I fear I would be unfit for such a mission.” The prince moved forward and, bowing his head, begged and begged Jing Ke to accept the proposal and not to decline any longer, until at last Jing Ke gave his consent. The prince then honoured him with the title of Chief Minister and assigned him the finest quarters in the capital. Every day the prince went to call at his mansion, presenting gifts of food, supplying him with all manner of luxuries, and from time to time pressing him to accept carriages, rider attendants, and waiting women, indulging his every wish so as to insure his cooperation.

久之，荆轲未有行意。秦将王翦破赵，虏赵王，尽收入其地，进兵北略地至燕南界，太子丹恐惧，乃请荆轲曰：“秦兵旦暮渡易水，则虽欲长侍足下，岂可得哉！” 荆轲曰：“微太子言，臣愿谒之。今行而毋信，则秦未可亲也。夫樊将军，秦王购之金千斤，邑万家。诚得樊将军首与燕督亢之地图，奉献秦王，秦王必说见臣，臣乃得有以报。” 太子曰：“樊将军穷困来归丹，丹不忍以己之私而伤长者之意，愿足下更虑之！”
过了一段时间，荆轲还没有动身的意思，这时秦将王翦已经灭掉了赵国，俘虏了赵王，吞并了赵国的全部土地，接着大兵北进，来到了燕国的南部边界。太子丹害怕了，他过去对荆轲说：“秦兵很快就要渡过易水河了，即使我愿意老是这样地伺候您，但又怎么办得到呢！” 荆轲说：“即使您不说，我也早想去向您请示了。现在就是我们到了秦国，因为没有让他们信任的东西，那还是无法接近秦王的。秦国逃来的樊将军，现在秦王正用千金万户的重赏来捉拿他。如果我们能带着樊将军的人头和我国督亢地区的地图，去献给秦王，秦王必然会高兴地接见我，到那时我才能有为您效力的机会。” 太子丹说：“樊将军因为走投无路来投奔我，我不忍心用自己的事情去伤人家的心，请您还是另想别的办法。”
Time passed, but Jing Ke showed no inclination to set out on the mission. Meanwhile the Qin general Wang Jian defeated Zhao, took prisoner its king, and annexed its entire territory. Then he advanced north, seizing control of the land as he went, until he reached the southern border of the state of Yan. Crown Prince Dan, filled with terror, begged Jing Ke to set off. “Any moment now the Qin forces may cross the Yi River, and if that happens, though I might wish to continue to wait upon you, how could I do so?”“I intended to say something, whether you mentioned it or not,” said Jing Ke. “The trouble is that, if I set off now, without any means of gaining the confidence of the king of Qin, I will never be able to get close to him. The king of Qin has offered 1,000 catties of gold and a city of 10,000 households in exchange for the life of his former general, Fan Yuqi. If I could get the head of General Fan and a map of the Dukang region of Yan, and offer to present these to the king of Qin, he would certainly be delighted to receive me. Then I would have a chance to carry out our plan.”But the prince replied, “General Fan has come here in trouble and distress and entrusted himself to me. I could never bear to betray the trust of a worthy man for the sake of my own personal desires. I beg you to think of some other plan.”

荆轲知太子不忍，乃遂私见樊於期曰：“秦之遇将军可谓深矣，父母宗族皆为戮没。今闻购将军首金千斤，邑万家，将奈何？” 於期仰天太息流涕曰：“於期每念之，常痛于骨髓，顾计不知所出耳！” 荆轲曰：“今有一言可以解燕国之患，报将军之仇者，何如？” 於期乃前曰：“为之奈何？” 荆轲曰：“愿得将军之首以献秦王，秦王必喜而见臣，臣左手把其袖，右手堪其匈，然则将军之仇报而燕见陵之愧除矣。将军岂有意乎？” 樊於期偏袒益腕而进曰：“此臣之日夜切齿腐心也，乃今得闻教！” 遂自刭。太子闻之，驰往，伏尸而哭，极哀。既已不可奈何，乃遂盛樊於期首函封之。
荆轲知道太子不忍心，于是私下去找樊於期了。他对樊於期说：“秦国对待您可以说是残酷到极点了，您的父母宗族都被秦王杀尽了，现在他们还用千斤金和万户的重赏来收买您的人头，您准备怎么办呢？” 樊於期仰天长叹，两泪交流地说：“我每逢想到这件事，都是伤心得连骨髓也发疼，只是想不出什么办法！” 荆轲说：“如今有一个法子既可以解除燕国的祸患，又可以为您报得大仇，您想听吗？” 樊於期凑近一步说：“有什么办法？” 荆轲说：“我希望得到您的人头，我拿着它去见秦王，秦王一听必然高兴地接见我，到那时，我左手抓住他的袖子，右手持刀直刺他的胸膛，这样既可以为您报了大仇，又可以为燕国洗去受欺凌的耻辱，您有意这么干吗？” 樊於期一听立即解衣露出了一只膀子，一只手掐着另一只手的腕子，凑近荆轲说：“这正是我日夜咬牙切齿所希望实现的事情，只有今天才能从你这里听到！” 说罢立刻刎颈自杀了。太子丹一听这个消息，赶紧飞车前往，趴在樊於期的身上放声大哭，哭得非常悲痛。但无论如何，人是死了，于是就把樊於期的人头装在匣子里用封条封上。
Jing Ke realized that the prince would never bring himself to carry out his suggestion, and so he went in private to see Fan Yuqi. “Qin’s treatment of you has been harsh indeed!” he said. “Your father, your mother, and all the members of your family have been done away with; and now I hear that Qin has offered a reward of 1,000 catties of gold and a city of 10,000 households for your head! What do you intend to do?” Fan Yuqi looked up to heaven and gave a great sigh, tears streaming down his face. “I think of nothing else, until the ache of it is in my very bones! But I do not know what I can do!” “Suppose I said that one word from you could dispel the troubles of the state of Yan and avenge the wrong you have suffered?” Fan Yuqi leaned forward. “What is it?” he asked. “Give me your head, so that I can present it to the king of Qin! Then he will surely be delighted to receive me. With my left hand I will seize hold of his sleeve, with my right I’ll stab him in the breast, and all your wrongs will be avenged and all the shameful insults which Yan has suffered will be wiped out! What do you say?” Fan Yuqi bared his shoulder and gripped his wrist in a gesture of determination. Moving forward, he said, “Day and night I gnash my teeth and eat out my heart trying to think of some plan. Now you have shown me the way!” Then he cut his throat. When the crown prince heard what had happened, he rushed to the spot and, throwing himself upon the corpse, wept in deep sorrow. But, since there was nothing that could be done, he took Fan Yuqi’s head and sealed it in a box.

于是太子豫求天下之利匕首，得赵人徐夫人匕首，取之百金，使工以药粹之，以试人，血濡缕，人无不立死者。乃装为遣荆卿。燕国有勇士秦舞阳，年十三，杀人，人不敢忤视。乃令秦舞阳为副。荆轲有所待，欲与俱；其人居远未来，而为治行。顷之，未发，太子迟之，疑其改悔，乃复请曰：“日已尽矣，荆轲岂有意哉？丹请得先遣秦舞阳。” 荆轲怒，叱太子曰：“何太子之遣？往而不返者，竖子也！且提一匕首入不测之强秦，仆所以留者，待吾客与俱。今太子迟之，请辞决矣！” 遂发。
这时太子丹事先就已经在各地物色锋利的匕首，后来从赵国徐夫人那里得到了一把，太子丹花了百金把它买过来，又让工匠把它用毒药蘸过，用这把匕首试着刺人，只要擦破一点皮，流出仅能渗湿一根布丝的那么一点血，人就没有一个不立刻死亡的。于是太子丹就把这些东西都为荆轲收拾停当。这时燕国有个勇士叫秦舞阳，早在他十三岁的时候就敢杀人，周围的人们谁都不敢对他反目相看。太子丹就把他找了来，安排他给荆轲当助手。这时荆轲好像是还在等什么人，说是非要那个人来了才一块走。而这个人又离这里很远，还没来，荆轲倒是已经为他收拾好了行装。又过了一阵，荆轲还不动身，太子丹不耐烦了，他怕荆轲变卦，于是就又去催促他说：“已经没有时间了，您还有去的意思吗？不然，我们就先让秦舞阳一个人去吧。” 荆轲一听，生气地对太子丹呵斥道：“用得着您这么催我吗？如果一去回不来，那就是个窝囊废。再说就拿着这么一把匕首去那个变化莫测的秦国行刺，不好好准备怎么能行呢？我所以还不走，是在等我的一个朋友一块去。您现在嫌我行动太慢，那我就马上告辞！” 于是动身出发了。
Earlier he had ordered a search for the sharpest dagger that could be found, and had purchased one from a man of Zhao named Xu Furen for 100 measures of gold. He ordered his artisans to coat the blade with poison and try it out on some men; though the thrust drew hardly enough blood to stain the robe of the victim, every one of the men dropped dead on the spot. The prince then began to make final preparations for sending Master Jing on his mission. There was a brave man of Yan named Qin Wuyang who at age thirteen had murdered someone, and was so fierce that no one dared even to look at him crossly. This man the prince ordered to act as a second to Jing Ke.There was another man whom Jing Ke wished to have along in his party, but he lived a long way off and had not yet arrived in Yan. Meanwhile preparations for the journey were completed but, though time passed, Jing Ke still did not set off. The prince began to fret at the delay and to suspect that Jing Ke had changed his mind. He therefore went to Jing Ke and pressed his request. “The day for departure has already passed, and I am wondering what you intend to do. Perhaps I should send Qin Wuyang on ahead ...”“What do you mean, send Qin Wuyang on ahead?” roared Jing Ke angrily. “Send that little wretch alone and you may be sure he’ll never return successful — setting off with a single dagger to face the immeasurable might of Qin! The reason I have delayed is that I was waiting for a friend I wanted to go with me. But, if you feel it is growing too late, I beg to take my leave.” Then he set out.

太子及宾客知其事者，皆白衣冠以送之。至易水之上，既祖，取道，高渐离击筑，荆轲和而歌，为变徵之声，士皆垂泪涕泣。又前而为歌曰：“风萧萧兮易水寒，壮士一去兮不复还！” 复为羽声慷慨，士皆瞋目，发尽上指冠。于是荆轲就车而去，终已不顾。
这时太子丹以及他的朋友们知道这件事的，都穿着白衣服，戴着白帽子，来给荆轲送行。他们来到了易水河边，祭过了路神，把车子摆在了西去的路上，这时高渐离击筑，荆轲和着筑声引吭高歌，歌声先是用苍凉悲惋的 “变徵” 音调，送行的人们听着一个个都流下了眼泪。接着荆轲又进前唱道：“风萧萧兮易水寒，壮士一去兮不复还！” 随后他们又把曲调变成了激昂慷慨的 “羽调”，这时在场的人们听了都一个个激动得瞪起了眼睛，竖起了头发。荆轲唱罢回身上车扬鞭西驰而去，再也没有回头。
The crown prince and all his associates who knew what was happening put on white robes and caps of mourning to see the party off, accompanying them as far as the Yi River. After they had sacrificed to the god of the road and chosen their route, Gao Jianli struck up his lute and Jing Ke joined in with a song in the mournful bianzhi mode. Tears streamed from the eyes of the company. Jing Ke came forward and sang this song:Winds cry xiao xiao,Yi waters are cold.Brave men, once gone,Never come back again.Shifting to the yu mode with its martial air, Jing Ke sang once more; this time the eyes of the men flashed with anger and their hair bristled beneath their caps. Then he mounted his carriage and set off, never once looking back.

遂至秦，持千金之资币物，厚遗秦王宠臣中庶子蒙嘉。嘉为先言于秦王曰：“燕王诚振怖大王之威，不敢举兵以逆军吏，愿举国为内臣，比诸侯之列，给贡职如郡县，而得奉守先王之宗庙。恐惧不敢自陈，谨斩樊於期之头，及献燕督亢之地图，函封，燕王拜送于庭，使使以闻大王，唯大王命之。”
荆轲来到秦国后，先用价值千金的礼物买通了秦王的宠臣中庶子蒙嘉。蒙嘉受礼后把他们向秦王介绍说：“燕王出于惧怕大王的雄威，已经不敢再兴兵抵抗我国的军队，他们愿意带着整个国家投降我们，给我们做臣仆，等同于我们秦国治下的其他附庸小国，和我们国内的郡县一样给中央进贡，只求让他们保存着他们先王的宗庙不致被毁。由于燕王害怕大王，不敢自己来说，所以先派人带着樊於期的人头和燕国督亢地区的地图来见您。当他们把人头、地图装进匣子，使臣动身来秦的时候，燕王还亲自走到院子里对着使臣叩头跪拜，嘱咐他的使者来对您好好地讲一讲，现在就等您的指示了。”
In time he arrived in Qin, where he presented gifts worth 1,000 measures of gold to Meng Jia, an attendant to the sons of the nobility and one of the king’s favourite ministers. Meng Jia in turn spoke on his behalf to the king of Qin: “The king of Yan, trembling with awe before Your Majesty’s might, has not ventured to call out his troops to oppose our forces, but requests that he and all his people may become vassals of Qin, so that he may be ranked among the other feudal lords and present tribute and perform labour services in the manner of a province or a district; in this way he hopes to be allowed to continue the sacrifices at the temple of his ancestors, the former kings of Yan. In his terror he has not dared to come and speak in person, but has respectfully sent the severed head of Fan Yuqi sealed in a box, along with a map of the Dukang region in Yan, to be presented to you. Bowing respectfully in his courtyard, he has sent these gifts, dispatching his envoys to inquire Your Majesty’s pleasure. He awaits your command.”

秦王闻之，大喜，乃朝服，设九宾，见燕使者咸阳宫。荆轲奉樊於期头函，而秦舞阳奉地图柙，以次进。至陛，秦舞阳色变振恐，群臣怪之。荆轲顾笑舞阳，前谢曰：“北蕃蛮夷之鄙人，未尝见天子，故振慑。愿大王少假借之，使得毕使于前。” 秦王谓轲曰：“取舞阳所持地图。” 轲既取图奏之，秦王发图，图穷而匕首见。因左手把秦王之袖，而右手持匕首揕之。未至身，秦王惊，自引而起，袖绝。拔剑，剑长，操其室。时惶急，剑坚，故不可立拔。荆轲逐秦王，秦王环柱而走。群臣皆愕，卒起不意，尽失其度，而秦法，群臣侍殿上者不得持尺寸之兵；诸郎中执兵皆陈殿下，非有诏召不得上。方急时，不及召下兵，以故荆轲乃逐秦王。而卒惶急，无以击轲，而以手共搏之。是时侍医夏无且以其所奉药囊提荆轲也。秦王方环柱走，卒惶急，不知所为，左右乃曰：“王负剑！” 负剑，遂拔以击荆轲，断其左股。荆轲废，乃引其匕首以擿秦王，不中，中桐柱。秦王复击轲，轲被八创。轲自知事不就，倚柱而笑，箕踞以骂曰：“事所以不成者，以欲生劫之，必得约契以报太子也。” 于是左右既前杀轲，秦王不怡者良久。已而论功赏群臣及当坐者各有差，而赐夏无且黄金二百溢，曰：“无且爱我，乃以药囊提荆轲也。”
秦王一听，非常高兴。于是换上礼服立即升殿，殿前排列着九个候相，用了极其森严隆重的礼节在咸阳宫接见燕国的使者。只见荆轲捧着樊於期的人头盒子走在前面，秦舞阳捧着地图匣跟在后面，两人依次进了宫门。刚走到台阶下，秦舞阳就已经吓得面无人色。秦王的群臣看此光景，觉得很奇怪。这时荆轲回过头来笑看着秦舞阳，替他向秦王打圆场说：“生活在北部蛮夷的小人，从来没有见过天子的威仪，所以一见就害怕了。希望大王能宽恕他，让他能够完成这次出使的任务。” 秦王对荆轲说：“把他手里的地图拿过来。” 于是荆轲就从秦舞阳手里拿过地图送到了秦王面前。秦王接过地图，慢慢地把图卷展开，待至地图展到最后，卷藏在里边的匕首就露出来了。这时荆轲过去左手一把抓住了秦王的袖子，右手抄起匕首向着秦王刺去。匕首还没有刺到身上，秦王吓得站起来往后一扯，袖子被挣断了。接着秦王伸手拔剑，但是佩剑太长，仓促间拔不出来，只是着急地手里抓着剑鞘。由于太紧张、太着急，所以佩剑也就越像是焊住了一样，怎么拔也拔不出来。秦王无法，只好围着柱子乱转，荆轲在后面急急追赶。由于事情来得太突然，所以殿上的群臣先是吓得一愣，而后就全都急得乱了套。当时秦国的法律规定，凡是在殿上站着的群臣不允许携带任何兵器，而所有手持兵器的卫士们只能列队站在台阶下，没有秦王的命令，谁也不能上来。而秦王由于当时正着急没有办法对付荆轲，所以来不及召呼下面的卫士，这就给了荆轲追赶秦王的时间。由于事情来得仓促，殿上的群臣没有任何办法拦阻荆轲，只好空手和荆轲搏斗。这时有个侍候秦王的医生叫夏无且，他用手里的药囊投向荆轲。这时秦王还在围着柱子乱跑，正不知道该怎么办，只听左右有人对他喊道：“大王可以把佩剑推到背后去拔！” 秦王一听醒悟了，他把佩剑向后一推，从背后拔了出来。秦王先是砍断了荆轲的左腿，荆轲瘫倒在地，这时荆轲把他手中的匕首狠狠地向着秦王投去，结果又没有投中，而是投在了一根铜柱上。秦王转身猛地又砍荆轲，这时荆轲已经是八处受伤了。荆轲知道事情已经不能成功，于是就靠着柱子放声大笑，他伸着两腿，高傲地望着秦王骂道：“今天的事情所以没有成功，是因为开始时我想捉活的，想逼着你和我们签订条约，以此来回报燕太子。” 接着秦王左右的人们过去把荆轲杀掉了。而秦王则是为了这事一直过了好久还在闷闷不乐。等到事情过去以后，秦王根据当时的功劳，对有功的进行了不同的奖赏，对有罪的也给予了不同的惩罚。秦王特别赏赐给夏无且黄金二百镒，说：“夏无且是爱我的，当时他用药囊打过荆轲。”
When the king of Qin heard this, he was delighted and, donning his court robes and ordering a full dress reception, he received the envoys of Yan in the Xianyang Palace. Jing Ke bore the box with Fan Yuqi’s head, while Qin Wuyang carried the map case; step by step they advanced through the throne room until they reached the steps of the throne, where Qin Wuyang suddenly turned pale and began to quake with fear. The courtiers eyed him suspiciously. Jing Ke turned around, laughed at Qin Wuyang, and then stepped forward to apologize: “This man is a simple rustic from the barbarous region of the northern border, and he has never seen the Son of Heaven. That is why he shakes with fright. I beg Your Majesty to pardon him for the moment and permit me to complete my mission before you.” “Bring the map he is carrying!” said the king to Jing Ke, who took the map container from Qin Wuyang and presented it to the king. The king opened the container, and when he had removed the map, the dagger appeared. At that moment Jing Ke seized the king’s sleeve with his left hand, while with his right he snatched up the dagger and held it pointed at the king’s breast, but he did not stab him. The king jerked back in alarm and leapt from his seat, tearing the sleeve off his robe. He tried to draw his sword, but it was long and clung to the scabbard and, since it hung vertically at his side, he could not, in his haste, manage to get it out. Jing Ke ran after the king, who dashed around the pillar of the throne room. All the courtiers, utterly dumbfounded by so unexpected an occurrence, milled about in disorder. According to Qin law, no courtier or attendant who waited upon the king in the upper throne room was permitted to carry a weapon of any kind. The palace attendants who bore arms were ranged in the lower hall, and without a command from the king they were forbidden to ascend to the throne room. In his panic the king had no chance to give a command to the soldiers to appear, and thus Jing Ke was able to pursue him. Having nothing with which to strike at Jing Ke, the king in panic-stricken confusion merely flailed at him with his hands. At the same time the physician Xia Wuju, who was in attendance, battered Jing Ke with the medicine bag he was carrying. The king continued to circle the pillar, unable in his confusion to think of anything else to do. “Push the scabbard around behind you!” shouted the king’s attendants, and, when he did this, he was at last able to draw his sword and strike at Jing Ke, slashing him across the left thigh. Jing Ke, staggering to the ground, raised the dagger and hurled it at the king, but it missed and struck the bronze pillar. The king attacked Jing Ke again. Jing Ke, wounded now in eight places, realized that his attempt had failed. Leaning against the pillar, his legs sprawled before him, he began to laugh and curse the king. “I failed because I tried to threaten you without actually killing you and exact a promise that I could take back to the crown prince!” As he spoke, the king’s attendants rushed forward to finish him off. It was a long time before the king regained his composure. When at last he came to himself, he discussed with his ministers the question of who deserved a reward for his part in the incident, and who deserved punishment. To the physician Xia Wuju he presented 200 taels of gold, “because Xia Wuju, out of love for me, hit Jing Ke with his medicine bag.”

于是秦王大怒，益发兵诣赵，诏王翦军以伐燕。十月而拔蓟城。燕王喜、太子丹等尽率其精兵东保于辽东。秦将李信追击燕王急，代王嘉乃遗燕王喜书曰：“秦所以尤追燕急者，以太子丹故也。今王诚杀丹献之秦王，秦王必解，而社稷幸得血食。” 其后李信追丹，丹匿衍水中，燕王乃使使斩太子丹，欲献之秦。秦复进兵攻之。后五年，秦卒灭燕，虏燕王喜。
荆轲这件事更激起了秦王的愤怒，他立即增派部队到赵国去，命令王翦率军北进伐燕。当年十月，攻下了燕国的国都蓟城。燕王喜和太子丹率领着燕国的有生力量，退到了燕国东部的辽东地区。秦国的将领李信对燕王喜追赶得很急，这时赵国的残余势力给燕王喜写信说：“秦军之所以追你追得特别急，是因为你儿子太子丹的缘故。你现在如果能自己杀死太子丹，把他交给秦王，秦王必然会解除对你的追击，这样你的国家或许就能得到保存。” 后来李信追赶太子丹，太子丹逃到了衍水上，燕王喜派人去把太子丹杀了，想把他献给秦王，结果秦国不听，仍是照样进兵。又过了五年，秦国终于灭掉了燕国，俘虏了燕王喜。
After this the king in a rage dispatched more troops to join his army in Zhao and commanded Wang Jian to attack Yan. Ten months later the Qin army captured the city of Ji. King Xi of Yan, Prince Dan, and the others of the court, leading their best troops, fled east to Liaodong for safety. The Qin general Li Xin pursued and attacked them with ever increasing fury. King Jia of Dai sent a letter to King Xi of Yan which read: “It is all because of Prince Dan that Qin is harassing you with such vehemence. If you would only do away with the prince and present his corpse to Qin, the king’s anger would surely be appeased and he would leave you in peace to carry on the sacrifices to your altars of the soil and grain.” Shortly after this, Li Xin pursued Prince Dan as far as the Yan River, where the prince hid among the islands of the river. Meanwhile the king of Yan sent an envoy to cut off the prince’s head, intending to present it to Qin, but Qin dispatched more troops and reopened its attack on Yan. Five years later, Qin finally destroyed the state of Yan and took its ruler, King Xi, prisoner.

其明年，秦并天下，立号为皇帝。于是秦逐太子丹、荆轲之客，皆亡。高渐离变名姓为人庸保，匿作于宋子。久之，作苦，闻其家堂上客击筑，傍徨不能去。每出言曰：“彼有善有不善。” 从者以告其主曰：“彼庸乃知音，窃言是非。” 家丈人召使前击筑，一坐称善，赐酒。而高渐离念久隐畏约无穷时，乃退，出其装匣中筑与其善衣，更容貌而前。举坐客皆惊，下与抗礼，以为上客。使击筑而歌，客无不流涕而去者。宋子传客之，闻于秦始皇。秦始皇召见，人有识者，乃曰：“高渐离也。” 秦皇帝惜其善击筑，重赦之，乃矐其目。使击筑，未尝不称善。稍益近之，高渐离乃以铅置筑中，复进得近，举筑朴秦皇帝，不中。于是遂诛高渐离，终身不复近诸侯之人。
灭燕后的第二年，秦国统一了天下，秦王政改号称为皇帝。接着他下令搜捕太子丹和荆轲的门客党羽，这些门客党羽们都逃跑躲藏起来了。这时高渐离更名换姓，躲在宋子县，给人家当雇工，一直过了好长时间。有一天他干活干累了，忽然他听到主人家有位客人在堂上击筑，高渐离听了半天舍不得离去，忽然脱口说道：“这位先生击筑，有的地方击得好，有的地方击得不好。” 这时主家的一位侍从就把高渐离的话告诉了他的主人，说：“那位伙计懂得音乐，他在那里对刚才的击筑妄加评论。” 这家主人一听，立即就把高渐离叫上来，请他击筑，结果一场表演后，满座的客人都为之叫绝，主人很高兴，立即斟酒给他喝。高渐离心想，自己总是这么躲藏下去，什么时候是个头呢？于是回到自己屋里，从行囊里取出了自己的筑并换上了自己的好衣裳，重新来到主人跟前。在座的客人们一看都大吃一惊，赶紧下来与高渐离见礼，然后把他推到了上座。请他击筑唱歌，客人们听了一个个无不激动得流下了眼泪。从此在宋子城里，大家都轮流请高渐离去作客。很快地消息传到了秦王那里。秦王下令召见高渐离。高渐离一进宫，马上就有人认出了他，说：“这人是荆轲的朋友高渐离。” 秦王听后，一方面他很喜欢高渐离击筑的本领，但另一方面也实在难以饶过他。于是就熏瞎了他的眼睛，让他击筑，秦王每听一次，都觉得不错，于是就渐渐地与高渐离接近了。这时高渐离就暗中在筑里灌满了铅，在后来接近秦王的时候，他突然举筑向秦王砸去，结果没有砸中。于是秦王立即处死了高渐离，从此一辈子再也不接近东方六国的人了。
The following year (221 BC), the king of Qin united all the empire under his rule and assumed the title of August Emperor. The Qin ruler then began a campaign to ferret out the associates of Prince Dan and Jing Ke, and as a result they all went into hiding. Gao Jianli, who was among the group, changed his name, hired himself out as an indentured workman, and went into hiding in a household in the city of Songzi, enduring for a long time the hardships of a labourer’s life. Whenever he heard some guest of the family playing the lute in the main hall of the house, he would linger outside, unable to tear himself away, and after each performance he would say, “That man plays well” or “That man is not very good”. One of the servants reported this to the master of the house, saying, “That hired man must know something about music, since he ventures to pass judgment on everyone’s playing.” The master of the house summoned Gao Jianli to appear and play the lute before his guests, and when he did so, everyone in the company praised his playing and pressed wine on him. Gao Jianli thought of the long time he had been in hiding, and of the seemingly endless years of hardship and want that lay ahead; finally he went back to his room, got his lute and good clothes out of the trunk where he had stored them and, changing his clothes, appeared once more in the hall. The guests were overcome with surprise and, bowing and making room for him as an equal, they led him to the seat of honour and requested him to play the lute and sing. When the performance was over, there was not a guest who left the house dry-eyed. Gao Jianli was entertained at one home after another in Songzi, and in time his fame reached the ears of the Qin emperor. The emperor summoned him to an audience, but when he appeared, someone who had known him in the past exclaimed, “This is Gao Jianli!” The emperor, unable to bring himself to kill such a skilled musician, ordered his eyes put out and commanded him to play in his presence. The emperor never failed to praise his playing and gradually allowed him to come nearer and nearer. Gao Jianli then got a heavy piece of lead and fastened it inside his lute, and the next time he was summoned to play at the emperor’s side, he raised the lute and struck at the emperor. He missed and was summarily executed, and after that the emperor never again permitted any of the former followers of the feudal lords to approach his person.

鲁句践已闻荆轲之刺秦王，私曰：“嗟乎，惜哉，其不讲于刺剑之术也！甚矣，吾不知人也！曩者吾叱之，彼乃以我为非人也！”
鲁句践听说荆轲刺秦王的事情后，自己感慨地说：“可惜呀！荆轲的失误就出在剑术不够精通上。但是我当初也实在太不了解人了！我当时还呵斥过人家，人家自然也不会认为我有多么好了！”
When Lu Goujian heard of Jing Ke’s attempt to assassinate the king of Qin, he sighed to himself and said, “What a pity that he never properly mastered the art of swordsmanship! And as for me — how blind I was to his real worth! That time when I shouted at him in anger, he must have thought I was hardly human!”

太史公曰：世言荆轲，其称太子丹之命，“天雨粟，马生角”也，太过。又言荆轲伤秦王,皆非也。始公孙季功、董生与夏无且游,具知其事，为余道之如是。自曹沫至荆轲五人，此其义或成或不成,然其立意较然，不欺其志,名垂后世，岂妄也哉!
太史公说：社会上流传的荆轲的故事中，曾说太子丹在秦国当人质时，曾感动得天上落下了粮食，马头上长出了犄角，这些说法都太过分了。还说荆轲当时已经刺伤了秦王，这种说法也是不对的。从前公孙季功同董仲舒都曾经同夏无且有过交往，清楚地知道当时的事情，是他们后来对我这么讲的。从曹沫到荆轲一共五个人，他们办的事情有的成功了，有的没有成功，但他们的出发点都很明确，他们决不违背自己的良心。他们的名声流传于后世，这难道是偶然的吗?
The Grand Historian remarks: When people these days tell the story of Jing Ke, they assert that at the command of Prince Dan the heavens rained grain and horses grew horns.175 This is of course a gross error. They likewise say that Jing Ke actually wounded the king of Qin, which is equally untrue. At one time Gongsun Jigong and Master Dong were friends of the physician Xia Wuju and they learned from him exactly what happened. I have therefore reported everything just as they told it to me. Of these five men, from Cao Mei to Jing Ke, some succeeded in carrying out their duty and some did not. But it is perfectly clear that they had all determined upon the deed. They were not false to their intentions. Is it not right, then, that their names should be handed down to later ages?
