孔子曰：“导之以政，齐之以刑，民免而无耻；导之以德，齐之以礼，有耻且格。”老氏称:“上德不德，是以有德；下德不失德，是以无德。法令滋章，盗贼多有。”太史公曰：信哉是言也!法令者治之具,而非制治清浊之源也。昔天下之网尝密矣,然奸伪萌起,其极也，上下相遁，至于不振。当是之时，吏治若救火扬沸，非武健严酷,恶能胜其任而愉快乎!言道德者，溺其职矣。故曰：“听讼，吾犹人也，必也使无讼乎。”“下士闻道大笑之”,非虚言也。汉兴，破觚而为圆，斫雕而为朴，网漏于吞舟之鱼,而吏治烝烝，不至于奸四，黎民艾安。由是观之，在彼不在此。
孔子说：“用政令来引导，用刑罚来约束，老百姓只求免于犯罪而不懂得耻辱。用道德来引导，用礼义来约束，不仅能懂得耻辱，而且能够达到自觉地修身。”老子说：“最高级的道德外表看来像是不讲什么道德，这才是真正的道德。下等的道德要求处处不违背道德，这样只能彻底地丧失道德。法令越是繁杂，盗贼也就越多。”太史公说：这话说得太对了!法令是治理国家的手段，但不是解决社会问题的根本办法。过去秦朝的法网可以说是很严密了，然而奸巧诈伪的事情却层出不穷，发展到极点时从上到下都互相欺骗，以至于发展到不可救药。那时候，法官办案就像救火、扬汤一样，以为像这样如不采取强硬严酷的手段，怎么能解决问题呢?看起来主张以道德治国的人们到这时也毫无办法了。孔子说：“如果叫我审理案件，我也和别人差不多，关键是我能够叫社会上不发生案件。”老子说：“下愚的人一听人家说到‘道’,他就耻笑人家。”这都不是假话。汉朝兴起后，削去一切棱棱角角，免掉一切繁文缛节，当时法网宽松得可以漏掉吞舟的大鱼，然而国家的法治却能纯正厚道，谁也不敢为非作歹，百姓们平安无事。由此看来，关键问题还是要讲道德而不是用严刑。
Confucius said, "If you govern the people by laws and control them with punishments, they will try to keep out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. If you govern them with virtue and control them with ceremony, they will have a sense of shame and correct themselves.” Lao Zi said, "The man of superior virtue does not lay stress on virtue and so he has virtue. The man of inferior virtue clings to virtue and so he has no virtue.” Again, "The more laws are promulgated, the more brigands and thieves there will be.” The Grand Historian comments: How true this is! Laws and codes are instruments of government, but not the cause of good government. In former times the empire was hemmed in by legal restrictions, yet evil and deception grew so rife that those above and those below concealed the truth from each other, until the situation became hopeless. Then the officials' attempt to maintain order was like trying to put out a fire or prevent boiling water from bubbling over. Only the most ruthless and harshest could carry out this task satisfactorily. To have spoken of virtue would have been shirking their duty. That is why Confucius said, "I am no better than others in dealing with lawsuits. The thing is to do away with them." And Lao Zi said, "When men of low understanding hear about the Way, they laugh out loud at it.” These are true words. At the start of the Han Dynasty, smoothness was preferred to sharp angles, simplicity to ornamentation. A whale could have slipped through the net of the law! Yet the law officers were honest and uncorrupted,while the people lived in peace. We can see that this did not come about through harshness.

高后时,酷吏独有侯封，刻铄宗室，侵辱功臣。吕氏已败,遂夷侯封之家。孝景时,晁错以刻深颇用术辅其资,而七国之乱发怒于错，错卒以被戮。其后有郅都、宁成之属。
吕后掌权时，酷吏只有一个侯封，他残酷地凌践刘氏宗室，欺辱元勋旧臣。吕氏失败后，侯封遂被族灭。孝景帝在位时，晁错除了执法严苛外，还很讲究统治术，因而导致七国叛乱时，首先把怒气发泄在晁错身上，结果晁错被杀了。在这之后，以严酷闻名的又有郅都、宁成等人。
In the time of Empress Lü, the only harsh official was Hou Feng, who harried members of the imperial clan and humiliated worthy ministers. But after the Lü clan was overthrown, Hou Feng's family was destroyed. In the reign of Emperor Jing,Chao Cuo was an exacting official who achieved his end partly by cunning. And the seven princes revolted because of their resentment against Chao Cuo, who was finally executed for causing this trouble. After him there were men like Zhi Du and Ning Cheng.

郅都者，杨人也,以郎事孝文帝。孝景时，都为中郎将,敢直谏，面折大臣于朝。尝从入上林,贾姬如厕,野彘卒入厕。上目都,都不行。上欲自持兵救贾姬，都伏上前曰：“亡一姬复一姬进，天下所少宁贾姬等乎?陛下纵自轻，奈宗庙太后何!”上还，彘亦去。太后闻之，赐都金百斤，由此重郅都。
郅都是河东郡杨县人，曾以郎官的身份服侍过孝文帝。孝景帝在位时，郅都做了中郎将，他敢于直言劝谏，能在朝廷上当面驳斥一些大臣的意见。有一次他随从景帝到上林苑，景帝的贾姬上厕所时，一只野猪突然也窜了进去。景帝使眼色让郅都去救贾姬，郅都不去。景帝抄起兵器想自己去救，郅都就跪在景帝面前拦阻说：“失去一个女人，可以再找一个，难道天下缺少这种人吗?即使您不珍惜自己，如果万一出点事，那怎么向整个国家，向您母亲太后交待呢?”于是景帝便停住了，而野猪后来也自己离去了。太后听说这件事，赏给了郅都一百斤金，郅都从此受到了重视。
Zhi Du was a native of Yang. He served under Emperor Wen as a palace guard and Emperor Jing made him captain of the palace guard. He had no scruples about speaking bluntly and would contradict high officials to their faces at court. Once while he was accompanying the emperor to Shanglin Park, Lady Jia went to the privy and a wild boar charged after her. The emperor looked at Zhi Du, who did not move. Then the emperor took a weapon to go to her rescue, but Zhi Du prostrated himself and cried, "If one lady in waiting dies, another can be found. The empire has no lack of Lady Jias! Your Majesty may think lightly of your own safety, but what of the temples of your ancestors? What of the empress dowager?” Then the emperor turned back and the wild boar made off. When this came to the ears of the empress dowager, she gave Zhi Du a hundred catties of gold, and from that time on he was very highly regarded.

济南晌氏宗人三百余家,豪猾,二千石莫能制,于是景帝乃拜都为济南太守。至则族灭晌氏首恶,余皆股栗。居岁余，郡中不拾遗。旁十余郡守畏都如大府。
济南郡的晌氏是个有三百余家的大族，强横奸猾，前几任的郡太守都对他们无法管制，于是景帝就任命郅都去做了济南太守。郅都一到任就把间氏的一些首恶通通灭了族，其余的人吓得个个心惊肉跳。仅仅一年多，郡中就变得路不拾遗了，附近十几个郡的太守都像敬畏上级长官一样敬畏郅都。
Now the clan of Jian in Jinan consisted of more than three hundred families and was so powerful andlawless that not even officials of the two thousand piculs rank could control it. So Emperor Jing appointed Zhi Du as governor of Jinan.Upon his arrival there, he wiped out the ringleaders of the clan together with their relatives, making the rest tremble with fear. In his year and more of office, no one in the province dared to pick up anything that had been dropped in the road, and the dozen or so governors of neighbouring provinces feared him as if he were a chief minister.

都为人勇，有气力，公廉，不发私书,问遗无所受,请寄无所听。常自称曰：“已倍亲而仕,身固当奉职死节官下，终不顾妻子矣。”
郅都为人勇敢，有魄力，公正廉明，谁给他私下写信他都不看，谁送东西他也不要，不接受任何人说情。他经常自勉说：“我既然离开父母出来做官，那就应该奉公守节以身殉职，无论如何不能再顾及妻子儿女。”
ZhiDu was a courageous and powerful man, so scrupulously honest in the conduct of public affairs that he carried on no private correspondence, accepted no gifts and listened to no special requests. He used to say, "Since I left my family and took office, I must do my duty and be ready to die at my post, with no thought of wife and children.”

郅都迁为中尉。丞相条侯至贵倨也,而都揖丞相。是时民朴，畏罪自重，而都独先严酷,致行法不避贵戚,列侯宗室见都侧目而视,号曰“苍鹰”。
后来郅都做了掌管京城治安的中尉。那时朝廷里地位最高待人最傲慢的是丞相条侯周亚夫，可是郅都见了他仅仅是作个揖而已。当时民风朴实，人人自重，都害怕犯罪，而郅都却率先实行严刑酷法，他执法不避权贵，使得那些诸侯王公和皇家宗室都怕得斜着眼看他，给他起了个绰号叫“苍鹰”。
When Zhi Du was transferred to be the metropolitan tribune, the prime minister, the marquis of Tiao, was most powerful and arrogant, yet Zhi Du greeted him as an equal. In those days the common people were simple and honest. Afraid to do anything wrong, they kept out of harm's way. It was Zhi Du who laid stress on severity and applied the full rigour of the law even to relations of the emperor. The feudal lords and members of the imperial clan dared not look him in the face but nicknamed him the Grey Falcon.

临江王征诣中尉府对簿,临江王欲得刀笔为书谢上,而都禁吏不予。魏其侯使人以间与临江王。临江王既为书谢上，因自杀。窦太后闻之，怒，以危法中都,都免归家。孝景帝乃使使持节拜都为雁门太守,而便道之官,得以便宜从事。匈奴素闻郅都节，居边，为引兵去，竟郅都死不近雁门。匈奴至为偶人象郅都，令骑驰射莫能中，见惮如此。匈奴患之。窦太后乃竟中都以汉法。景帝曰：“都忠臣。”欲释之。窦太后曰：“临江王独非忠臣邪!”于是遂斩郅都。
当景帝的儿子临江王刘荣被征到中尉府受审时，刘荣想要刀笔给皇上写信说明情况，郅都不让府吏给他。魏其侯窦婴派人暗中给了临江王。临江王送出书信后就自杀了。窦太后听说此事非常生气，找了一个别的借口说郅都犯了大法，将其罢职为民。而景帝则派了一个使者持着旌节去郅都家任之为雁门太守，让他从家中直接走便道赴任，并授予他遇事可以随机处置的特权。匈奴人早就听说过郅都为人刚直有气节，郅都一到任后，匈奴便自动地把军队撤走了，直到郅都死都没有再靠近雁门。匈奴曾做了一个郅都像，叫骑兵们练习射箭，结果没有一个人能射中，郅都居然能使人怕到这种地步。匈奴把他看作心腹之患。窦太后终究还是援引法律陷害了郅都。景帝说：“郅都是忠臣。”想宽释他。窦太后说：“他是忠臣，难道临江王就不是忠臣吗?”结果郅都就这样被斩了。
When the prince of Linjiang was summoned for trial in Zhi Du's office, he asked for a knife and stylus to write a letter to the emperor, but Zhi Du would not let the officers grant his request. The marquis of Weiqi sent them to him in secret, however, and after writing the letter the prince took his own life. Empress Dowager Dou was so angry when she learned of this that she found some legal pretext to indict Zhi Du, who was dismissed from office and went home. Emperor Jing sent an envoy with credentials to appoint him as governor of Yanmen, ordering him to proceed straight from home to his new post and act there as he thought fit. Since the Huns had long heard that Zhi Du was incorruptible,while he was at the frontier they withdrew their troops, never invading Yanmen so long as he lived. They even carved an effigy of him and made their mounted archers use it as a target, but such was the awe in which they held him that none of them could hit it.He was, indeed, a thorn in the side of the Huns. When Empress Dowager Dou brought another charge against him, the emperor said,“Zhi Du is a loyal subject.” He would have released him, but the empress dowager retorted, "And the king of Linjiang, was he not a loyal subject?” So in the end Zhi Du was executed.

宁成者，穰人也。以郎谒者事景帝。好气,为人小吏，必陵其长吏;为人上，操下如束湿薪。滑贼任威。稍迁至济南都尉,而郅都为守。始前数都尉皆步入府,因吏谒守如县令，其畏郅都如此。及成往，直陵都出其上。都素闻其声，于是善遇，与结驩。久之，郅都死，后长安左右宗室多暴犯法，于是上召宁成为中尉。其治效郅都，其廉弗如，然宗室豪桀皆人人惴恐。
宁成是南阳郡穰县人。开始以一个郎官、谒者的身份服侍汉景帝。宁成为人气盛，他在别人手下当小吏，必定要欺凌他的长官；如果他当别人的长官，则对待部下如同捆湿柴一样把人家整得顺顺溜溜。他狡猾狠毒，好耍威风。当他逐步迁升到济南郡的都尉时，恰好郅都是太守。宁成之前的几任都尉进太守府时都是步行，就像下属的县令一样让府吏领着去拜见郅都，他们对郅都怕成这个样子。现在轮到宁成去见郅都了，他径直进去，比郅都还威风。郅都早就对宁成有过耳闻，他友善地接待了他，和他结成了好友。后来郅都死后，长安一带的宗室贵戚们横行不法的又多起来了，于是景帝便把宁成调为中尉。宁成治理京城的办法与郅都相同，只是不如郅都廉洁，但是那些宗室贵戚和豪强暴徒都怕他。
Ning Cheng of Rang served Emperor Jing first as a palace guard and then as a herald. He was an irascible man. As a subordinate he was rude to his superiors, while he tied down those under him as tightly as a bundle of wet twigs. Through cunning and ruthlessness he was gradually promoted to the post of the military tribune of Jinan, when Zhi Du happened to be the governor there. Former tribunes, such was their fear of Zhi Du, had gone on foot to his office to pay their respects as if they were mere magistrates. Ning Cheng, however, behaved even more arrogantly than Zhi Du. And since the latter knew his reputation, he treated him well and they became good friends. Some years later, after ZhiDu's execution, so many of the emperor's attendants and members of the imperial clan in Chang'an started re- sorting to violence and breaking the law that the emperor summoned Ning Cheng to be metropolitan tribune. His administration was like that of Zhi Du, except that he was not so incorruptible. However, members of the imperial clan and prominent citizens all feared him to a man.

武帝即位,徙为内史。外戚多毁成之短，抵罪髡钳。是时九卿罪死即死,少被刑，而成极刑。自以为不复收,于是解脱,诈刻传出关归家。称曰：“仕不至二千石，贾不至千万，安可比人乎!”乃贳贷买陂田千余顷,假贫民，役使数千家。数年，会赦。致产数千金,为任侠，持吏长短,出从数十骑。其使民威重于郡守。
武帝即位后，宁成调任内史。由于一些外戚攻击宁成的短处，宁成被判髡钳，剃去了头发，脖子上扣了铁箍。当时位至九卿的大官们一般都是一判刑就立即自杀，很少活着接受刑罚的。现在宁成被判了这样的刑没有自杀，而是接受了刑罚。他自己觉得不可能被起用了，于是解脱刑具逃走了，伪造了一份出关的证明，逃回了老家。他扬言说：“做官要是做不到二千石，做买卖要是赚不到一千万，那还能在人前说长道短吗?”于是就向人借钱，买了一千多顷带有水塘可灌溉的土地，租给穷人们种，受他奴役的佃户达到几千家。过了几年，又遇上了大赦，于是宁成算是没事了。这时他的家产已经价值到几千斤金了。宁成好仗义行侠，手中抓着地方官吏们的许多把柄，一出门总跟着几十个随从。他对百姓们发号施令那股威风劲比郡太守还厉害。
When Emperor Wu came to the throne, Ning Cheng was transferred to the prefectship of the capital. Then the relatives of the empress brought a false charge against him. His head was shaved and a chain put round his neck. In those days it was usual for high ministers guilty of capital offences to commit suicide rather than submit to punishment. But Ning Cheng put up with this disgrace and, confident that he would not be arrested again, got rid of his chains, forged a permit to get through the Pass, and returned home. “An official who cannot reach the two thousand piculs rank or a merchant who cannot make ten million cash is no true man," he said. So he borrowed money to purchase a hundred thousand mu and more of hilly land, and got several thousand poor families to work for him. By the time an amnesty was declared a few years later, he was worth several thousand pieces of gold. He took the law into his own hands, bending the local officials to his will. He had a retinue of several dozen horsemen and could order the people about with more authority than the provincial governor.

周阳由者，其父赵兼以淮南王舅父侯周阳，故因姓周阳氏。由以宗家任为郎,事孝文及景帝。景帝时，由为郡守。武帝即位，吏治尚循谨甚,然由居二千石中，最为酷暴骄恣。所爱者，挠法活之；所憎者，曲法诛灭之。所居郡，必夷其豪。为守，视都尉如令；为都尉，必陵太守，夺之治。与汲黯俱为，司马安之文恶，俱在二千石列，同车未尝敢均茵伏。
周阳由的父亲赵兼因为是淮南王的舅舅而被封为周阳侯，于是便改姓周阳。周阳由靠着是刘氏宗室的亲戚而被任为郎官，前后曾服侍过孝文帝和孝景帝。到景帝在位时，周阳由已经做到了郡守。武帝即位后，当时官吏们判案治民一般都还是谨慎宽松的，在郡守国相这种二千石的官吏中，周阳由最以残酷骄暴闻名。对于他所喜欢的犯人，他总是千方百计地枉法让他活命；对于他所憎恶的犯人，就想着法地把他整死。他每到一个郡里，必定要铲平那里的豪强。他要是做太守，就会像对待下属县令那样来对待与他共事的都尉；如果他做都尉，他就必然要反过来欺侮太守，把太守的权都夺过来。即使像汲黯那样的偏狭刚愎，和司马安那样的专以玩弄法律条文害人，他们三人当时都是二千石，但在同坐一辆车子的时候，汲黯和司马安都不敢和周阳由平起平坐。
Zhouyang You's father, originally called Zhao Jian, took the sur- name Zhouyang because as an uncle of the prince of Huainan be was made the marquis of Zhouyang. And owing to this connection he served in the palace guard in the reigns of Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing. Under Emperor Jing he became a provincial governor. When Emperor Wu came to the throne,the local officials exercised their jurisdiction with great moderation. Zhouyang You alone of the officers of the two thousand piculs rank went to extremes in his savage repression and arrogance. If he liked a man he would stretch the law to save his life; if he hated a man he would twist the law to kill him. Whatever province he administered, he invariably killed off its chief citizens. Serving as governor, he treated the military tribune as a county magistrate; serving as a military tribune himself, he insulted the governor and usurped his authority. He was as harsh as Ji An, and as skillful as Sima An in manipulating the law to ruin men; but although both of them belonged to the two thousand piculs rank they never presumed to act as Zhouyang You's equal when riding in the same carriage.

由后为河东都尉,时与其守胜屠公争权,相告言罪。胜屠公当抵罪,义不受刑，自杀，而由弃市。
周阳由后来做河东郡都尉时，与郡太守胜屠公争权，互相攻击告发。胜屠公被判刑后，不愿受辱自杀了，周阳由不自杀遂被处死在街头。
When later Zhouyang You became military tribune of Hedong,he fought for power with the local governor Lord Shentu,and each impeached the other. Lord Shentu was found guilty but committed suicide rather than suffer the punishment. Zhouyang You was executed in the market-place.

自宁成、周阳由之后，事益多,民巧法,大抵吏之治类多成、由等矣。
自宁成、周阳由以后，国家的各种案件越来越多，人们也学得越来越会对付，而官吏们的判案治民则大多数都像宁成、周阳由那种样子了。
After the time of Ning Cheng and Zhouyang You there was an increase in litigation, the law became more involved, and most officials were men of their type.

赵禹者，赘人,以佐史补中都官,用廉为令史,事太尉亚夫。亚夫为丞相，禹为丞相史,府中皆称其廉平。然亚夫弗任,曰：“极知禹无害,然文深，不可以居大府图。”今上时,禹以刀笔吏积劳，稍迁为御史。上以为能，至太中大夫。与张汤论定诸律令,作见知,吏传相监司。用法益刻，盖自此始。
赵禹是葉县人。先是在外郡当小吏，后来调到京城长安做府吏，由于办事廉洁而做了令史，跟着太尉周亚夫。后来周亚夫做了丞相，赵禹就成了丞相史，丞相府里的人们都称赞他廉洁公平，唯有周亚夫不欣赏他。周亚夫说：“我当然也深知赵禹能干，但是这个人执法过严，不能在丞相府管大事。”武帝即位后，赵禹由一个小吏日积月累，升迁做了御史。武帝认为他能干，让他做了太中大夫。赵禹和张汤一起商量制定了各种法令，有一种处置知而不报的所谓“见知”之法，让官吏们互相监视、互相告发就是赵禹、张汤制定的。国家的法令酷刻差不多就从这时开始。
Zhao Yu was a native of Tai. He served first as a district clerk,then as an officer in the capital, where for his scrupulous conduct he was appointed as a secretary under Grand Marshal Zhou Yafu. When Zhou Yafu became prime minister Zhao Yu was his secretary, known to all his colleagues for his integrity and justice. But Zhou Yafu did not trust him. "I know very wellthat Yu is competent," he said. "But he is too harsh to hold a high position." During the present reign, he so distinguished himself as a secretary that step by step he was promoted to the post of censor. The emperor, struck by his ability, made him grand counsellor. With Zhang Tanghe revised the legal codes, drawing up laws dealing with failure to report a crime and the system of mutual surveillance. Since then the laws have been more strictly enforced.

张汤者，杜人也。其父为长安丞,出，汤为儿守舍。还而鼠盗肉，其父怒，笞汤。汤掘窟得盗鼠及余肉，劾鼠掠治,传爰书,讯鞫论报,并取鼠与肉，具狱磔堂下。其父见之，视其文辞如老狱吏，大惊，遂使书狱。父死后，汤为长安吏，久之。
张汤是杜县人。他的父亲是长安县丞。张汤小的时候，有一天他的父亲出门，留下张汤看家，回来发现家里的肉被老鼠偷吃了，他的父亲很生气，打了张汤一顿。于是张汤就挖开老鼠洞捉住了偷肉的老鼠和吃剩的肉，对老鼠进行起诉拷问，他写了老鼠的“口供”和审讯记录，而后在几方面材料具备的情况下进行宣判，把老鼠在院子里剁成了碎块。他的父亲看到了这情景，再看各项“公文”简直就像个老练的狱吏写的，不由大吃一惊，于是就让他学习狱律之事。他的父亲死后，张汤就在长安做了小吏，一直做了很长时间。
Zhang Tang of Du was the son of the assistant magistrate of Chang'an. One day when he was a child his father left him to mind the house, only to find on his return that a rat had stolen a piece of meat. In anger he beat his son. Then Zhang Tang dug out the rathole, found the guilty rat and what remained of the meat, tried the rat,recorded its confession and decided on its punishment. He then took the rat and meat into the yard, where he passed sentence and executed the culprit. His father, observing this, was amazed to find that the records read like those drawn up by an experienced scrivener. So he set the lad to writing legal documents. After his father's death, Zhang Tang served for many years as an officer in the capital.

周阳侯始为诸卿时,尝系长安，汤倾身为之。及出为侯，大与汤交，遍见汤贵人。汤给事内史,为宁成掾。以汤为无害，言大府，调为茂陵尉,治方中。
当周阳侯田胜官居九卿一级的时候，曾有一次因犯罪被关押在长安狱中，当时张汤曾全力为他奔走。等到田胜出来被封侯之后，便与张汤成了莫逆之交，他把张汤引见给了朝中的所有贵人。后来张汤在内史府任职，又跟着宁成当过属吏，宁成觉得张汤精通文法，又把他向上级推荐，于是张汤被调为茂陵尉，主持为武帝预建陵墓的工程。
While the marquis of Zhouyang was still only a minister he was involved in trouble in Chang'an, and Zhang Tang did his utmost to help him. When he was released and ennobled he proved a good friend to Zhang Tang,introducing him to all the important people. Zhang Tang worked in the city prefect's office under Ning Cheng, who recommended him to the court for his outstanding ability, with the result that he was transferred to be military tribune of Maoling in charge of the construction of the imperial mausoleum.

武安侯为丞相,征汤为史。时荐言之天子，补御史，使案事。治陈皇后蛊狱,深竟党与。于是上以为能，稍迁至太中大夫。与赵禹共定诸律令，务在深文，拘守职之吏。已而赵禹迁为中尉，徙为少府,而张汤为廷尉,两人交驩，而兄事禹。禹为人廉倨。为吏以来，舍毋食客。公卿相造请禹,禹终不报谢，务在绝知友宾客之请，孤立行一意而已。见文法辄取，亦不覆案，求官属阴罪。汤为人多诈，舞智以御人。始为小吏，乾没,与长安富贾田甲、鱼翁叔之属交私。及列九卿，收接天下名士大夫，己心内虽不合，然阳浮慕之。
田胜的哥哥武安侯田蚡做了丞相，就把张汤征调去做了丞相史，还时常向武帝推荐他，让他补了御史的缺，派他办理案件。他办理陈皇后所谓使用“巫蛊”害武帝一案时，由于能彻底追查党羽，被武帝认为有才能，升为太中大夫。他和赵禹一起制定各种法令，专门地追求苛深严格以拘制那些在职的官吏。后来赵禹做了中尉，又调为九卿之一的少府，而张汤这时做了廷尉，两人交情很深，张汤把赵禹当兄长对待。赵禹廉直倨傲，从做官以来，家里不养食客。公卿大夫多有来府上拜访的，而赵禹始终没有回访过谁，他决心断绝朋友宾客们的任何请托，而一切按着个人的意思办。只要狱词符合法律条文就定案，也不进行复查，专门打探手下属吏们那些未被人知的罪行。张汤为人狡诈，常凭着一些小聪明整治人。他起初做小吏还不为人重视的时候，曾和长安的富商田甲、鱼翁叔等人私下有交往。待至后来位到九卿时，便开始搜罗交结一些天下著名的士大夫，对于有些人虽然内心与他们不合，但表面上还装得对他们很敬慕。
When the marquis of Wuan became prime minister, he chose Zhang Tang as his secretary and recommended him several times to the emperor, who appointed him a censor. He investigated the charge of witchcraft brought against Empress Chen and made a thorough round up of all her clique. Then the emperor, impressed by his ability, promoted him by degrees to the rank of grand counsellor. He and Zhao Yu together revised the legal code, drawing up strict regulations to control all government officials. Later Zhao Yu was promoted to be metropolitan tribune, then transferred to the post of privy treasurer while Zhang Tang became chief justice. The two men were good friends, Zhang Tang treating Zhao Yu like an elder brother. Zhao Yu was both close-listed and overbearing. During the whole of his official career he did no entertaining.When other ministers called on him, he never returned their calls. He made every effort to forestall requests from friends and visitors and took an independent stand, doing whatever he pleased. He based all his decisions on the legal code, would never reopen a case, and was on the look-out for secret malpractices among his subordinates. Zhang Tang was a hypocrite who resorted to cunning to get the better of others. Starting out as a minor official, he engaged in speculation and made friends with Tian Jia, Yu Wengshu and other rich merchants in the capital. When he became one of the nine chief ministers he befriended the most noted scholars and gentlemen of the empire, making a show of admiring even those he disliked.

是时上方乡文学,汤决大狱，欲傅古义,乃请博士弟子治《尚书》、《春秋》补廷尉史，亭疑法。奏谳疑事,必豫先为上分别其原。上所是，受而著谳决法廷尉，絜令扬主之明。奏事即谴，汤应谢，乡上意所便，必引正、监、掾史贤者,曰：“固为臣议，如上责臣，臣弗用，愚抵于此。”罪常释。间即奏事，上善之，曰：“臣非知为此奏，乃正、监、掾史某为之。”其欲荐吏,扬人之善蔽人之过如此。所治即上意所欲罪，予监史深祸者;即上意所欲释，与监史轻平者。所治即豪，必舞文巧诋;即下户羸弱，时口言，虽文致法，上财察。于是往往释汤所言。汤至于大吏，内行修也。通宾客饮食。于故人子弟为吏及贫昆弟，调护之尤厚。其造请诸公，不避寒暑。是以汤虽文深意忌不专平，然得此声誉。而刻深吏多为爪牙用者，依于文学之士四。丞相弘数称其美"。及治淮南、衡山、江都反狱，皆穷根本。严助及伍被，上欲释之。汤争曰：“伍被本画反谋，而助亲幸出入禁闼爪牙臣，乃交私诸侯如此，弗诛，后不可治。”于是上可论之”。其治狱所排大臣自为功，多此类。于是汤益尊任，迁为御史大夫。
这时汉武帝正搞尊儒，张汤每判大案，也总想使它符合古代圣人的义理，于是就请了一些研究《尚书》、《春秋》的博士弟子们做了廷尉史，让他们讨论疑难案件。张汤每当要向皇帝请示疑难案件的处理时，总是预先向皇上说明事情的本末，皇上倾向于怎么处理，他就写成案卷交由廷尉府宣判，并作为案例记载下来，以显示皇帝的英明。如果汇报的事情受到皇帝责备时，张汤便赶紧认错，顺着皇帝的意思，引用自己下属的廷尉正、廷尉监、或是某个有贤名的吏目说：“他们本来为我出过这个主意，就像皇上批评我的一样，我当时愚蠢没有采纳，以致导致这种错误。”而事情也就因此过去了。当他向皇帝汇报某事，受到皇帝的称赞时，他就说：“我当初本不想这么办，这是我手下某个廷尉正、廷尉监、或某个吏目坚持要我这么办的。”他就是这么推荐人，这么喜欢扬人之善，隐人之过。如果审理的是皇上想要加罪的人，他就有意地把他交给那些严酷的属吏去办；如果他审理的是皇上想要放过的人，他就把他交给那些宽和公平的属吏去办。如果审理的是豪强，那他肯定就要罗织罪名将他治罪；如果审理的是一些平民弱者，就随时在皇帝面前为之说情，即使有明确的条文不能不判，他也要交上去让皇帝裁决。而皇上也就往往按着张汤所说的那样使其获释了。张汤虽然已身居廷尉这样的要职，但他要求自己很严。他自己的饮食和门下的食客一样，对手下的一些老朋友的子弟以及他本家的那些贫穷的弟兄们，他照顾得尤其周到。他不管寒冬还是酷暑，都经常去拜访朝中的各位公卿大臣。因此张汤虽然执法酷刻，阴狠不公平，但在上层却有很好的名声。他手下那些阴狠酷刻的属吏一定要有儒生给他们相配合，才能被张汤视为心腹，丞相公孙弘多次称赞过他们。后来在审理淮南王刘安、衡山王刘赐以及江都王刘建谋反的案件时，张汤都进行了穷追深挖，对于刘安的党羽严助、伍被两个人，武帝本来是想宽释的，但张汤坚持说：“伍被是策划谋反的主要人物，而严助身为出入宫廷禁地的陛下的亲幸，居然敢与外面的诸侯相勾结，这种人如果不处死，其他的事情就没法办了。”于是武帝核准了张汤的意见。张汤在审判案件时经常排除其他大臣的意见而要使自己的意见得以施行，他的办事大多如此。而张汤却因此越发受到尊宠和信用，很快升任了御史大夫。
At that time the emperor took a great interest in literature. So when Zhang Tang was dealing with important cases he tried to find support for his views in the classics. He asked students of the court scholars who were familiar with the Book of Documents and Spring and Autumn Annals to serve as secretaries in the office of the chief justice and help settle dubious points of law. Before presenting a decision on controversial cases, he would analyse them for the emperor, then bring in a verdict according to the emperor's instructions and pay open tribute to his sagacity. If he was criticized for some report, he would apologize and fall in with the emperor's wishes. Then he made a point of mentioning one of his more capable subordinates, saying, "So-and-so's advice coincided with Your Majesty's instructions; but I failed to take it and made this stupid mistake. "As a result, the fault was always condoned. If the emperor approved of some report, Zhang Tang would say, "This was not originally my idea, but proposed by so-and-so in my office.” This was how he recommended his officials, bringing forward their good points and hiding their faults. When it came to trials, those whom the emperor wished to condemn Zhang Tang handed over to his most implacable secretaries, while those whom the emperor wanted to have pardoned he assigned to more lenient men. When trying someone wealthy and influential, he would manipulate the law to prove his guilt. But he always took the side of the weak and poor, and even if the man was guilty according to the law Zhang Tang would often speak well of him in front of the emperot. Thus when the case came to the attention of the emperor he would remember what Zhang Tang had said and pardon the man. Zhang Tang's behaviour was exemplary after he became a high official. He supplied all his protégés with food and drink, showing special regard for those officers who were the sons and younger brothers of old friends, as well as for poor relations. He called on other officials regardless of the cold or heat. So in spite of his harshness in applying the law, in spite of his cunning, prejudices and bias, he won fame. Many ruthless officials came to work for him, as well as men of letters, and on several occasions the prime minister Gongsun Hong commended his virtue. When investigating the rebellion of the princes of Huainan,Hengshan and Jiangdu, Zhang Tang went to the root of the matter and opposed the emperor's wish to pardon Yan Zhu and Wu Bei. “It was Wu Bei who drew up the plan for revolt ,"he said. “As for Yan Zhu, he enjoyed your favour and was a trusted official with access to the inner palace, yet he had private dealings with the princes. If men like these are not executed, things will get out of hand.” Then the emperor accepted his recommendation. This is only one example of the way in which Zhang Tang utilized prosecutions to sweep aside other high officials and win credit himself. So he was appointed to more important posts and finally promoted to be grand secretary.

会浑邪等降,汉大兴兵伐匈奴,山东水旱,贫民流徙，皆仰给县官,县官空虚。于是丞上指,请造白金及五铢钱,笼天下盐铁,排富商大贾,出算缗令,钽豪强并兼之家四，舞文巧诋以辅法。汤每朝奏事，语国家用,日晏，天子忘食。丞相取充位,天下事皆决于汤。百姓不安其生，骚动，县官所兴,未获其利，奸吏并侵渔,于是痛绳以罪。则自公卿以下，至于庶人，咸指汤。汤尝病，天子至自视病，其隆贵如此。
由于匈奴浑邪王等率兵来降而朝廷需加赏赐，再加上汉朝连年兴兵讨伐匈奴，又赶上崤山以东的各郡县不是水灾便是旱灾，贫苦百姓到处流浪，这些都靠国家供给，弄得国库十分空虚。于是张汤便摸准武帝的心思，提出制造白金和五铢钱，并同时垄断了全国的盐铁生产和销售。为了排斥打击大商人，他们颁布了“算缗令”以打击各地的豪强大户，他们舞文弄法千方百计陷人于罪。张汤每次上朝奏事，讲起国家该干些什么,滔滔不绝，一直讲到很晚，皇帝听得忘记了吃饭，丞相不过是虚有其位，天下大事都由张汤来决定。百姓们受不了这种严酷的统治，经常发生骚动。国家实行了那些新的经济政策，也得不到什么真正的效益，而中间许多贪官恶吏则大肆侵吞公财，鱼肉百姓，于是张汤只好又用严刑酷法来狠狠地惩办他们。结果闹得上至公卿，下至平民百姓，都指斥张汤。而张汤有一次生病了，竟连皇帝都亲自前往探看，可见张汤的受宠到了什么程度。
When the Hunye and other Hunnish tribes surrendered, the Han (206B.C.-8A.D.)government sent out great armies against the Huns. There were flood and drought in the eastern provinces and the destitute were roaming the country, depending upon relief from the local authorities, whose resources were soon exhausted. Then Zhang Tang, at the wish of the emperor, proposed minting wuzhu and silver coins, setting up a state monopoly of salt and iron, and restricting the great merchants. He drew up a law promising a reward for information about tax-evasion, attacked the powerful families which were annexing land,and twisted the law to make its enforcement even stricter. When Zhang Tang went to court to report on affairs of state, the emperor would forget to eat till sunset. The prime minister was no more than a figurehead, for all affairs in the empire were decided by Zhang Tang. Then the people, dissatisfied with their life,grew restive, and the government derived no profit from the new measures, for corrupt officials appropriated the gains. So such offences were more severely punished. Zhang Tang was hated by everyone from the high officials down to the common people. Yet when he fell ill the emperor went in person to see him, so greatly did he favour and respect him.

匈奴来请和亲,群臣议上前。博士狄山曰：“和亲便。”上问其便，山曰：“兵者凶器，未易数动。高帝欲伐匈奴，大困平城，乃遂结和亲。孝惠、高后时,天下安乐。及孝文帝欲事匈奴，北边萧然苦兵矣。孝景时，吴楚七国反，景帝往来两宫间,寒心者数月。吴楚已破，竟景帝不言兵，天下富实。今自陛下举兵击匈奴,中国以空虚,边民大困贫。由此观之，不如和亲。”上问汤，汤曰：“此愚儒，无知。”狄山曰：“臣固愚忠，若御史大夫汤乃诈忠。若汤之治淮南、江都，以深文痛诋诸侯，别疏骨肉，使蕃臣不自安”。臣固知汤之为诈忠。”于是上作色曰:“吾使生居一郡,能无使虏入盗乎?”曰：“不能。”曰：“居一县?”对曰：“不能。”复曰：“居一障间?”山自度辩穷且下吏,曰：“能。”于是上遣山乘障。至月余，匈奴斩山头而去。自是以后，群臣震慑。
匈奴派使者来请求与汉朝和亲，百官群臣在武帝面前讨论这个问题。博士狄山说：“和亲有利。”武帝问他有什么利，狄山说：“军队武器是凶器，不能频繁使用。当年高皇帝去讨伐匈奴，被围困在平城，结果还是与人家缔结了和亲条约。孝惠帝和高皇后在位时没有打仗，天下安宁。后来孝文帝想征讨匈奴，从此北方边境地区骚动不安受尽了战争之苦。孝景帝在位的时候，发生了吴楚七国的叛乱，骨肉间发生了战争，景帝不断到东宫与太后商议对策，一连几个月都很痛苦。所以吴楚叛军被打败后，景帝到死再也不提打仗的事，而国家也一天天富强起来了。这以后自从陛下发兵征讨匈奴以来，闹得国家内部空虚，边境地区的人民都非常贫困。由此看来，打仗不如和亲有利。”武帝问张汤的意见，张汤说：“这是个愚儒，无知得很。”狄山说：“我虽然‘愚’,但却真心忠诚于主上，不像张汤那样是假装的忠诚。张汤当年审理淮南王、江都王的案件，就是千方百计舞文弄法，强加罪名，离间陛下的骨肉至亲间的关系，使得各诸侯王们恐慌不安。所以我说张汤的‘忠'是假的。”武帝听罢，气得变了脸色，他问狄山说：“我派你去做个郡太守，你能制止敌人的入侵吗?”狄山说：“不能。”武帝说：“让你去守一个县呢?”狄山回答说：“也不能。”武帝又说：“让你去一个要塞如何?”狄山暗想，如果再说不行就非被下狱不可了，于是就说：“能。”于是武帝就派狄山去据守一个要塞。结果只一个多月，狄山的头就被匈奴削走了。从此以后，朝中百官群臣谁都不敢再得罪张汤。
Now the Huns made overtures for peace and the ministers dis- cussed their request in the emperor's presence. A court scholar named Di Shan said, "To make peace is best." Asked by the emperor for his reasons ,he said, “Arms are weapons of destruction which should not be resorted to lightly or too often. When Emperor Gaozu wanted to attack the Huns he got into serious difficulties at Pingcheng, after which he made peace with them. In the time of Emperor Hui and the empress dowager the empire enjoyed peace. Then Emperor Wen decided to deal with the Huns, and the northern borders were laid waste by war. During the reign of Emperor Jing, when the princes of Wu, Chu and five other states rebelled, the emperor was constantly going from his own palace to that of the empress dowager to consult her during those anxious months, and once the revolt was suppressed he never again spoke of war and the empire prospered. Now since Your Majesty sent out expeditions against the Huns, the empire has become exhausted while the people at the borders are in desperate straits. For these reasons I say it would be best to make peace.” The emperor then asked Zhang Tang's opinion. "This Confucian is an ignorant fool," said Zhang Tang. "My loyalty may be foolish," retorted Di Shan. "But the loyalty of the chief counsellor Zhang Tang is spurious. Take the way he handled the case of the princes of Huainan and Jiangdu. He prosecuted them with the utmost rigour of the law, estranging those of one flesh and blood and spreading unrest among the princes. So I know that his loyalty is nothing but an outward show.” The emperor's face darkened and he demanded, "If I gave you a province to govern, could you keep the barbarians from invading it?” "No, I could not," admitted Di Shan. "How about a county?" "No." “One frontier post, then?” Fearful of being put on trial if his answer was found wanting, Di Shan replied, "Yes,I could manage that." Then the emperor sent him to hold a frontier post, but in little more than a month Hunnish raiders cut off his head. After that all the other officials were thoroughly cowed.

汤之客田甲，虽贾人，有贤操。始汤为小吏时，与钱通;及汤为大吏，甲所以责汤行义过失,亦有烈士风。
张汤的老朋友田甲，虽然是个商人，但却有很好的品质。当初张汤做小吏的时候，田甲同他有财务上的往来，等到张汤做了大官，田甲还能当面指责张汤的过失，是个很有气节的人。
One of Zhang Tang's protegés, Tian Jia, was a merchant but a man of good character. When Zhang Tang was a minor official he had certain transactions with him, but after Zhang Tang became a high official Tian Jia used to criticize him for his faults like a man of honour.

汤为御史大夫七岁,败。河东人李文尝与汤有卻,已而为御史中丞，恚,数从中文书事有可以伤汤者,不能为地。汤有所爱史鲁谒居,知汤不平,使人上蜚变告文奸事。事下汤,汤治论杀文,而汤心知谒居为之。上问曰：“言变事纵迹安起?”汤详惊曰：“此殆文故人怨之。”谒居病卧闾里主人,汤自往视疾，为谒居摩足。赵国以冶铸为业，王数讼铁官事，汤常排赵王。赵王求汤阴事。谒居尝案赵王,赵王怨之，并上书告：“汤，大臣也，史谒居有病，汤至为摩足，疑与为大奸。”事下廷尉。谒居病死，事连其弟，弟系导官。汤亦治他囚导官,见谒居弟，欲阴为之，而详不省。谒居弟弗知，怨汤，使人上书告汤与谒居谋，共变告李文。事下减宣"。宣尝与汤有卻,及得此事，穷竟其事,未奏也。会人有盗发孝文园瘗钱，丞相青翟朝”,与汤约俱谢。至前，汤念独丞相以四时行园,当谢，汤无与也，不谢。丞相谢，上使御史案其事。汤欲致其文丞相见知，丞相患之。三长史皆害汤,欲陷之。
张汤做了七年御史大夫后，终于垮台了。河东人李文曾经和张汤有怨隙，后来李文做了张汤手下的御史中丞，他心怀旧恨，只要能从张汤与朝廷上下往来的文书中找出伤害张汤的地方，他就绝不放过。张汤有个心爱的小办事员名叫鲁谒居，他知道张汤对李文不满，就指示人写匿名信告发李文企图谋反，这个案件交给张汤审理，张汤就判李文死罪把他杀了。张汤心里明白，告发信是鲁谒居写的。但当武帝问张汤说：“李文谋反的事告发人从哪里得到的线索?”张汤却假做吃惊地说：“大概是由于李文旧日的朋友同事恨他吧。”后来鲁谒居生了病，住在他租来的一所平民的房子里，张汤亲自去探病，给鲁谒居按摩腿脚。当时赵国的冶铁业发达，赵王曾多次告过朝廷派去的铁官的状，而张汤在处理这种纠纷上常常压抑赵王。于是赵王就注意寻找张汤的隐私。而鲁谒居偏偏又正好审问过赵王的事情，赵王怨恨他，于是就一并上书告发说：“张汤是朝廷大臣，他手下的一个小令史鲁谒居有了病，张汤居然亲自去为他按摩腿脚，我怀疑他们之间有大问题。”案件交由廷尉审理，结果鲁谒居病死，鲁谒居的弟弟受牵连被关进少府的导官署。有一次张汤去导官署审理别的犯人，看到了鲁谒居的弟弟，他想暗中营救他，但表面上却假装不认识的样子。鲁谒居的弟弟不理解他的用意，怨恨张汤不救他，于是就让别人上书告发张汤曾与鲁谒居合谋，说李文谋反是他们共同诬告的。武帝把这事交给御史中丞减宣审理。减宣曾经和张汤有矛盾，他接手这个案子后，穷追不放，但还没有向皇帝上奏，恰好这时有人盗挖了孝文帝陵园里埋藏的钱。丞相庄青翟同张汤约好上朝时一起向武帝检讨没有尽到责任，待至到了武帝跟前，张汤心想按规定只有丞相负责每年四季巡视陵园，出了问题丞相应当认错，而自己是与此无关的，所以又临时变卦了。丞相认错后，武帝让御史审理此事。张汤想给丞相加上一个“见知故纵”的罪名，丞相很害怕。这时刚好丞相府的三位长史朱买臣、王朝、边通都恨张汤，想设法陷害他。
Zhang Tang served as grand secretary for seven years before his downfall. Li Wen of Hedong bore Zhang Tang a grudge. After he became an assistant to the grand secretary, his resentment rankled and he searched the files for incriminating documents, but could find none. One of Zhang Tang's favourite secretaries, Lu Yeju, knew that the grand secretary was uneasy on this score and persuaded someone to impeach Li Wen. The case was referred to Zhang Tang, who had Li Wen sentenced to death. Zhang Tang knew quite well that Lu Yeju was behind this,but when the emperor asked, "Who brought this charge of sedition?" he put on a look of surprise and replied, "I suppose it was some old acquaintance who disliked Li Wen." When Lu Yeju fell ill and was lying in bed in the house of a neighbour, Zhang Tang went in person to ask after him and massaged his feet for him. The main industry in the principality of Zhao is iron smelting, and the prince of Zhao repeatedly went to law with the government officer in charge of this industry, but Zhang Tang always took the latter's side. So the prince was eager to catch Zhang Tang out. And he also hated Lu Yeju, who had once filed charges against him. He therefore addressed a memorial to the throne saying that Zhang Tang was a high minister, yet when his secretary Lu Yeju fell ill he had gone so far as to massage his feet for him. He suspected that they must be plotting treason together. By the time the matter was referred to the chief justice Lu Yeju had died of illness, but the case involved his younger brother, who was detained in the retainers' office. Zhang Tang happened to be investigating a case in that office and, noticing Lu Yeju's brother, he was eager to help him; but wanting to do so in secret, he pretended not to know him. The young man, not realizing this, was highly indignant and got someone to write a memorial to the throne accusing Zhang Tang of plotting with Lu Yeju to charge Li Wen with sedition. The matter was investigated by Jian Xuan, and as he had a grudge against Zhang Tang he went into the case very thoroughly. Before Jian Xuan submitted a report, Emperor Wen's sepulchre was opened and coins stolen from it. The prime minister Zhuang Qingdi and Zhang Tang agreed to go to court together to apologize for this. Before they reached the court, however, Zhang Tang decided that since it was the prime minister's duty to make seasonal inspections of the burial grounds, he himself was in no way responsible and need not apologize. After the prime minister made his apologies ,the emperor ordered Zhang Tang to investigate the case. Zhang Tang wanted to prove that the prime minister was to blame, and Zhuang Qingdi was seriously alarmed. At this time the three chief secretaries of the prime minister's office hated Zhang Tang and were eager to ruin him.

始长史朱买臣,会稽人也。读《春秋》。庄助使人言买臣,买臣以《楚辞》与助俱幸,侍中,为太中大夫，用事；而汤乃为小吏，跪伏使买臣等前。已而汤为廷尉，治淮南狱，排挤庄助,买臣固心望。及汤为御史大夫，买臣以会稽守为主爵都尉,列于九卿。数年，坐法废，守长史”,见汤，汤坐床上，丞史遇买臣弗为礼。买臣楚士,深怨，常欲死之。王朝，齐人也，以术至右内史。边通，学长短,刚暴强人也，官再至济南相。故皆居汤右,已而失官，守长史，诎体于汤。汤数行丞相事,知此三长史素贵，常凌折之。以故三长史合谋曰：“始汤约与君谢,已而卖君；今欲劾君以宗庙事，此欲代君耳。吾知汤阴事。”使吏捕案汤左田信等?,曰汤且欲奏请，信辄先知之,居物致富,与汤分之，及他奸事。事辞颇闻。上问汤曰：“吾所为，贾人辄先知之，益居其物,是类有以吾谋告之者。”汤不谢。汤又详惊曰：“固宜有。”减宣亦奏谒居等事。天子果以汤怀诈面欺，使使八辈簿责汤。汤具自道无此，不服。于是上使赵禹责汤。禹至，让汤曰：“君何不知分也。君所治夷灭者几何人矣?今人言君皆有状,天子重致君狱，欲令君自为计,何多以对簿为?”汤乃为书谢曰：“汤无尺寸功，起刀笔吏，陛下幸致为三公，无以塞责。然谋陷汤罪者，三长史也。”遂自杀。
长史朱买臣是会稽人，是研习《春秋》的。他的同乡庄助托人在武帝面前说朱买臣精通《楚辞》,于是朱买臣和庄助一并受到了武帝的宠幸，武帝把他们留在身边，封他们为太中大夫，很有些权力。而那时张汤还是个小吏，见到朱买臣等人总要跪拜行礼，听他们差遣。后来张汤做了廷尉，在审理淮南王谋反一案时，借机排挤杀害了庄助，为此朱买臣早已对张汤怨恨在心。后来张汤做了御史大夫位列三公，朱买臣才刚从会稽太守调为主爵都尉，享受九卿待遇。过了几年，朱买臣又因触犯法律免官，在丞相府权充长史，这时他每次去见张汤时，张汤总是坐在位子上不动，把他作为一个丞相府派来的小办事员而不以礼相待。朱买臣是楚地的名士，对张汤的无礼深为怨恨，常想置张汤于死地。长史王朝是齐国人。由于精通学术而做到了右内史。长史边通，研习战国纵横之学，是一个刚强暴戾的人，曾两次做过济南相。他们三个人的旧有职位都曾比张汤高，后来因为都丢了官，所以才充当了丞相长史，都屈居于张汤之下了。张汤曾几次代理过丞相的职权，他深知这三位长史一向架子大，就故意地欺凌折侮他们。因此到了今天这三位长史就一起商量说：“当初张汤说好了要和我们丞相一起向皇上谢罪，结果到时候却背叛耍弄了我们丞相，现在他又想借孝文陵园被盗这件事来对我们丞相进行弹劾，这分明是想取而代之。我可是知道张汤干的那些见不得人的事。”于是首先派人逮捕了与张汤有牵连的田信，说：“张汤每打算向朝廷奏请什么事情，田信都预先知道，并因此买进卖出发了财，而后与张汤平分，此外还有许多其他事情。”这些说法传到了武帝的耳朵里。武帝问张汤说：“我准备办的事情，有的商人总是早早知道了，于是他们便大批地买入，很像是有人把我的打算预先告诉了他们。”张汤不认错。他又假装吃惊地说：“看来像是真有人泄密。”这时御史中丞减宣又向武帝报告了张汤和鲁谒居合谋陷害李文等事情。于是武帝遂认为张汤心怀诈伪，当面欺君，一连派了八批使者手持文书来责问张汤的罪行。张汤自己说没有这些事，对于所加给的罪名不服气。于是武帝又派赵禹去责问张汤。赵禹一来，就责备张汤说：“你也太不顾自己的身份了。被你宣判杀头灭族的人有多少?现在别人对你的告发都是有根有据的，皇上不忍将你下狱，给你留点面子想让你自杀了事，你搞什么一项一项地自陈呢?”张汤这才写了一封谢恩书说：“我没有任何功劳，只是由一个刀笔小吏幸蒙陛下垂用而位列三公，我没有完成好皇上交给我的任务。但合谋陷害我的，是丞相府的三位长史。”写完后就自杀了。
One of them, Zhu Maichen ofKuaiji, had made a study of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Zhuang Zhu induced someone to recommend him to the emperor and both he and Zhuang Zhu won the imperial favour. Zhu Maichen was favoured because of his knowledge of the Literature of Chu. They were serving in the palace as grand counsellors while Zhang Tang was still a minor officer who had to kneel before them. After Zhang Tang became chief justice and investigated the case of the prince of Huainan, he vented his dislike of Zhuang Zhu and Zhu Maichen by denouncing them. Later Zhang Tang became grand secretary while Zhu Maichen served as governor of Kuaiji and then as the officer in charge of the principalities, ranking as one of the nine chief ministers. A few years later, being charged with some offence, he was removed from his post and made a secretary. When he called on Zhang Tang, the latter did not rise from his couch but treated him as unceremoniously as if he were a petty clerk. Zhu Maichen, a true man of Zhu, was consumed with indignation and cast about for means to kill Zhang Tang. Then there was Wang Chao of Qi, who became senior city prefect through his knowledge of the classics. And Bian Tong, a man of a stubborn, violent temper, who had studied oratory and twice served as the minister of Jinan. All three of these men ranked above Zhang Tang till they lost their posts and became secretaries of the prime minister, lower in position than Zhang Tang. On several occasions when he was acting prime minister, knowing that these three men had held high positions, he went out of his way to insult them. Accordingly these three secretaries plotted together and told the prime minister,“ Zhang Tang went with you, sir, to apologize to the emperor, but then let you down. Now he intends to impeach you over the desecration of the ancestral temple so that he can take your place. But we know his guilty secrets.” They sent officers to arrest Zhang Tang's friend Tian Xin and other merchants on the charge that Tian Xin knew in advance whatever memorial Zhang Tang was going to present, and that he shared the wealth made in this way with Zhang Tang. There were other charges too. When the emperor learned of this he said to Zhang Tang, "The merchants know all my decisions in advance and hoard certain commodities. Someone must be disclosing my plans to them.” Instead of apologizing, Zhang Tang put on an air of surprise and said, "Yes, it certainly looks like that." Jian Xuan also submitted his report on Lu Yeju and others. Then the emperor realized that Zhang Tang had deceived him and sent eight officers to check up on his records. But Zhang Tang denied all guilt and would not confess. The emperor ordered Zhao Yu to reprove him. Zhao Yu went to Zhang Tang and said scathingly, “Can' t you understand the position you are in? Not even after all the men you have condemned to death with their whole families? All the charges against you are backed by written evidence. The emperor has ordered an investigation because he wants you to choose your own way to die. What good would a long trial do?” Then Zhang Tang wrote an apology, saying, “Although with no vestige of merit, I was raised by Your Majesty's favour from the position of a clerk with knife and stylus to become one of the three highest ministers. It is true I have failed in my duty, but I am the victim of a plot by the three secretaries of the prime minister." Then he committed suicide.

汤死，家产直不过五百金,皆所得奉赐,无他业。昆弟诸子欲厚葬汤，汤母曰：“汤为天子大臣，被污恶言而死，何厚葬乎!”载以牛车，有棺无椁。天子闻之，曰：“非此母不能生此子!”乃尽案诛三长史。丞相青翟自杀。出田信。上惜汤,稍迁其子安世。
张汤死后，他的家产价值不过五百金，都是他所得到的俸禄和赏赐，没有其他产业。他的兄弟和孩子们打算为他办个隆重的葬礼，他的母亲说：“张汤作为天子的大臣，遭受了别人的诬陷而冤死，还搞什么隆重的葬礼!”于是就用牛车拉着张汤的棺材，棺材外面连一个套棺都没有。武帝得悉后，感叹地说：“不是这样了不起的母亲，就不能生养这样的儿子。”于是就把三位长史一齐下狱处死。丞相庄青翟也被迫自杀。田信也被放了出来。由于武帝惋惜张汤的死，便提拔了他的儿子张安世。
After his death his property was found to amount to no more than five hundred pieces of gold, and these had been a gift from the emperor. He had no other estate. His younger brothers and sons would have given him a fine funeral had not his mother objected. "He was a high minister serving the Son of Heaven, yet he got a name for corruption and took his own life," she said. "Why should he have a fine funeral?” So they had his coffin loaded on to an ox-cart and gave him no outer coffin. When this came to the ears of the emperor he remarked, “Only such a mother could have had such a son!" He had the three secretaries tried and executed. The prime minister committed suicide and Tian Xin was released. Because the emperor regretted Zhang Tang's death, he promoted his son Zhang Anshi.

赵禹中废，已而为廷尉。始条侯以为禹贼深,弗任。及禹为少府,比九卿,禹酷急。至晚节，事益多，吏务为严峻，而禹治加缓，而名为平。王温舒等后起，治酷于禹。禹以老，徙为燕相。数岁，乱悖有罪,免归。后汤十余年，以寿卒于家。
和张汤一起制订法令的赵禹，中途一度曾被免了官，后来又做了廷尉。当初条侯周亚夫认为赵禹苛刻狠毒，不重用他。后来赵禹又做了少府，位同九卿。赵禹本来是严酷而又性急的，可是到了他的晚年，国家的案件越来越多，当时各级的官吏们都实行严刑峻法，而这时的赵禹反倒相对的宽和了，因此落了个判案公平的名声。王温舒等人都是后起的，办案都比赵禹严酷。赵禹因为年老，被调任燕国相。过了几年，因为昏聩而犯罪，被免官回家。在张汤死后十几年，赵禹寿终于家。
Zhao Yu was once dismissed from office but later became chief justice. The marquis of Tiao had given him no appointment because he considered him too ruthless, and when Zhao Yu later became privy treasurer with the rank of a high minister he did indeed prove extremely harsh. In his later years; when there was more litigation and most officials applied the utmost rigour of the law, Zhao Yu became more lenient and won a name for fairness. Law officers after him like Wang Wenshu were much harsher than Zhao Yu. In his old age he was transferred to be chief minister of Yan. A few years later he was dis- missed on a charge of improper conduct, and he died of old age at home more than ten years after Zhang Tang's death.

义纵者，河东人也。为少年时，尝与张次公俱攻剽为群盗。纵有姊姁,以医幸王太后。王太后问：“有子兄弟为官者乎?”姊曰：“有弟无行,不可。”太后乃告上，拜义姁弟纵为中郎，补上党郡中令。治敢行,少蕴藉,县无逋事,举为第一。迁为长陵及长安令,直法行治，不避贵戚。以捕案太后外孙修成君子仲，上以为能，迁为河内都尉。至则族灭其豪穰氏之属，河内道不拾遗。而张次公亦为郎，以勇悍从军，敢深入，有功，为岸头侯。
义纵是河东郡人。年轻的时候，曾经和张次公等一起劫道杀人。义纵的姐姐义姁，因为擅长医术受到王太后的宠信。王太后问她：“你有适合做官的儿子或兄弟吗?”义姁说：“有个弟弟行为不端，不能做官。”王太后就告诉武帝，让义姁的弟弟义纵当了中郎，后来又派到上党郡做了个县令。义纵敢说敢干，从不宽容，县里一切该办的事情没有一件拖拉，因此被推举为全郡第一。后来又先后调任长陵县和长安县的县令，他严格依法办事，对权贵外戚也从不通融。后来由于逮捕审判王太后的外孙修成君的儿子仲，被武帝认为能干，派他做了河内郡的都尉。义纵一到任就把当地的豪强穰氏等全部灭族，把河内郡治理得路不拾遗。当年与义纵为盗的张次公后来也做了郎官，接着又从军出战，由于作战勇敢，不怕深入敌后而立下战功，被封为岸头侯。
Yi Zong was a native of Hedong. As a young man he and Zhang Cigong lived as brigands. His elder sister Xu found favour with Empress Dowager Wang thanks to her knowledge of medicine. "Have you any sons or brothers in official posts?"the empress dowager asked her. "I have a younger brother, but he is not fit for any post," she replied. However, the empress dowager persuaded the emperor to make YiZong a palace guard and a magistrate in the province of Shangdang. He proved a firm, enterprising administrator and there was no tax evasion in his county, so that he was held up as an example to others. Promoted to be magistrate of Changling and then of Chang'an, he governed justly according to the law, not shrinking from clashes with nobles. His arrest and trial of Zhong, the son of Lady Xiucheng who was the empress dowager's grand-daughter, so impressed the emperor that he promoted Yi Zong to be military tribune of Henei. There he wiped out the powerful clan of Rang, and soon the people of Henei dared not pick up anything dropped in the road. Zhang Cigong also served as a palace guard. Being a fearless man he joined the army, advanced boldly into enemy territory and so distinguished himself that he was enfeoffed as marquis of Antou.

宁成家居,上欲以为郡守。御史大夫弘曰:“臣居山东为小吏时,宁成为济南都尉，其治如狼牧羊。成不可使治民。”上乃拜成为关都尉。岁余，关东吏隶郡国出入关者，号曰：“宁见乳虎，无值宁成之怒。”义纵自河内迁为南阳太守,闻宁成家居南阳,及纵至关，宁成侧行送迎,然纵气盛，弗为礼”。至郡，遂案宁氏，尽破碎其家。成坐有罪，及孔、暴之属皆奔亡,南阳吏民重足一迹。而平氏朱强、杜衍杜周为纵牙爪之吏,任用，迁为廷史。军数出定襄,定襄吏民乱败,于是徙纵为定襄太守。纵至，掩定襄狱中重罪轻系二百余人,及宾客昆弟私入相视亦二百余人。纵一捕鞠，曰“为死罪解脱”。是日皆报杀四百余人”。其后郡中不寒而栗，猾民佐吏为治。
宁成于武帝初年逃出长安后一直闲居在家，武帝打算起用他做郡太守，御史大夫公孙弘说：“我在山东做小吏的时候，宁成是济南郡的都尉，他治理百姓就像恶狼放羊一样。这样的人不能当地方官。”于是武帝就派宁成做了把守武关的都尉。过了一年多，在关东各郡各国任职而有事经常出入武关的官吏中便流传出一种说法：“宁愿碰见母老虎，也不愿碰见宁成发怒。”这时义纵已经从河内郡调任南阳郡守，义纵早就听说宁成家住南阳，等到义纵来到武关的时候，宁成恭恭敬敬地侧着身子迎来送去，而义纵那边却是趾高气扬，根本不还礼。义纵一到南阳郡，立刻把宁氏一族捉拿归案，搞得他们家破人亡。宁成本人也因牵连获罪，和孔氏、暴氏等一起逃亡了。南阳郡的官民们都被吓得动也不敢动。而平氏县的朱强和杜衍县的杜周倒成了义纵的心腹爪牙，大受重用，都被提拔做了廷史。这时由于汉军多次从定襄郡出发北伐匈奴，所以定襄的吏民屡受搅扰而一片混乱，于是朝廷就又调义纵去做了定襄太守。义纵一到任，就突然把定襄狱中关着的二百多个犯重罪而按犯轻罪关押的犯人和私自到狱中探视他们的兄弟、门客也有二百多人一齐抓了起来，说他们是“替刑犯私开刑具”,于是在一天之内把这四百多人通通上报处决了。从此一郡上下都吓得不寒而栗，昔日一贯豪猾为恶的人也都反过来帮着他们维持地方治安。
Ning Cheng was then living in retirement and the emperor wanted to make him the governor of a province, but the grand secretary Gongsun Hong objected. “When I served as a minor official east of the mountains, Ning Cheng was the military tribune of Jinan," he said. "He harried the people as a wolf harasses sheep.It would never do to let him govern a province. "So the emperor made Ning Cheng military tribune of the Hangu Pass. And a year or so later officers who had come through the Pass from provinces to the east declared, "Better to meet a tigress with cubs than face an angry Ning Cheng!” After Yi Zong was transferred from his post in Henei to be governor of Nanyang, he heard that Ning Cheng was living there in retirement. Ning Cheng came to welcome him humbly at the Pass, but Yi Zong behaved insolently and did not greet him. Upon reaching his post he put Ning Cheng on trial and destroyed his family. After Ning Cheng was convicted and men of the Kong and Bao families fled, the officers and citizens of Nanyang all took care to keep in step. Moreover Yi Zong used ZhuJiang of Pingshi and Du Zhou of Du Yan as his claws and teeth in applying the law, and appointed them as secretaries in the office of the chief justice. After several expeditions had marched through Dingxiang,the pro- vincial authorities and the people there were demoralized,and YiZong was transferred to govern the province.His first act upon arrival was to seize two hundred and more prisoners who were in the provincial gaol for heavy and light offences,along with more than two hundred friends and relatives who had slipped in without permission to see them.Accusing them all of conniving at the escape of criminals charged with capital offences,he had all four hundred and more of them ex- ecuted that same day.Then the men of that province trembled and those who were cunning began to help the officers in their tasks.

是时赵禹、张汤以深刻为九卿矣，然其治尚宽，辅法而行,而纵以鹰击毛挚为治。后会五铢钱白金起,民为奸,京师尤甚，乃以纵为右内史，王温舒为中尉。温舒至恶，其所为不先言纵，纵必以气凌之，败坏其功。其治，所诛杀甚多，然取为小治,奸益不胜，直指始出矣。吏之治以斩杀缚束为务,阎奉以恶用矣。纵廉，其治放郅都。上幸鼎湖，病久,已而卒起幸甘泉,道多不治。上怒曰：“纵以我为不复行此道乎?”嗛之。至冬，杨可方受告缗,纵以为此“乱民”,部吏捕其为可使者。天子闻，使杜式治，以为废格沮事，弃纵市。后一岁，张汤亦死。
这时赵禹、张汤都已经凭着执法严酷而官居九卿之列了，但相比之下他们的办案还算宽缓，总还要找点法律依据，而义纵纯粹是靠着像苍鹰猛虎一样穷凶极恶。后来赶上朝廷推行五铢钱和使用白金，有些人制造假钱，都城长安尤其严重，于是武帝便任命义纵为右内吏，任命王温舒为中尉。王温舒极为凶恶，他想做什么事情，事先都不向义纵打招呼，而义纵也找茬欺凌他，破坏他的计划。义纵办事，靠的是杀人多，结果只能取得一些暂时的安定，实际上作奸犯科的人越来越多，于是朝廷开始派出绣衣直指使者到各地去专门缉捕盗寇。这时整治社会秩序实际上就是靠着抓人杀人，于是阎奉就因为手段毒辣而受到了重用。义纵为人廉洁，整治社会的办法是学习郅都。武帝巡幸鼎湖，在那里病了很久，病好后突然往赴甘泉宫，发现道路没有修好，武帝生气地说：“义纵以为我好不了，不会再走这条道了吗?”从而暗记在心。到了这年冬天，杨可倡导实行告发申报资产不实的“告缗法”,义纵认为这些告缗的人都是乱民，因而派出狱吏抓捕了一些为杨可效力的人。武帝听说这事，就派杜式来察问义纵，结果给义纵加了个抗拒皇帝诏命的罪名，将其杀头了。张汤则死在义纵死的第二年。
By this time Zhao Yu and Zhang Tang had become high officials through their harsh application of the law, yet they were lenient com- pared with YiZong and they acted in accordance with the law, whereas he enforced his rule like a hawk swooping down on its prey. Later the debasing of the coinage gave rise to malpractices among the people, particularly in the capital. So Yi Zong was appointed the senior prefect of the capital with Wang Wenshu as metropolitan tribune. Wang Wenshu was quite merciless. But if he took action without first consulting YiZong, the latter would abuse and discredit him. Yi Zong in his term of office executed a whole host of people yet failed to establish good order, for lawlessness only increased and special con- stables had to be appointed. Their main task was to carry out executions and arrests, and Yan Feng was employed because of his cruel nature. Yi Zong was incorruptible, modelling his administration on that of Zhi Du. The emperor fell ill while visiting Dinghu and remained there for some time. When at last he recovered and made a trip to Ganquan, he was angry to find the road in poor repair and exclaimed indignantly, Yi Zong must have thought I would never pass this way again!” That winter Yang Ke was given the task of collecting evidence of tax evasion and, fearing this would lead to public unrest, Yi Zong told his officers to arrest Yang Ke's agents. When the emperor heard of this he ordered Du Shi to investigate the matter. Yi Zong was convicted of obstructing state policy and executed in the marketplace. Zhang Tang died the following year.

王温舒者，阳陵人也。少时椎埋为奸。已而试补县亭长，数废。为吏，以治狱至廷史。事张汤,迁为御史。督盗贼，杀伤甚多，稍迁至广平都尉。择郡中豪敢任吏十余人,以为爪牙，皆把其阴重罪，而纵使督盗贼,快其意所欲得。此人虽有百罪，弗法;即有避，因其事夷之四，亦灭宗。以其故齐赵之郊盗贼不敢近广平,广平声为道不拾遗。上闻，迁为河内太守。
王温舒是阳陵县人。年轻时当过盗墓贼。后来在本县当亭长，中间曾几次被罢免过。后来做了执法小吏，因善于断案而升任廷史，从此到张汤手下任职。后来王温舒又升为御史，负责缉捕盗贼，这其间杀死杀伤过许多人，后来升迁到了广平郡都尉。到任后他挑了郡里十几个胆大敢干的衙役做自己的心腹爪牙，他掌握着这伙人的未被揭发的大罪，而派他们出去缉捕别的盗贼，于是他想抓谁总能称心如意地抓到。他用的这些爪牙即使有一百条罪状，他也不办他们，如果谁要是有所避忌不尽心干，王温舒就立即找个理由把他和他的家族一齐灭掉。由于他使用了这套办法，因而使得齐国、赵国这一带的盗贼都不敢靠近广平郡，于是广平郡就以路不拾遗闻名了。武帝听说后，提升王温舒做了河内太守。
Wang Wenshu was a native of Yangling who in his youth robbed graves and broke the law. He was made a constable in his county and, although dismissed several times, subsequenly became an officer of the law and a secretary in the office of the chief justice under Zhang Tang. Transferred to be a censor in charge of suppressing brigandage, he had a great number of people executed. Then he became military tribune of Guangping and chose more than ten able men of that province as his henchmen, keeping them under his thumb with evidence of their secret crimes while he used them to control thieves and brigands.So long as they fell in with his wishes, Wang would not punish them even if they were guilty of a hundred crimes.But once a man went against his wishes, he charged him with his past crimes and had him executed with all his clan. As a result,no brigand in the region of Qi and Zhao dared come near Guangping, and it became known as a district in which no one picked up anything dropped in the road. When the emperor heard of this he promoted Wang to be governer of Henei.

素居广平时，皆知河内豪奸之家，及往，九月而至。令郡具私马五十匹，为驿自河内至长安。部吏如居广平时方略，捕郡中豪猾，郡中豪猾相连坐千余家。上书请,大者至族，小者乃死，家尽没入偿臧。奏行不过二三日，得可事。论报,至流血十余里。河内皆怪其奏，以为神速。尽十二月,郡中毋声，毋敢夜行，野无犬吠之盗。其颇不得，失之旁郡国,黎来，会春,温舒顿足叹曰：“嗟乎，令冬月益展一月，足吾事矣!”其好杀伐行威不爱人如此。天子闻之，以为能，迁为中尉。其治复放河内，徙诸名祸猾吏与从事,河内则杨皆、麻戊，关中杨赣、成信等。义纵为内史，惮未敢恣治。及纵死，张汤败后，徙为廷尉，而尹齐为中尉。
王温舒早在广平郡任职时，就知道河内有哪些豪强奸邪之家。王温舒是九月到达河内的，王温舒一到就让郡里为他个人准备五十匹马，在河内到长安的大路上他建立了若干驿站。他部署使用衙役的办法与在广平郡时的样子相同，他捕捉郡中那些豪强奸猾之徒，并由此牵连而及罪的多达上千家。只要他向上面一呈报，那就必然是重者灭族，轻者本人处死，家产全部没收抵偿赃款。他的每次呈报公文总是不过两三天就能得到批示，而后一处决罪犯就是血流十几里。全郡都奇怪他的上报下批为什么这么神速。到十二月的月底，郡城里鸦雀无声，谁也不敢在夜里出来行走，四野乡村连个引起狗叫的小贼也没有。个别逃到临近郡县和诸侯国里去的人，待至把他们抓回来时，已经到了停止行刑的春天了，气得王温舒跺着脚叹息说：“唉哟，要是能让冬季再多上一个月，我的事就办完了!”他就是这样嗜杀成性，为了显示威风而不惜人命。但是武帝听说后，认为他能干，于是便提拔他做了中尉。到了京城王温舒还是采取在河内曾用过的那套办法，又找了一群奸诈刻毒的衙役来帮他办事，从河内带过来的有杨皆、麻戊，从关中新找的有杨赣、成信等人。早在义纵做内史的时候，王温舒因为怕他，还不敢放手大干。等到义纵被杀、张汤垮台之后，王温舒便升任了廷尉，而尹齐接替做了中尉。
While still in Guangping Wang Wenshu had learned which of the powerful families of Henei had committed crimes. When he reached his new post in the ninth month, he ordered the provincial office to requisition fifty horses to use as post horses between Henei and the capital and made his subordinates act just as in Guangping, arresting all evil-doers of any prominence in the province, More than one thou- sand families were involved. He drew up a memorial to the throne asking that the major offenders should have their clans wiped out, and that the lesser offenders should be executed and have their property confiscated by the public treasury. Only two or three days after dis- patching this memorial he received the emperor's approval. He took action at once, and more than ten liof land was drenched with blood. The whole of Henei marvelled at the speed with which this was done. By the twelfth month not a voice was raised in the province, not a man dared walk abroad at night, there was not a bandit in the countryside to set dogs barking. And the few who escaped to neighbouring provinces and principalities were hounded by his men. When spring came, Wang Wenshu stamped his foot and sighed. "If only the winter had lasted one month longer,I could have finished off the job,"he said. Such was his delight in killing men and demonstrating his might and ruthlessness. The emperor, learning of this, considered Wang Wenshu able and promoted him to be the metropolitan tribune where he acted as in Henei. He enlisted as his subordinates the officers noted for cruelty and cunning, men like YangJie and Ma Wu of Henei and Yang Gan and Cheng Xin of Guanzhong. So long as Yi Zong was city prefect, Wang Wenshu did not dare go too far. But after Yi Zong's death and Zhang Tang's fall, Wang Wenshu was made chief justice with Yin Qias the metropolitan tribune.

尹齐者，东郡在平人,以刀笔稍迁至御史。事张汤，张汤数称以为廉武，使督盗贼，所斩伐不避贵戚。迁为关都尉,声甚于宁成。上以为能,迁为中尉，吏民益凋敝。尹齐木强少文,豪恶吏伏匿而善吏不能为治,以故事多废，抵罪。上复徙温舒为中尉,而杨仆以严酷为主爵都尉。
尹齐是东郡在平县人。从一个刀笔小吏而逐步升迁成了御史。他曾在张汤手下做事，张汤曾多次称赞他廉洁果敢，便派他缉捕盗贼。尹齐办案即使碰到达官贵人也绝不放过。后来升为关都尉，严酷的名声比宁成还厉害。武帝认为他能干，提拔他做中尉，从此关中的吏民们越来越受不了了。尹齐头脑僵硬而缺乏文才，一些凶狠狡猾的衙役都躲了起来，而那些老实的人又办不成什么事，因此许多事情被耽误了，尹齐也因此而受了处置。武帝无法只好又调王温舒来做中尉，而让办事严酷的杨仆做了主爵都尉。
Yin Qiwas a native of Shiping in Dongjun.He started his career as a clerk, then became a censor working under Zhang Tang, who on several occasions commended his integrity and courage and put him in charge of suppressing brigands. In executing and punishing men, he did not spare nobles. Promoted to be military tribune within the Pass, he won greater fame than Ning Cheng. The emperor, impressed by his ability, appointed him as the metropolitan tribune. Then officers and citizens alike had an even harder time. Yin Qi was blunt and lacking in refinement. Powerful and harsh officials tried to keep out of his way, while the good officials could not work with him. Thus he failed in many undertakings and was punished. The emperor transferred Wang Wenshu back to the post of metropolitan tribune and made Yang Pu, known for his severity, the officer in charge of the principalities.

杨仆者，宜阳人也,以千夫为吏。河南守案举以为能,迁为御史，使督盗贼关东。治放尹齐，以为敢挚行,稍迁至主爵都尉，列九卿。天子以为能。南越反,拜为楼船将军，有功，封将梁侯。为荀彘所缚。居久之，病死。
杨仆是宜阳人。因为他有“千夫”的武功爵而被选用进了官府。河南太守经过考察认为他能干，于是杨仆被任为御史，朝廷派他到关东缉捕盗贼。杨仆的办事方法是学习尹齐，以勇猛敢干著称。渐渐地升到了主爵都尉，享受到了九卿的待遇。武帝也认为他能干，南越反汉时，杨仆被拜为楼船将军，由于征讨有功，被封为将梁侯。后来与左将军荀彘征朝鲜时被袭捕。又过了些年，因病而死。
Yang Pu was a native of Yiyang who started his official career as an officer commanding a thousand men. The governor of Henan recommended him and he was promoted to the post of a censor in charge of bandit suppression east of the Pass. He adopted the bold, ruthless tactics of Yin Qi. Before long he was promoted to be the officer in charge of the principalities, ranking as one of the nine chief ministers. The emperor thought highly of his ability and, when the Nanyue rebelled, made him General of the Tiered Galleys. He distinguished himself in this campaign and was enfeoffed as the marquis of Jiangliang. But he was subsequently arrested by Xun Zhi, and some time later he died of illness.

而温舒复为中尉。为人少文，居它悟悟不辩,至于中尉则心开。督盗贼，素习关中俗，知豪恶吏，豪恶吏尽复为用，为方略。吏苛察，盗贼恶少年投购告言奸,置伯格长以牧司奸盗贼。温舒为人谄，善事有势者；即无势者，视之如奴。有势家，虽有奸如山，弗犯；无势者，贵戚必侵辱。舞文巧诋下户之猾，以煮大豪。其治中尉如此。奸猾穷治，大抵尽靡烂狱中,行论无出者。其爪牙吏虎而冠”。于是中尉部中中猾以下皆伏,有势者为游声誉,称治。治数岁，其吏多以权富。
王温舒二次做了中尉，这个人缺少文才，他一任别的官职就昏昏沉沉不辨是非，而一当中尉，立刻就心花怒放办事精明了。他负责缉捕盗贼，由于他一向熟悉关中的风俗，知道哪些衙役凶残狡诈，于是这些凶残狡诈的家伙们就都尽心为他效力，替他出谋划策。这些人苛刻狠毒，他们设置了许多揭发检举箱，鼓励人们揭发检举，又在各路设置“伯格长”让他们来监督那些作奸犯科的人。王温舒喜欢吹吹拍拍，对有权势的人极力巴结；对于没有权势的人，就把他们看同奴仆。权势大的人家，即使作恶如山，他也不去触犯；没有权势的人家，即使是金枝玉叶他也敢于欺侮。他通过舞文弄法整治小户人家来向那些豪强大奸提出警告，他做中尉时就是这么干的。对那些奸滑之徒他是一追到底的，只要抓起来差不多就得全部死在狱中，没有一个判过刑的能活着出来。他的那些爪牙们都像是戴着帽子的老虎。于是在他中尉府管辖的地面上中等以下程度的不轨分子都老老实实了；再加上一些有权有势的人替他说好，于是他的中尉治下很快就落了个太平无事的美称。一连几年过去了，他手下的衙役们许多都靠着手中的权力而富了起来。
Then Wang Wenshu again served as metropolitan tribune. Lacking refinement, at court he appeared dull and stupid, but as military tribune he was in his element. He suppressed brigands and thieves, understood the way of the people within the Pass,knew which were the ablest and most cunning and employed them as his officers to keep a close watch for robbers, thieves and young men of bad character. He offered re- wards for informing on evil-doers through special letter boxes, and posted officers in the villages to look out for brigands. Wang Wenshu was a sycophant who flattered those with power and treated the lowly like slaves. A powerful family might be guilty of a host of crimes, yet he would do nothing, whereas he would bully a family without influence even if it was a noble one. He skilfully manipulated the law to destroy petty rogues so as to bring pressure to bear on great families. This was his way as military tribune of the capital. He carried out such exhaustive investigations that most of those accused died in prison; few were released. His henchmen were tigers in uniform. So all the lesser rogues in there region under his jurisdiction were subdued, while the powerful spread his fame as an able administrator. After several years of his administration most of his subordinates had grown rich by taking advantage of their position.

温舒击东越还,议有不中意者,坐小法抵罪免。是时天子方欲作通天台而未有人,温舒请覆中尉脱卒,得数万人作。上说，拜为少府。徙为右内史，治如其故，奸邪少禁。坐法失官。复为右辅,行中尉事，如故操。
王温舒征讨东越归来后，因为发表了一些不合武帝心意的议论，被加了一些小罪名罢了官。这时汉武帝为求神仙想修通天台而没有人力，于是王温舒建议清查中尉管辖范围内的逃避劳役的人，结果一下子查出了几万人。武帝很高兴，又让王温舒做了少府。后来又调任右内史，他还是使用他过去那套老办法，为非作歹的人稍微有些收敛。此后他又因触犯法律丢了官。不久又做了右辅都尉，并代行中尉的职权，做法还是像过去一样。
After Wang Wenshu's return from the expedition against Dongyue, the emperor was displeased with something he said find punished and dismissed him for some trifling offence. The emperor at this time was planning to build the Tower Reaching to Heaven, but no workmen were available. Wang Wenshu suggested using all the men who had evaded conscript duty under the jurisdiction of the metropolitan tribune, and by this means succeeded in getting several tens of thousands of workers. The emperor was pleased and made him privy treasurer and later senior metropolitan prefect. By employing his previous methods, he was able to put a certain check to crime. Subsequently he lost this post for some offence, but was later made the prefect of West Chang'an with the powers of a metropolitan tribune. He carried out his duties in this post as before.

岁余，会宛军发,诏征豪吏，温舒匿其吏华成，及人有变告温舒受员骑钱,他奸利事,罪至族，自杀。其时两弟及两婚家亦各自坐他罪而族。光禄徐自为曰:“悲夫，夫古有三族,而王温舒罪至同时而五族乎?”
过了一年多，汉朝发兵西征大宛，武帝下令征召那些强悍有过失的衙役们入伍，王温舒掩护留下了他手下的衙役华成。后来有人告发王温舒接受在册骑兵的贿赂，还有其他作奸犯科的事，罪当灭族，王温舒自杀了。与此同时，王温舒的两个弟弟和弟媳的娘家也分别因为别的罪而被灭族了。光禄勋徐自为说：“可悲啊，自古只有灭三族的罪，而王温舒竞至同时被灭了五族!”
A year or so later, just before the dispatch of the expedition to Feraxanase powerful officers were summoned to take part in the campaign but Wang Wenshu concealed his lieutenant Hua Cheng. Later someone informed against him, accusing him of taking bribes and making illegal profits. Condemned to execution with his clan,he com- mitted suicide. At the same time the families of his two brothers and brothers-in-law were also exterminated for other crimes. The superintendent of the imperial household Xu Ziwei remarked, “Alas! In ancient times three classes of relatives were sometimes wiped out, but now Wang Wenshu has been punished by the destruction of five."

温舒死，家直累千金。后数岁，尹齐亦以淮阳都尉病死,家直不满五十金。所诛灭淮阳甚多，及死，仇家欲烧其尸，尸亡去归葬。
王温舒死后，家产总值上千金。过了几年，尹齐也病死在淮阳都尉任上，虽然他的家产还不满五十金，但由于他在淮阳杀了许多人，所以当他一死那些仇家们便想将他焚尸扬灰，他的家人扬言尸体不翼而飞，实际上是偷偷地运回家乡安葬了。
At the time of Wang Wenshu's death his family had a thousand pieces of gold. A few years later, when Yin Qi died while military tribune of Huaiyang, his estate was less than fifty pieces of gold. He had killed so many citizens of Huaiyang that his enemies wanted to burn his corpse, but it was taken secretly to his old home and buried.

自温舒等以恶为治，而郡守、都尉、诸侯二千石欲为治者,其治大抵尽放温舒，而吏民益轻犯法，盗贼滋起。南阳有梅免、白政，楚有殷中、杜少，齐有徐勃，燕赵之间有坚卢、范生之属。大群至数千人，擅自号,攻城邑，取库兵,释死罪，缚辱郡太守、都尉，杀二千石，为檄告县趣具食;小群以百数，掠卤乡里者，不可胜数也。于是天子始使御史中丞、丞相长史督之,犹弗能禁也。乃使光禄大夫范昆、诸辅都尉及故九卿张德等衣绣衣,持节，虎符发兵以兴击,斩首大部或至万余级,及以法诛通饮食,坐连诸郡,甚者数千人。数岁，乃颇得其渠率;散卒失亡，复聚党阻山川者,往往而群居。无可奈何，于是作“沉命法”,曰群盗起不发觉,发觉而捕弗满品者,二千石以下至小吏主者皆死。其后小吏畏诛，虽有盗不敢发，恐不能得，坐课累府”;府亦使其不言，故盗贼寖多，上下相为匿，以文辞避法焉。
自从王温舒等采用凶恶狠毒的手段维持治安以来，那些郡太守、都尉，以及诸侯国的二千石一级的官僚凡想搞出点政绩来的，大体上都是仿效王温舒的做法，其结果反而是官吏和百姓们犯法的越来越多，盗贼也越来越多了。南阳郡有梅免、白政，楚地有殷中、杜少，齐地有徐勃，燕赵地区有坚卢、范生等人。他们大股的聚众几千人，称王称霸，进攻城镇，夺取武库里的兵器，释放监狱里的犯人，捆绑侮辱郡太守、都尉，杀害二千石的大官，他们公然给一些县下命令让给他们给自己准备粮食；至于那些人数上百的小股土匪在各个乡村流窜掠夺的就无法统计了。于是武帝开始派御史中丞、丞相长史等下去督促缉捕，结果还是禁不住。于是武帝又派光禄大夫范昆和三辅的各个都尉以及曾经做过九卿的张德等人，让他们穿着特制的绣衣，手持皇帝给的符节，并让他们手执虎符可以随时以特别任务为名调派军队去征讨盗贼，有的在镇压一股盗贼时就杀上万的人。再处置那些给盗贼供应过吃喝的人，有时也往往牵连到不少郡县，有的一起也有几千人被杀。有的一连过了好几年，才抓获到一些头目。至于那些被打散的喽罗逃入深山险水结帮成群啸聚一起的，官府也没有什么办法了。于是国家又制订了“沉命法”,规定凡是成群结伙的强贼出现而没有及时发觉，或是发觉后没有捕获到一定限额的，负责此事的官员上至二千石下至小衙役都要处死。从此小衙役们由于怕死，便虽有盗贼也不敢报告了。又因为听到报告也怕抓不住，这样不但下头受罚还要牵累到上头，所以上头也就让下头不要说。于是盗贼就越来越多，上司和下属互相隐瞒，大家都作出一些官样文章来逃避法律责任。
Since Wang Wenshu and these others governed with such cruelty, most provincial governors, local tribunes and officers of the two thou- sand piculs rank who wanted to govern effectively copied their ways. Then officers and citizens alike thought nothing of breaking the law, while the number of brigands increased—men like Mei Mian and Bai Zheng in Nanyang, in Zhong and Du Shao in Chu, Xu Bo in Qi, and Jian Lu and Fan Sheng in the region between Yan and Zhao. The larger bands,numbering several thousand men, assumed titles, attacked cities and towns, seized weapons from the arsenals, released condemned prisoners, bound and insulted provincial governors and local tribunes, killed high officials of the two thousand piculs rank, and ordered the counties to supply them with food. The smaller bands of several hundred men which plundered innumerable villages were past counting. The emperor ordered the chief officers under the prime minister and the censor to restore order, but they could not put an end to brigandage. Then the emperor sent out Fan Kun,superintendent of the imperial household, the prefects of the capital, the former minister Zhang De and others. Clad in embroidered robes, bearing the imperial credentials and tiger tallies, they mobilized forces to attack the bandits and killed large numbers of them, sometimes more than ten thousand at a time. Those who had supplied them with food were also punished, and in some cases this involved thousands of people in the provinces. After several years most of the chief bandits had been caught and the rest had scattered and fled. But they gathered behind the defences of mountains and rivers, and the authorities were powerless against them. Then a law against harbouring outlaws was promulgated. This decreed that if any officer failed to discover an outbreak of banditry, or having discovered one failed to arrest the chief culprits,everyone responsible would be put to death from officers of the two thousand piculs rank down to petty clerks. This so intimidated the lesser officials that they dared not report the presence of brigands for fear they might be unable to capture them. And as high officials were held responsible for the lower, they instructed the latter to hush up such cases. So although the country swarmed with more and more brigands, officials high and low concealed this fact, sending in false reports to keep out of trouble.

减宣者，杨人也。以佐史无害给事河东守府。卫将军青使买马河东,见宣无害，言上，征为大厩丞。官事辨,稍迁至御史及中丞。使治主父偃及治淮南反狱,所以微文深诋,杀者甚众,称为敢决疑。数废数起，为御史及中丞者几二十岁。王温舒免中尉，而宣为左内史。其治米盐,事大小皆关其手。自部署县名曹实物,官吏令丞不得擅摇，痛以重法绳之。居官数年，一切郡中为小治辨，然独宣以小致大,能因力行之，难以为经。中废，为右扶风,坐怨成信，信亡藏上林中。宣使郿令格杀信，吏卒格信时，射中上林苑门。宣下吏诋罪，以为大逆,当族，自杀。而杜周任用。
减宣是杨县人。因为在县里做佐史干得好而被提拔到河东郡里供职。有一次大将军卫青到河东买马，见减宣办事利索，就向武帝作了推荐，于是减宣被上调做了大厩丞。又由于他把大厩丞份内的事办得好，因而渐渐地升到了御史和御史中丞。武帝派他审理主父偃和淮南王谋反的两个案子，他深抠条文，严加重判，杀了许多人，于是被称赞为能断疑案。此后曾几次被罢又几次再起，前后任御史及御史中丞将近二十年。王温舒被免去中尉的时候，减宣任左内史。他处理政务非常琐碎，无论大事小事，都要他亲自决定。甚至他要亲自部署下属各县各科的事务，他规定的东西，府里的官吏和下属的县令县丞都不得擅自改变，不听话的就从重惩处。在他任职的几年，其他郡里都只是小有成效，唯独减宣，用小力而成大功。但他的这种做法也难以普遍推行。后来减宣被废，接着又起来做了右扶风。后来因为他与下属成信有怨隙，成信潜逃藏在了上林苑，减宣便派郿县的县令带人去上林苑击杀成信，结果吏卒们在射杀成信时，射在了上林苑的门上，于是减宣被下狱，并被宣判为大逆不道，应当灭族，于是减宣自杀了。这以后杜周受到了信用。
Jian Xuan was a native of Yang. Known for his competence as a clerk, he was employed by the governor of Hedong. And when Marshal Wei Qing was sent to Hedong to buy horses he was so struck by Jian Xuan's ability that he recommended him to the emperor, who appointed him officer of the imperial stables. Proving competent, he was promoted to the post of law officer and that of censor. And he was in charge of the prosecution of Zhufu Yan and those who had rebelled with the prince of Huainan. He kept to the letter of the law, brought serious charges, was responsible for many executions, and won a name for his bold handling of difficult cases. He was dismissed several times but always reinstated, and he served as law officer and cenor for nearly twenty years. After Wang Wenshu's dismissal from the post of military tribune of the capital, Jian Xuan became the junior metropolitan prefect. A meticulous administrator, he kept all matters, large and small, in his own hands and personally supervised all the officers in the counties and stores under his jurisdiction. No official might modify his orders on pain of severe punishment. After he had held office for several years, all the affairs in that region were well ordered; but his insistence on looking into every detail taxed his strength, and he could not keep this up indefinitely. He was later demoted to be prefect of the western district of the capital. Jian Xuan hated Cheng Xin, who fled to Shanglin Park, and he ordered the magistrate of Mei to pursue and kill him.While the magistrate's troops were attacking Cheng Xin, one of their arrows struck the gate of the imperial park and Jian Xuan was charged with this offence, which ranked as high treason, and sentenced to execution with all his clan. He committed suicide and Du Zhou succeeded to his post.

杜周者，南阳杜衍人。义纵为南阳守，以为爪牙，举为廷尉史，事张汤。汤数言其无害，至御史。使案边失亡,所论杀甚众。奏事中上意，任用，与减宣相编,更为中丞十余岁。
杜周是南阳郡杜衍县人。义纵做南阳太守的时候，把他当作心腹爪牙。后来被推荐做了廷尉史，在张汤手下效力。张汤多次向武帝称赞他能干，于是被提拔为御史。武帝派他去处置边境郡县在敌人进攻下损失兵力与物资财产的问题，被他判罪杀掉的人很多。回报时符合武帝的心意，因而受到信用，他和减宣交叉轮流着做了十几年御史中丞。
Du Zhou was a native of Duyan in Nanyang. When YiZong was governor of Nanyang Du Zhou was a henchman of his. He was then promoted to be a secretary of the chief justice, Zhang Tang, who gave such good reports of him to the emperor that he was made a censor. Ordered to investigate cases of flight from border districts, he had a great many people condemned to death. Since his memorials pleased the emperor, he was trusted as much as Jian Xuan. For more than ten years he served as the law officer in the censor's office.

其治与宣相放，然重迟,外宽，内深次骨。宣为左内史，周为廷尉,其治大放张汤而善候伺。上所欲挤者，因而陷之；上所欲释者，久系待问而微见其冤状。客有让周曰：“君为天子决平，不循三尺法,专以人主意指为狱。狱者固如是乎?”周曰：“三尺安出哉?前主所是著为律，后主所是疏为令。当时为是，何古之法乎?”
杜周的办事与减宣相仿，但较为持重，表面上宽厚，内心里苛刻到了极点。减宣做左内史的时候，杜周做廷尉，办事手段学习张汤，而且善于猜测迎合武帝的心意。武帝想排挤谁，他就编造罪名陷害谁；武帝想宽释谁，他就故意关着谁等候武帝问及，并寻机略微透露一些此人被冤的情况。有人责问杜周说：“你替天子断案，不以法律为根据，而专门看着皇上的脸色行事，能够这样断案么?”杜周说：“法律是怎么订出来的?前代皇帝订出来的就是法律；当今皇帝点头的就是命令，当时怎么说就怎么对，何必非得遵行古法呢?”
Du Zhou's administration was like that of Jian Xuan, but while outwardly lenient he was in fact quite ruthless. When Jian Xuan was the junior city prefect, DuZhou served as chief justice. He pursued a policy similar to that of Zhang Tang,and was also skilled in anticipating the emperor’s wishes. If the emperor wanted to get rid of someone'd Zhou would ruin the man; if the emperor wanted to spare someone, Du Zhou would use delaying tactics and try to prove that the charge was unfounded. One of his guests reproached him for this, saying, “You are dispensing justice for the Son of Heaven, but instead of following the legal statutes you pass sentence according to your sovereign's wishes. Is this proper behaviour for a judge?” “Where did those statutes originate?” Du Zhou retorted. "The legal codes were laid down by earlier sovereigns, the enacting clauses by their successors. Anything that suits the present time is right—what need have we for ancient laws?”

至周为廷尉，诏狱亦益多矣。二千石系者新故相因,不减百余人。郡吏大府举之廷尉,一岁至千余章。章大者连逮证案数百,小者数十人；远者数千，近者数百里。会狱,吏因责如章告劾,不服，以笞掠定之。于是闻有逮皆亡匿。狱久者至更数赦十有余岁而相告言,大抵尽诋以不道以上。廷尉及中都官诏狱逮至六七万人四，吏所增加十万余人。
等到杜周做廷尉的时候，奉旨审理的案件就越发多了。二千石一级的大官被下狱的一茬压一茬，人数上百。各郡国与宰相衙门送交廷尉审理的案件，一年多达一千多件。大的案件要牵连逮捕几百人，小的也有几十人；远的从几千里以外押解进京，近的也有几百里。一到审判的时候，法官就逼着犯人按照被告发的罪名承认，如果不服，就通过严刑拷打直到承认为止。因此人们一听到被抓就立刻逃亡了。有的案子中间都经过几次大赦，前后拖了十几年还在揭发举报，大多数最后都定成大逆不道而向上呈报。廷尉和中都官两处的监狱里关押的犯人多达六七万，两处的衙役竟增加了十万多人。
While Du Zhou was chief justice even more officials were condemned to imprisonment by the emperor, and there were usually more than a hundred officials of the two thousand piculs rank in prison. Every year more than a thousand indictments were referred to the chief justice from governors and high officials of the provinces, the graver cases involving several hundred men, the minor ones several dozens. Accused men came to the capital from several hundred or several thousand li away. When a case was tried, those who denied the charges brought against them were beaten until they confessed. So all who heard that they might be arrested immediately went into hiding, sometimes for ten years, even though several amnesties were mean- while pronounced. Most of the indictments were for immoral con- duct or more serious crimes. Those arrested and imprisoned by imperial decree numbered sixty or seventy thousand, those arrested and imprisoned by the officials more than a hundred thousand.

周中废，后为执金吾,逐盗，捕治桑弘羊、卫皇后昆弟子刻深,天子以为尽力无私，迁为御史大夫。家两子，夹河为守。其治暴酷皆甚于王温舒等矣。杜周初征为廷史，有一马，且不全；及身久任事，至三公列，子孙尊官，家訾累数巨万矣。
杜周后来曾中途被罢官，后来当了执金吾，负责追捕盗贼。在逮捕审理桑弘羊与卫皇后的兄弟子侄时，由于执法严酷，被武帝认为是尽心尽职，没有私心，因而提升为御史大夫。杜周有两个儿子，分别任河南与河内两郡的太守，其办事的暴虐严酷都比王温舒还要厉害。杜周开始被调任廷尉史的时候，只有一匹马，连鞍辔都不齐全；后来由于长期为官，位至三公，子孙也做了高官，这时他的家产可以多达几万万。
Later Du Zhou was dismissed from the post of chief justice and appointed as military tribune of the capital. He arrested and dealt with brigands and investigated the cases of Sang Hongyang and the brothers of Empress Wei. He was severe in his judgements and the emperor, impressed by his energy and impartiality, raised him to the position of grand secretary. His two sons served as provincial governors on both sides of the Yellow River and proved even harsher and more tyrannical than Wang Wenshu and the rest. When Du Zhou was first appointed as a secretary under the chief justice, he owned only one horse,and that not fully equipped. After holding office for many years, however, he rose to be one of the three chief ministers, all his sons and grandsons had become high officials and his family estate was worth millions of cash.

太史公曰：自郅都、杜周十人者,此皆以酷烈为声。然郅都伉直,引是非，争天下大体。张汤以知阴阳，人主与俱上下,时数辩当否,国家赖其便。赵禹时据法守正。杜周从谀,以少言为重。自张汤死后，网密，多诋严,官事寖以秏废。九卿碌碌奉其官，救过不赡，何暇论绳墨之外乎?然此十人中，其廉者足以为仪表，其污者足以为戒,方略教导,禁奸止邪，一切亦皆彬彬质有其文武焉。虽惨酷，斯称其位矣。至若蜀守冯当暴挫,广汉李贞擅磔人，东郡弥仆锯项,天水骆璧推咸，河东褚广妄杀四，京兆无忌、冯翊殷周蝮鸷,水衡阎奉朴击卖请,何足数哉"!何足数哉!
太史公说：从郅都到杜周这十个人，都有酷烈的名声。然而郅都刚正廉直，他争论的是非，都关系到国家大计。张汤善于窥察皇帝的心思，总是照皇帝的意思发表意见，但有时也能阐明一些问题的是非，使国家得到一些好处。赵禹有时能依法办事，坚持公正。杜周则纯粹是看风使舵以少说话来表现自己的稳重。自从张汤死后，法网越来越密，诋毁诬告的事情越来越多，而国家的事情则越来越没人管。九卿大臣保官保命地混日子，连自救都怕来不及，谁还顾得上去管那些层次更高的问题呢!在这十个人中，虽然有的廉洁能作为人的表率，有的贪赃枉法足以引为鉴戒，但他们在治民办事，在惩处坏人上，都还能做得礼法结合，头头是道。虽然执法严酷，但还都算得上是称职的人。至于像蜀郡太守冯当那样地摧残百姓，像广汉太守李贞那样把人碎尸，像东郡太守弥仆那样用锯锯人的脖子，像天水太守骆璧那样靠刑讯逼供定案，以及像河东郡太守褚广那样的滥杀无辜，像京兆尹无忌、左冯翊殷周那样像毒蛇苍鹰一样的狠毒，像水衡都尉阎奉那样的严刑逼供勒索，就更不值得一提!不值得一提啦!
The Grand Historian comments: These ten men from Zhi Du to Du Zhou were all known for their harshness. Zhi Du was honest and upright, guided by principles in dealing with important questions. Zhang Tang was always well informed and he and the emperor thought alike; many of his proposals were of benefit to the state. Zhao Yu usually upheld justice and abided by the law. Du Zhou was eager to please the emperor and tried to win favour by speaking as little as possible. After Zhang Tang's death the law became more involved and punishments more severe, so that the regular government work was gradually neglected. High ministers gave all their efforts to keeping their posts and tried so hard to avoid mistakes that they had no time to do more than obey the law. The virtues of these ten men can be taken as models, their defects as a warning. Their measures and instructions were designed to curb evil and, taken in the aggregate, were of significance as regards both their civil and military aspects.Although cruel and harsh, these men did what their duty prescribed. But when it comes to officials like Feng Dang, the governor of Shu, who savagely oppressed people; Li Zhen, the governor of Guanghan, who made mincemeat of men; Mi Pu, the governor of Dongjun, who sawed off people's heads; Luo Bi, the governor of Tianshui, who tortured people until they confessed; Chu Guang, the governor of Hedong, who killed men wantonly; Wuji, the prefect of the capital, and Yin Zhou of Fengyi who were as ruthless as vipers and vultures; and Yan Feng the privy treasurer who beat up men to extort money from them—their careers are not worth recording.
