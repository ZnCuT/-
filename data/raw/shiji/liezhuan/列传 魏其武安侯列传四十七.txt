魏其侯窦婴者，孝文后从兄子也。父世观津人。喜宾客。孝文时，婴为吴相,病免。孝景初即位，为詹事。
魏其侯窦婴，是孝文帝窦皇后堂兄的儿子。从他的父亲以上，世世代代都住在观津。窦婴喜欢结交宾客。孝文帝在位时，窦婴做过吴国丞相，后来因为有病免官，孝景帝刚即位时，窦婴又被任命为詹事。
Dou Ying, the marquis of Weiqi, was the son ofacousin of Empress Dou. Until his father's time his family had lived in Guanjin. He had many protegés. In the reign of Emperor Wen, Dou Ying served as chief minister of Wu but had to give up this post because of illness. When Emperor Jing came to the throne, he served as steward in the household of the empress.

梁孝王者,孝景弟也，其母窦太后爱之。梁孝王朝，因昆弟燕饮。是时上未立太子，酒酣，从容言曰：“千秋之后传梁王。”太后驩。窦婴引卮酒进上,曰：“天下者，高祖天下，父子相传，此汉之约也，上何以得擅传梁王!”太后由此憎窦婴。窦婴亦薄其官，因病免。太后除窦婴门籍，不得入朝请。
梁孝王是孝景皇帝的同胞兄弟，他的母亲窦太后非常偏爱他。有一次梁孝王进京朝贡时，和孝景帝一起以兄弟的身份举行家宴，这时皇上还没有立太子，当大家喝酒喝得非常畅快时，孝景帝顺口说道：“等我死了之后我把帝位传给梁王。”窦太后听了心里非常高兴。窦婴立刻端起一杯酒上前拦阻景帝说：“汉朝的天下是高祖打下来的，我们汉朝的规矩是父子依次相传，您怎么能够随便改变章程传给梁王呢!”窦太后一听很不高兴，从此心里嫉恨窦婴。窦婴也正嫌自己的官小，赌气推说有病辞职不干了。窦太后趁着机会吊销了窦婴出入宫廷的身份证，不让他再进宫朝见皇帝。
Prince Xiao of Liang was Emperor Jing's younger brother and the favourite of Empress Dowager Dou. When he came to court the emperor entertained him as a brother. Emperor Jing had not yet designated his heir and while drinking one day he remarked casually, "When I die I shall pass on the crown to the prince of Liang.” Empress Dowager Dou was delighted, but Dou Ying presented a cup of wine to the emperor,protesting,"The empire was won by Emperor Gaozu and the rule of the House of Han is that the throne must pass from father to son. How can you make the prince of Liang your heir, sir?” Empress Dowager Dou hated Dou Ying for this, and since he did not think much of his post he retired on the pretext of illness. Then the empress dowager struck his name off the palace list so that he could no longer go to court.

孝景三年，吴楚反,上察宗室诸窦毋如窦婴贤,乃召婴。婴入见，固辞谢病不足任。太后亦惭。于是上曰：“天下方有急，王孙宁可以让邪?”乃拜婴为大将军,赐金千斤。婴乃言袁盎、栾布诸名将贤士在家者进之。所赐金，陈之廊庑下,军吏过，辄令财取为用,金无人家者。窦婴守荥阳，监齐赵兵。七国兵已尽破,封婴为魏其侯。诸游士宾客争归魏其侯。孝景时每朝议大事，条侯、魏其侯，诸列侯莫敢与亢礼。
孝景帝三年，吴、楚等国发动了叛乱，皇上观察当时刘氏本族和窦氏外戚中的子弟们没有一个能像窦婴那么能干的，于是就把窦婴找了来。窦婴进了宫，皇上向他说明了自己的意思，窦婴推说有病，说自己实在没有能力担此重任。窦太后这时对自己过去的做法也感到很惭愧。皇上对窦婴说：“国家眼下正处在紧急关头，王孙你难道还能再推辞吗?”于是就任命窦婴为大将军，赐给他黄铜千斤。窦婴受命后，随即又向孝景皇帝推荐了袁盎、栾布等一些在家闲居的将领和贤士。窦婴回来后把皇上赏给他的黄铜全数摆在了军部议事厅下的走廊里，让自己手下的军官们根据自己的需要随便拿着用，他自己一点也不往家里拿。后来窦婴东出驻守荥阳，监督策应前往齐国、赵国讨伐叛乱的汉朝军队。七国叛乱平定后，窦婴被封为魏其侯。当时有许多游说之士和宾客们都争先恐后地来投奔他。在当时朝廷里有什么聚会要商议国家大事的时候，周亚夫和窦婴的地位最高，其他列侯们谁也不能跟他们两个分庭抗礼。
When the princes of Wu and Chu rebelled in the third year of Emperor Jing, the emperor sent for Dou Ying, having decided that he was abler than anyone else in the imperial house or the Dou family. Dou Ying came to the palace, to the embarrassment of the empress dowager, but insisted that he was too ill to take up a command. "At a time of crisis how can you refuse?"demanded the emperor. He made Dou Ying grand marshal and presented him with a thousand catties of gold. Then Dou Ying recommended Yuan Ang, Luan Bu and other good army officers or scholars who were living in retirement. He stacked the gold in his corridor and gatehouse so that officers who needed it could help themselves. None of it went to his own family. Dou Ying defended Xingyang and kept a watch over the forces of Qiand Zhao. After the suppression of the revolt he was enfeoffed as marquis of Weiqi. Then wandering scholars and protegés flocked to him eagerly to offer their services. During the reign of Emperor Jing, no other nobles dared claim equality with the marquis of Tiao and the marquis of Weiqi in any important deliberations at court.

孝景四年，立栗太子，使魏其侯为太子傅。孝景七年，栗太子废,魏其数争不能得。魏其谢病，屏居蓝田南山之下数月,诸宾客辩士说之，莫能来。梁人高遂乃说魏其曰:“能富贵将军者，上也；能亲将军者，太后也。今将军傅太子，太子废而不能争；争不能得，又弗能死。自引谢病，拥赵女，屏闲处而不朝。相提而论，是自明扬主上之过。有如两宫螫将军,则妻子毋类矣。”魏其侯然之，乃遂起，朝请如故。
孝景帝四年，立栗姬生的儿子刘荣为太子，任命窦婴为太子的师傅。孝景帝七年，太子刘荣被废，窦婴为此多次力争均未能挽回。于是窦婴推说有病辞职不干了，他隐居在蓝田县的南山下一住就是几个月，他门下的那些宾朋说客们百般劝说，他就是不出来。这时一个名叫高遂的梁国人对窦婴说：“能够让您富贵的是皇上，和您关系最近的是太后。您给太子做师傅，太子被废时您不能劝阻；劝阻不成时您又不能自杀。到头来您只是推说有病整天搂着美女，躲在家里不去上朝。把您这干什么和不干什么一对比，不是分明显出您对皇上的不满吗?有朝一日要是皇上和太后合起来整您，那时您恐怕就要被满门抄斩了。”窦婴一听有理，于是立刻由山里出来又去照常上朝了。
In the fourth year of Emperor Jing, his son by Lady Li was made crown prince and Dou Ying was appointed as his tutor. In the seventh year the crown prince was deposed although Dou Ying interceded for him several times. Pleading illness he retired for several months to Lantian in the south hills, nor could any of his orators or protéges prevail on him to return. Then Gao Sui of Liang reasoned with him saying," The emperor has conferred rank and wealth on you, the empress dowager has befriended you. You were the crown prince's tutor, yet you failed to prevent his being deposed and failed to die for him. You simply retired here on the pretext of illness to fondle beauties from Zhao and voice opinions at variance with those of the court. This means you are casting aspersions on your sovereign. Should the emperor and empress dowager turn against you, your whole family must perish.” Convinced by this argument Dou Ying went back and started attending court as before.

桃侯免相,窦太后数言魏其侯。孝景帝曰：“太后岂以为臣有爱，不相魏其?魏其者，沾沾自喜耳，多易。难以为相，持重。”遂不用，用建陵侯卫绾为丞相。
桃侯刘舍被免去丞相后，窦太后一连几次谈到让窦婴为丞相。孝景帝说：“您难道以为我是有什么吝惜，才不让窦婴当丞相吗?不是的，窦婴这个人，容易自满骄傲，举动轻率，很难让他做丞相，担当国家重任。”于是就没有任用窦婴，而任用了建陵侯卫绾。
When the marquis of Tao was dismissed from his post as prime minister, Empress Dowager Dou several times recommended Dou Ying. "Don't think, madam, that I begrudge him the post," said the emperor. "But Dou Ying has too good an opinion of himself and takes life too easily. He is not fit for a responsible post like that of prime minister." He appointed Wei Wan the marquis of Jianling instead.

武安侯田蚡者,孝景后同母弟也,生长陵。魏其已为大将军后，方盛，蚡为诸郎,未贵，往来侍酒魏其，跪起如子姓。及孝景晚节，蚡益贵幸，为太中大夫。蚡辩有口，学槃盂诸书,王太后贤之。孝景崩，即日太子立，称制,所镇抚多有田蚡宾客计策。蚡弟田胜,皆以太后弟，孝景后三年封蚡为武安侯,胜为周阳侯。
武安侯田蚡，是孝景王皇后同母异父的弟弟，出生在长陵。当窦婴已经做了大将军声势正在煊盛的时候，田蚡还只是个小郎官，还远没有发达起来，这时他经常到窦婴家中应酬讨好，见了窦婴作揖磕头，行为完全像个晚辈。等到孝景帝晚年，田蚡就越来越受到宠爱了，被任为太中大夫。田蚡能言善辩，还学过一些古代陶器上的铭文，他的姐姐王太后很赏识他。孝景帝死后，太子刘彻当天就继位做了皇帝，由于武帝当时年龄小，王太后代行皇帝职权，在这新旧交替的关键时刻，在维持政局防止动乱方面，田蚡和他的门客们出了不少主意。田蚡和他的弟弟田胜，都因为是王太后的弟弟，在孝景帝后元三年，田蚡被封为武安侯，田胜被封为周阳侯。
Tian Fen, the marquis of Wuan and younger brother of Empress Wang, was born in Changling. When Dou Ying was grand marshal and at the height of his power, Tian Fen was still a palace guard, not yet ennobled. He used to go to Dou Ying's house and wait on him as a cup-bearer as humbly as his son. Towards the end of Emperor Jing's reign, however, Tian Fen had risen to become grand counsellor. Tian Fen was eloquent, he had studied the ancient precepts inscribed on bronze vessels, and his sister, Empress Wang thought highly of him. The day that Emperor Jing died, the crown prince ascended the throne with the empress dowager as regent,and many of the security measures she took were proposed by Tian Fen's followers. Because they were the empress dowager's brothers, Tian Fen and his younger brother Tian Sheng were enfeoffed in the last year of Emperor Jing's reign as the marquises of Wuan and Zhouyang.

武安侯新欲用事为相,卑下宾客，进名士家居者贵之，欲以倾魏其诸将相。建元元年,丞相绾病免,上议置丞相、太尉。籍福说武安侯曰:“魏其贵久矣，天下士素归之。今将军初兴,未如魏其，即上以将军为丞相，必让魏其。魏其为丞相，将军必为太尉。太尉、丞相尊等耳,又有让贤名。”武安侯乃微言太后风上，于是乃以魏其侯为丞相，武安侯为太尉。籍福贺魏其侯，因吊曰:“君侯资性喜善疾恶，方今善人誉君侯，故至丞相；然君侯且疾恶，恶人众，亦且毁君侯。君侯能兼容,则幸久；不能，今以毁去矣。”魏其不听。
田蚡获得任命，一心想当丞相，为了实现这一目标，他就故意装出一副谦恭下士的样子，给皇帝推荐了一些闲在家里没有事的知名人士让他们出来作官，目的就是想以此来排挤窦婴等在位的元老将相。汉武帝建元元年，丞相卫绾因病免职，皇上正在考虑丞相、太尉的人选。这时籍福就赶紧给田蚡建议说：“窦婴掌权很久了，天下的人士一向归附他。您刚刚兴起，声望还不如他，在这种情况下，假如皇上想让您当丞相，您一定要让给窦婴。窦婴要是当了丞相，您一定能当太尉。太尉和丞相的等级是一样的，这样您就白白地落一个让贤的名声。”田蚡一听有理，立即就把籍福的这个意思悄悄地告诉了王太后，让王太后去给皇上吹风，汉武帝立即决定任命窦婴为丞相，任命田蚡做了太尉。这时籍福又来到窦婴家，他先是向窦婴表示了祝贺，紧接着就又向窦婴表示担心说：“您天生的性情是爱好人，恨坏人，现在正是因为有好人称赞您，所以您当了丞相；但是您又特别讨厌坏人，而坏人的数目更多，他们也必然要千方百计地毁谤您。因此如果您对好人、坏人都能兼容并包，那么您的丞相就可以长期地做下去；否则，您很快就会因为坏人的诽谤而被免职了。”窦婴不听。
Since Tian Fen wanted to take power and become prime minister he was good to his guests and honoured noted scholars living in retirement, hopinghoping in this way to undermine Dou Ying and his powerful party. In the first year of the Jianyuan period,²the prime minister Wei Wan was relieved of his duties because of ill health and Emperor Wu consulted his ministers about the appointment of a new prime minister and grand marshal. JiFu advised Tian Fen, saying," Dou Ying has been prominent for a long time and worthy men from all over the land have flocked to him. Since you have just come to power and are not as influential as Dou Ying, if the emperor offers to make you prime minister you should decline in favour of Dou Ying. If he becomes prime minister you are sure to be made grand marshal. These two posts rank equal. And you will win praise for your modesty and wisdom.” Tian Fen proposed this to the empress dowager,asking her to suggest it to the emperor. Then Dou Ying was made prime minister and Tian Fen grand marshal. When Ji Fu congratulated Dou Ying he warned him," I know, sir that you naturally appreciate good men and hate evil men. Now thanks to the praise of good men you have become prime minister. But because you hate evil men and they are many, they are bound to attack you. The more tolerance you can show,the longer you will enjoy your present position. Otherwise their slander will lead to your dismissal." But Dou Ying ignored his advice.

魏其、武安俱好儒术，推毂赵绾为御史大夫,王臧为郎中令。迎鲁申公,欲设明堂,令列侯就国,除关,以礼为服制,以兴太平。举適诸窦宗室毋节行者,除其属籍。时诸外家为列侯，列侯多尚公主，皆不欲就国，以故毁日至窦太后。太后好黄老之言,而魏其、武安、赵绾、王臧等务隆推儒术，贬道家言，是以窦太后滋不说魏其等。及建元二年,御史大夫赵绾请无奏事东宫。窦太后大怒，乃罢逐赵绾、王臧等，而免丞相、太尉,以柏至侯许昌为丞相,武强侯庄青翟为御史大夫。魏其、武安由此以侯家居。
窦婴和田蚡都喜好儒家的学说，他们推荐了赵绾为御史大夫，推荐了王臧为郎中令。还把鲁国的儒生申培接到长安，想建立明堂，让住在长安的列侯们都到他们各自的封地去，想拆除各诸侯国与朝廷领地之间的关禁，要按照礼仪来制订不同等级的服饰制度，想以此来表明现在已经是一个百废俱兴的太平盛世。他们还让人检举窦氏外戚和刘氏宗族中的品质恶劣的人，一经查出就从族谱上除掉他们的名字。当时许多外戚都是列侯，而列侯们又多数是娶公主为妻，因此他们都不愿离开长安到自己的封地去，也正因此那些毁谤窦婴等人的话就整天不停地往窦太后的耳朵里灌了。窦太后喜好黄帝、老子的学说，窦婴、田蚡、赵绾、王臧等专门推行儒家的一套，贬斥道家学派，因此窦太后心里很不喜欢窦婴等人。等到汉武帝建元二年，御史大夫赵绾又建议皇上今后有事不要再去向窦太后请示。窦太后大怒，立刻下令罢免和驱逐了赵绾、王臧等人，同时免去了窦婴和田蚡的职务，另任命柏至侯许昌为丞相，任命武强侯庄青翟为御史大夫。从此窦婴和田蚡就只能以侯爵的身份在家里闲着了。
Both Dou Ying and Tian Fen admired the teachings of Confucius. Hence they recommended Zhao Wan for the post of chief counsellor and Wang Zang for that of chief of the palace guard. They invited Master Shen of Lu to the capital and wanted to set up an Audience Hall, send the marquises back to their fiefs, abolish travel restrictions, change the funeral customs to accord with the ancient practice, and bring about a reign of peace. They denounced the members of the imperial clan and kinsmen of Empress Dowager Dou who were guilty of immoral conduct and had their names struck off the list of nobles. At that time most of the men of the Dou family had become marquises and married imperial princesses, and none of them wanted to return to their territories. So every day they slandered these two ministers to Empress Dowager Dou.And because she liked the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Zi, while Dou Ying, Tian Fen, Zhao Wan and Wang Zang wanted to propagate Confucianism and suppress Taoism, her dislike for these men increased. In the second year of the Jianyuan period,the grand secretary Zhao Wan proposed that memoranda and reports should not be submitted to Empress Dowager Dou.In a great rage she dismissed him and three others and appointed Xu Chang the marquis of Bozhi as prime minister and Zhuang Qingdi the marquis of Wuqiang as grand secretary. Dou Ying and Tian Fen retired from the government but retained their titles.

武安侯虽不任职，以王太后故，亲幸，数言事多效,天下吏士趋势利者，皆去魏其归武安。武安日益横。建元六年,窦太后崩，丞相昌、御史大夫青翟坐丧事不办，免。以武安侯蚡为丞相,以大司农韩安国为御史大夫。天下士郡诸侯愈益附武安。
田蚡虽然不担任职务，但由于他是王太后的弟弟，所以仍然受到皇帝的信任，他多次向皇上提出的建议都被采纳了，于是那些势利眼的官吏和士大夫们，就都纷纷地离开窦婴去巴结田蚡。田蚡一天比一天更骄横。汉武帝建元六年，窦太后死了，丞相许昌、御史大夫庄青翟因为丧事办得不好，都被免职。武帝任命田蚡为丞相，任命大司农韩安国为御史大夫。这一来，所有的士大夫以及各郡县各诸侯国的人们就更加趋附田蚡了。
Although Tian Fen was now out of office, he was still a favourite because of Empress Dowager Wang, and his advice was often taken. And so all those officers and gentlemen who were eager for power or profit left Dou Ying and flocked to Tian Fen,who grew daily more high-handed. In the sixth year of Jianyuan, Empress Dowager Dou died. The prime minister Xu Chang and the grand secretary Zhuang Qingdi were accused of mismanaging the funeral and dismissed. Tian Fen was made prime minister with Han Anguo, the minister of revenue, as grand secretary. Thereupon the gentlemen of the empire and the marquises of the principalities rallied even more closely round him.

武安者，貌侵，生贵甚。又以为诸侯王多长,上初即位，富于春秋,蚡以肺腑为京师相,非痛折节以礼诎之，天下不肃。当是时，丞相入奏事，坐语移日,所言皆听。荐人或起家至二千石，权移主上。上乃曰：“君除吏已尽未?吾亦欲除吏。”尝请考工地益宅,上怒曰：“君何不遂取武库!”是后乃退。尝召客饮，坐其兄盖侯南乡四，自坐东乡，以为汉相尊，不可以兄故私桡。武安由此滋骄，治宅甲诸第。田园极膏腴，而市买郡县器物相属于道。前堂罗钟鼓，立曲旃;后房妇女以百数。诸侯奉金玉狗马玩好，不可胜数。
武安侯长得丑陋矮小，但生性却非常骄纵傲慢。他认为诸侯王们都年纪较大，而武帝却刚刚即位，年纪很轻，田蚡自己又只是借着外戚的关系才做了朝廷的丞相，因此他觉得必须用礼法把诸侯们狠狠地压一压，否则人们是不会服贴的。当时，田蚡进宫向皇帝奏事，坐下来一说就是半天，他说什么皇帝都得听。他推荐人做官有的白手起家，一下子就被任为二千石，权力比皇上还大。因此惹得汉武帝有一次生气地说：“您封官封完了没有?我还得封几个呢。”还有一次田蚡居然向武帝要考工室的地盘说是要扩建他的住宅，武帝生气地说：“那就干脆把我的武库也拿去算了!”经过这两次碰钉子，田蚡的气焰才有点收敛。田蚡每次在家里请客，总是让他哥哥盖侯王信面朝南坐，而他自己面朝东坐，他认为自己是汉朝的丞相地位最高，不能因为王信是自己的哥哥就使丞相受委屈。田蚡私家生活越来越豪华奢侈，他家的住宅在所有的贵族中数第一，他家占的土地都是最肥沃的地方，他家派到全国各地去采买各种物品的人在路上络绎不绝。他的前厅陈列着钟鼓，插着曲柄长旗；他家的后房里有美女几百个。至于各地诸侯们给他家进贡的金银珠宝、狗马玩物就更没法计算了。
Tian Fen was undistinguished in appearance but he attained great distinction.At that time most of the princes were old while Emperor Wuwas young when he ascended the throne. Tian Fen felt that as prime minister and a relative of the imperial house,he must force others to submit humbly to him or he would not be respected through the land. When he went to the palace to make his reports as prime minister, he would sit talking for hours, and all his proposals were accepted. When recommending men for office, he sometimes had commoners appointed as officials of the two thousand piculs rank. He became the dominant force behind the throne. Once the emperor asked,"Have you finished appointing officials? If you have, I should like to select some myself.” Another time Tian Fen asked for some land belonging to a government workshop to enlarge his estate, and the emperor retorted angrily," Why don’t you simply take over the armoury?"After that he was a little more circumspect. One day Tian Fen invited guests to a drinking party and made his elder brother, the marquis of Gai, sit facing south while he took the place of honour facing east. He explained that family etiquette must not be allowed to detract from the prime minister's dignity. As time went on he became more and more overbearing. His mansions were the finest in the land. He owned the most fertile fields, and the roads were thronged with merchants bringing him goods from all parts of the empire. In the front hall he had a display of bronze bells, drums and pennants on curved flagstaffs, while in the inner quarters were hundreds of women. As for the dogs, horses, jewels and other articles of amusement and adornment presented to him by various nobles, these were past counting.

魏其失窦太后，益疏不用，无势，诸客稍稍自引而怠傲,唯灌将军独不失故。魏其日默默不得志，而独厚遇灌将军。
相比之下，窦婴自从没有了窦太后之后，就越来越被朝廷疏远越来越不受朝廷重用了。由于他已经没有权势，所以他原来的那些门客们也就渐渐地对他懈怠傲慢起来，这时只有一个灌夫还保持着原来的样子。因此，窦婴在这种整天闷闷不乐的日子里，也就特别对灌夫好。
Dou Ying had lost power since the death of Empress Dowager Dou and one by one all his protégés left him in contempt except General Guan Fu. Thus Dou Ying, in his bitterness and frustration, treated General Guan Fu as his only friend.

灌将军夫者，颍阴人也。夫父张孟，尝为颍阴侯婴舍人,得幸，因进之至二千石，故蒙灌氏姓为灌孟。吴楚反时，颍阴侯灌何为将军,属太尉,请灌孟为校尉。夫以千人与父俱。灌孟年老，颍阴侯强请之，郁郁不得意,故战常陷坚,遂死吴军中。军法，父子俱从军，有死事，得与丧归。灌夫不肯随丧归，奋曰：“愿取吴王若将军头,以报父之仇。”于是灌夫被甲持戟，募军中壮士所善愿从者数十人。及出壁门，莫敢前。独二人及从奴十数骑驰入吴军，至吴将麾下，所杀伤数十人。不得前，复驰还，走入汉壁，皆亡其奴，独与一骑归。夫身中大创十余，适有万金良药，故得无死。夫创少瘳，又复请将军曰：“吾益知吴壁中曲折，请复往。”将军壮义之,恐亡夫，乃言太尉，太尉乃固止之。吴已破，灌夫以此名闻天下。
灌夫是颍阴人。他的父亲叫张孟，由于张孟曾经在颍阴侯灌婴门下当过宾客，受到过灌婴的赏识，因此渐渐地被提拔到了二千石，也就由于这层关系所以张孟就用了灌家的姓改名叫灌孟了。吴、楚七国造反时，灌婴的儿子灌何被任命为将军，隶属于周亚夫部下，于是灌何就请求让灌孟给他做了校尉。这时灌夫也以一个千夫长的身份跟着他的父亲一同出征了。当时灌孟已经年老，是灌何竭力向周亚夫请求，周亚夫才同意的，所以灌孟总是闷闷不乐，打仗时总是故意向着敌人防守最坚固的地方冲，结果战死在了吴军的阵前。依照当时的军法规定，父子两个都在军队里的，其中有一个死了，另一个就可以送丧回家。但是灌夫不愿意随着父亲的灵柩回去，而是悲愤激昂地请求说：“我一定要去取吴王或者他的一个什么将军的人头，来为我的父亲报仇。”于是他就披甲持戟叫上军中一向和他关系不错的几十个勇士准备一起去向吴军拼命。结果一出营门，许多人都不敢去了。只剩下两个士兵和他从自己家里带出来的十来个奴隶跟着他一起冲进了吴军阵内，他们一直冲到吴军大将的指挥旗下，杀死杀伤吴军几十个人。最后实在前进不了了，才撤了回来。等回到汉营一看，跟着灌夫冲进吴营的十来个奴隶都没有回来，只有一个士兵跟着他一起回来了。这时灌夫身负重伤十多处，当时正赶上身边带着好药，所以没死。等到灌夫的伤势稍有好转时，他又向灌何请求说：“我现在更了解吴军里边的情况了，我要求还去。”灌何对他这种表现很欣赏很敬佩，但担心他会由此送命，于是就把情况报告了周亚夫，周亚夫制止了他。等到吴军被打败后，灌夫的名字也就传遍天下了。
General Guan Fu was a man of Yingyin. His father Zhang Meng had been a favourite steward of Guan Ying, the marquis of Yingyin, who raised him to be an official of the two thousand piculs rank. Out of gratitude he took Guan's name, becoming Guan Meng. During the rebellion of Wu and Chu, Guan He, the second marquis of Yingyin, served as a general under the grand marshal and Guan Meng was made a general. Guan Fu accompanied his father to the war at the head of a thousand men. By this time Guan Meng was an old man, but the marquis of Yingyin insisted that he should accept the command; so in his resentment he kept charging the enemy's strong points until he was cut down by the troops of Wu. According to the military regulations, when both father and son serve in the army and one is killed, the other may ask leave to attend to the funeral. But instead of doing this, Guan Fu hotly vowed, "I shall avenge my father by cutting off the head of the prince of Wu or one of his generals.” He buckled on his armour, seized his halberd, and called for a few dozen volunteers to go with him. Once outside their ramparts,however, the others dared not charge the enemy. Only two men and about a dozen attendants galloped with him through the ranks of Wu. They fought their way up to one of the enemy flags and killed or wounded several dozen men, but could advance no further. By the time Guan Fu galloped back to the Han ramparts, all his attendants were dead and only one man returned with him. Guan Fu himself had received more than ten serious wounds, but his life was saved with a precious salve. When he had somewhat recovered, he asked permission to try again now that he had a better idea of Wu's defences. His general ad- mired his spirit but did not want to lose him, so he reported the matter to the grand marshal who forbade Guan Fu to make the attempt. After the prince of Wu's defeat, Guan Fu's fame spread through- out the land.

颍阴侯言之上,上以夫为中郎将。数月，坐法去。后家居长安，长安中诸公莫弗称之。孝景时，至代相。孝景崩，今上初即位，以为淮阳天下交,劲兵处，故徙夫为淮阳太守。建元元年，入为太仆。二年,夫与长乐卫尉窦甫饮,轻重不得,夫醉，搏甫。甫，窦太后昆弟也。上恐太后诛夫，徙为燕相。数岁，坐法去官，家居长安。
灌何回朝后向景帝汇报了灌夫的表现，景帝任命灌夫为中郎将。结果只干了几个月，就因为犯法被免职了。后来他搬家到长安居住，长安城里的阔人们没有不称赞他的。后来他又被起用，做过代国的丞相。孝景帝死后，当今皇上刚刚即位，他觉得淮阳是天下的交通枢纽，是兵家必争之地，所以改调灌夫为淮阳太守。武帝建元元年，又调灌夫进京做了太仆。第二年，灌夫跟长乐卫尉窦甫一起饮酒，两人因为点什么发生了争执，结果灌夫乘着喝醉打了窦甫，窦甫是窦太后的亲兄弟，武帝怕窦太后杀灌夫，便把灌夫调到了燕国去做丞相。几年后，又因为犯法丢了官，在长安家中闲着。
The marquis of Yingyin reported this to the emperor, who made Guan Fu general of the palace guard. A few months later, however, he was dismissed for some offence. He made his home in the capital and everyone in Chang'an spoke highly of him.During the reign of Emperor Jing he was appointed as chief minister of the principality of Dai. After Emperor Jing died and the present emperor had just come to the throne, Guan Fu was appointed as governor of Huaiyang be- cause that was a centre of communications and a military stronghold. In the first year of Jianyuan, he served as minister of the imperial equipage. The next year while drinking one day with Dou Fu,commander of the Changle Palace guard,Guan Fu quarrelled with him and,being in his cups,struck him.Dou Fu was the younger brother of empress Dowager Dou.Afraid the empress dowager might have Guan Fu killed,the emperor transferred him to be the chief minister of the principality of Yan.Several years later he was dismissed for some offence and returned to the capital to live in retirement.

灌夫为人刚直使酒,不好面谀。贵戚诸有势在己之右，不欲加礼，必陵之；诸士在己之左，愈贫贱，尤益敬，与钧。稠人广众，荐宠下辈。士亦以此多之。夫不喜文学,好任侠，已然诺。诸所与交通，无非豪杰大猾。家累数千万，食客日数十百人。陂池田园,宗族宾客为权利，横于颍川。颍川儿乃歌之曰：“颍水清，灌氏宁；颍水浊，灌氏族。”
灌夫为人刚强正直，经常饮酒发脾气，不喜欢当面讨好人。那些皇亲贵戚权力比他大的，他偏对他们不礼貌，偏要欺侮他们；那些地位比他低下的士大夫，越是贫贱的，他反而越是敬重他们，同他们平起平坐。他在大庭广众之中，特别好推荐表扬那些地位比他低的人，因此使得人们都很称赞他。灌夫不喜欢儒家学说，而好行侠尚义，凡是答应人的话一定办到。他所结交的大都是一些地面上的豪绅和帮派头目。他家里有几千万的资产，在他门下寄食的每天都有几十以至上百人。他家有大量的肥沃土地和蓄水池塘，他的家族和他的宾客们仗着他的势力，在颍川郡里横行霸道。当时颍川有一首儿歌唱道：“颍水清清，灌氏安宁；颍水浑浊，灌氏灭族。”
Guan Fu was strong-willed, outspoken and boisterous when drunk. He never flattered anybody. He behaved in a cavalier and insulting way to nobles and all who were more powerful than himself, but treated those below him as his equals—the poorer they were, the more respect he showed. In a large group he always singled out his inferiors for attention, and gentlemen admired him for this trait. He had no taste for literature but admired gallant deeds of daring and kept his word without fail. All his friends were prominent citizens or men of great resourcefulness. His property ran into tens of millions of cash, and he daily entertained tens and hundreds of guests. His estates were large, including hills, lakes and fields, and he had a host of kinsmen and protegés. His power went unchallenged in Yingchuan, where the children used to sing: When the River Ying runs clear, The Guans have nothing to fear; When the River Ying runs muddy, The Guans' end will be bloody!

灌夫家居虽富，然失势，卿相侍中宾客益衰。及魏其侯失势，亦欲倚灌夫引绳批根生平慕之后弃之者。灌夫亦倚魏其而通列侯宗室为名高。两人相为引重,其游如父子然。相得欢甚，无厌，恨相知晚也。
灌夫的家庭虽然富有，但由于他在政治上的失势，所以过去那些和他来往密切的卿相、侍中一类有身份的朋友就越来越少了。等到窦婴也失势后，窦婴就想依靠灌夫去惩治那些原先趋附过自己后来又扔下自己去另投高门的人；而灌夫则正好想借着窦婴的关系去结交那些列侯宗室一类的大贵族以提高自己的声望。于是两个人相互引荐提携，关系亲密得像父子一样。他们亲密和谐，永不厌倦，而且只恨相识得太晚了。
But although Guan Fu was wealthy, his power declined once he was out of office and the ministers, courtiers and protégés who had associated with him stayed away. So when Dou Ying also lost power, he was eager to join forces with Guan Fu and sever relations with those former admirers who had now deserted him.Guan Fu for his part hoped with the help of Dou Ying to make friends with other nobles and imperial clansmen and so increase his reputation. The mutual attraction and admiration they felt made the two men as close as father and son. They got on capitally together, never tiring of each other's company; they only regretted that they had not met earlier

灌夫有服,过丞相。丞相从容曰：“吾欲与仲孺过魏其侯,会仲孺有服。”灌夫曰：“将军乃肯幸临况魏其侯,夫安敢以服为解!请语魏其侯帐具,将军旦日蚤临。”武安许诺。灌夫具语魏其侯如所谓武安侯。魏其与其夫人益市牛酒，夜洒扫，帐具至旦。平明，令门下候伺。至日中，丞相不来。魏其谓灌夫曰：“丞相岂忘之哉?”灌夫不怿，曰：“夫以服请，宜往。”乃驾，自往迎丞相。丞相特前戏许灌夫，殊无意往。及夫至门，丞相尚卧。于是夫入见，曰：“将军昨日幸许过魏其，魏其夫妻治具，自旦至今，未敢尝食。”武安鄂谢曰:“吾昨日醉，忽忘与仲孺言。”乃驾往，又徐行，灌夫愈益怒。及饮酒酣，夫起舞属丞相,丞相不起，夫从坐上语侵之。魏其乃扶灌夫去，谢丞相。丞相卒饮至夜，极驩而去四。
有一次，灌夫还在为他姐姐服丧，偶然到田蚡家里去了。田蚡顺口说：“本来想和你一起去看看魏其侯，不巧正赶上你有丧服在身。”灌夫说：“只要您肯赏光去魏其侯家，我怎么会以丧服在身推辞呢!请让我先去告诉魏其侯家准备酒席，请您明天一早大驾光临。”田蚡答应了。灌夫赶紧来到窦婴家把他同田蚡说的话向窦婴说了一遍，窦婴一听就赶紧同他的夫人准备了许多酒肉，连夜打扫厅堂，摆设筵席一直忙到天亮。从天亮开始窦婴就派了人到门前去张望着，一直等到中午，田蚡还没来。于是窦婴就对灌夫说：“丞相莫非是忘了吗?”灌夫也不高兴地说：“我昨天是不顾丧服在身邀请了他，他不应该不来，我可以去看看。”于是就赶着车子亲自去迎接田蚡。而田蚡昨天其实只不过是开玩笑随便说说，内心里就根本没有打算去。等到灌夫到了他家，田蚡还没有起床。灌夫进来问田蚡说：“昨天承蒙您答应去拜访魏其侯，魏其侯夫妇为您准备筵席，从一大早到现在，因为您没有去，人家还一直不敢动筷子。”田蚡一听吃了一惊赶紧道歉说：“我昨天喝醉了，忘了同你说过的话。”说罢前往，在路上又走得很慢，于是灌夫心里就觉得很恼火。等到在窦婴家大家喝酒喝得高兴时，灌夫站起来跳舞，然后又邀请田蚡接着跳。不想田蚡竟坐着不动，灌夫忍不住就在自己的坐位上骂了起来。窦婴一看赶紧起来打圆场，扶着灌夫离开了席面，他自己过去向田蚡解释道歉。田蚡也就放开了，于是他们一直喝到夜晚，田蚡尽兴而去。
One day when Guan Fu was in mourning he called on Tian Fen the prime minister, who remarked casually," I would like to go with you to see Dou Ying the marquis of Weiqi. It is a pity that you are in mourning." "If Your Excellency means to do him that honour, I certainly can- not let my mourning stand in the way," said Guan Fu." May I tell him to prepare for a visit from you early tomorrow?" Tian Fen agreed. Guan Fu told Dou Ying what he had said to Tian Fen. Then Dou Ying and his wife bought plenty of beef and wine and spent the whole night cleaning and sweeping their house to have all ready for the feast. Early the next morning they posted attendants outside the gate to keep a look-out for the prime minister, but though they waited till noon he did not come. Dou Ying asked Guan Fu, "Could the prime minister have forgotten?” "I invited him in spite of my mourning," replied Guan Fu sullenly. "He ought to have come." And he took a carriage to fetch Tian Fen. Tian Fen had been joking the previous day as it happened, and had no intention of going. When Guan Fu reached his gate he was still in bed. Guan Fu strode in and said, "Yesterday Your Excellency promised to call on the marquis of Weiqi. He and his wife have prepared a feast and been waiting since early morning, not venturing to take a bite.” Tian Fen was taken aback and apologized, saying," I must have had too much to drink yesterday. It completely slipped my mind." He set off in his carriage but drove so slowly that Guan Fu grew even angrier than before. At the height of the feast Guan Fu rose to dance, after which he urged Tian Fen to perform a dance, but the latter refused to move. Then Guan Fu sat there making cutting remarks till Dou Ying dragged him out and apologized for him to the prime minister. Tian Fen stayed and drank till nightfall, when he went cheerfully away.

丞相尝使籍福请魏其城南田。魏其大望曰：“老仆虽弃，将军虽贵，宁可以势夺乎!”不许。灌夫闻，怒，骂籍福。籍福恶两人有郄,乃谩自好谢丞相曰:“魏其老且死，易忍，且待之。”已而武安闻魏其、灌夫实怒不予田，亦怒曰：“魏其子尝杀人，蚡活之。蚡事魏其无所不可,何爱数顷田?且灌夫何与也?吾不敢复求田。”武安由此大怨灌夫、魏其。
田蚡有一次让籍福去向窦婴要他家城南的一块地。窦婴不高兴地说：“我虽然被朝廷抛弃了，田将军虽然正在贵宠，难道他就可以倚仗权势来夺我的地吗!”坚决不答应。灌夫听说这事后，非常生气，他当面大骂籍福。籍福害怕两家的矛盾由此加深，于是就自己另编了一套话，对田蚡说：“魏其侯老得活不多久了，您稍微忍耐几天，等他死了再说。”过后不久田蚡知道了原来是窦婴和灌夫生气不给他，于是也生气地说：“魏其侯的儿子曾经杀人犯了死罪，是我救了他的命。我对待魏其侯没有一样不满足他的要求，怎么他今天就连几顷地也舍不得?而且这件事又与灌夫有什么关系?算了，我再也不和他要这块地了。”田蚡从此就特别痛恨灌夫和窦婴。
Later on, Tian Fen sent Ji Fu to ask Dou Ying for some fields south of the city which he owned. Dou Ying refused, indignantly exclaiming," I may be an old man who has been pushed aside while he holds the high rank of prime minister, but he has no right to seize my land.” When Guan Fu heard this he cursed Ji Fu roundly. Anxious to avoid a quarrel between Tian Fen and Dou Ying, Ji Fu made some excuses to the prime minister to smooth the matter over." Dou Ying is old and won't live much longer," he said. "Just be patient and wait.” But when Tian Fen learned that Dou Ying and Guan Fu had an- grily refused to give up the fields, he flew into a passion." I saved Dou Ying's son after he killed a man,"he fumed." I have treated him handsomely in every respect. Why should he grudge me a few plots of land? In any case, what has this to do with Guan Fu? Well, I shall not ask again." From that day on,Tian Fen bore a deep grudge against Guan Fu and Dou Ying.

元光四年春,丞相言灌夫家在颍川，横甚，民苦之。请案。上曰：“此丞相事，何请。”灌夫亦持丞相阴事，为奸利,受淮南王金与语言。宾客居间，遂止，俱解。
元光四年春天，田蚡向武帝揭发灌夫家族在颍川骄横霸道，百姓们大吃苦头，请求依法查办。武帝说：“这是你职务以内的事情，不必向我请示。”但由于灌夫也抓着田蚡的一些把柄，诸如为非作歹图谋私利，接受淮南王的贿赂，以及说了许多不该说的话等等。由于两家的宾客们从中调解，于是彼此又都停了下来，暂时和解了。
In the spring of the fourth year of Yuanguang, Tian Fen reported to the emperor,“ Guan Fu's family in Yingchuan is so overbearing that the people are suffering. I ask for an investigation." "This is within your jurisdiction as prime minister," replied the emperor.“Why ask my permission?” Guan Fu for his part knew something of Tian Fen's dark deeds and corruption, and was aware that he was in communication with the prince of Huainan and had accepted bribes from him. But friends intervened to patch things up between them.

夏，丞相取燕王女为夫人,有太后诏，召列侯宗室皆往贺。魏其侯过灌夫，欲与俱。夫谢曰：“夫数以酒失得过丞相，丞相今者又与夫有郄。”魏其曰：“事已解。”强与俱。饮酒酣，武安起为寿，坐皆避席伏。已魏其侯为寿，独故人避席耳，余半膝席。灌夫不悦。起行酒，至武安，武安膝席曰：“不能满觞。”夫怒，因嘻笑曰：“将军贵人也，属之!”时武安不肯。行酒次至临汝侯，临汝侯方与程不识耳语,又不避席。夫无所发怒，乃骂临汝侯曰:“生平毁程不识不直一钱，今日长者为寿，乃效女儿咕嗫耳语!”武安谓灌夫曰：“程李俱东西宫卫尉,今众辱程将军，仲孺独不为李将军地乎?”灌夫曰：“今日斩头陷匈四，何知程李乎!”坐乃起更衣，稍稍去。魏其侯去，麾灌夫出。武安遂怒曰：“此吾骄灌夫罪。”乃令骑留灌夫。灌夫欲出不得。籍福起为谢，案灌夫项令谢。夫愈怒，不肯谢。武安乃麾骑缚夫置传舍,召长史曰:“今日召宗室，有诏。”劾灌夫骂坐不敬，系居室。遂按其前事，遣吏分曹逐捕诸灌氏支属，皆得弃市罪。魏其侯大愧,为资使宾客请，莫能解。武安吏皆为耳目，诸灌氏皆亡匿，夫系，遂不得告言武安阴事。
同年夏天，田蚡娶燕王刘嘉的女儿做夫人，太后下令，叫列侯宗室们都要前去祝贺。这时窦婴去找灌夫，要和他一道去。灌夫推辞说：“我曾多次因酒后失言得罪过他，我看他近来似乎对我特别仇恨。”窦婴说：“过去的事情不是都已经解开了吗。”于是硬拉着灌夫一同去了。到了宴会上人们酒兴正浓的时候，田蚡站起来给大家敬酒，于是在座的人都赶快离开席位俯伏在地，表示不敢当。过了一会儿窦婴也起来给大家敬酒，这回只有他的老朋友们离开席位，其余半数的人都只是在席上跪起身子而没有离席。灌夫看着心里生气，于是就自己起来给大家敬酒，当他走到田蚡跟前时，田蚡跪起身子推辞说：“不能再太满了。”灌夫心里生气，嘴里用一种嘲弄的腔调说：“您是贵人，干了这一杯!”田蚡坚持不喝。灌夫无法，接着敬酒到了临汝侯灌贤的面前，当时灌贤正在跟程不识咬着耳朵说话，没有注意，又没有离席。灌夫满腔怒火正没有地方发泄，于是就指着临汝侯骂道：“平常在底下你也把程不识贬得一钱不值，今天有年纪的人来给你敬酒了，你倒反而和他像小孩子似地叽叽咕咕个没完!”田蚡一看赶紧拦阻说：“程不识和李广一起分别在长乐宫和未央宫做卫尉，今天你当众侮辱程将军，难道就不为李将军留点面子吗?”灌夫说：“今天我连砍头穿胸都不怕了，我还顾什么程将军李将军!”座上的宾客们一看事情要闹大于是就推说上厕所，一个个地向外溜。这时窦婴也站起来，挥手叫灌夫一起走。而田蚡这时已经怒吼说：“这都是我平常对灌夫太迁就，所以他今天才敢这么放肆!”说罢下令武士拦住灌夫。灌夫这时已经是想走也走不了了。籍福一看就赶快起来帮他们调停，他按着灌夫的脖子想让他向田蚡认个错。而灌夫当时更是火上浇油，坚决不肯。于是田蚡就让武士们把灌夫捆起来看守在客馆里，他把自己的长史叫来吩咐说：“今天我请诸位宗室来，是奉了太后的命令。"于是就让长史起草奏章弹劾灌夫这种辱骂宾客是对太后命令的大不敬，并很快把灌夫关进了监狱。接着田蚡就收集整理灌夫以往的各种不法行为，迅速派人分头把灌夫家族的各个支派一网打尽，通通地判为死罪。窦婴这时感到太对不起灌夫了，就百般地花钱请宾客们去说情，结果一概无效。这时田蚡的下属官吏，都为田蚡作耳目，灌夫那些没有被抓起来的党羽们也都逃脱躲藏了起来，灌夫自己又被下在狱里，于是就没法去向皇上揭发田蚡的问题了。
That summer Tian Fen married the daughter of the prince of Yan, and the empress dowager decreed that all the nobles and members of the imperial house should go to offer their congratulations. Dou Ying called to ask Guan Fu to accompany him, but Guan Fu declined. "I have offended the prime minister several times when in my cups," he said. “And now he has another grudge against me.” "But all that has been settled," said Dou Ying, and prevailed upon Guan Fu to go with him. When the drinking was at its height Tian Fen rose to propose a toast, at which all his guests left their mats and bowed low. But when Dou Ying proposed a toast only his friends left their mats, all the other guests simply kneeling where they were. Guan Fu took umbrage at this and rose to urge the rest to drink. When he came to Tian Fen, the prime minister merely knelt on his mat and said, "I cannot drink a whole cup.” Guan Fu was furious but he forced a smile. “A great man like Your Excellency must drink up!" he cried. Sill Tian Fen refused to drink. Next Guan Fu went to the marquis of Linru, who was whispering to Cheng Bushi and did not leave his mat either. To vent his anger, Guan Fu swore at him, “You usually run down Cheng Bushi as if he were not worth a cent; yet today when one of your elders offers you a toast, you are whispering into his ear like a girl!” Tian Fen drew him aside and warned him, “Cheng Bushi and Li Guang are commanders of the guard at the East and West Palaces. If you insult General Cheng in public like this, what must General Li feel?” "I am ready to have my head cut off or my chest ripped open," retorted Guan Fu. “What do I care about either Cheng or Li?” One by one the guests went off to the lavatory and then slipped away, and Dou Ying signed to Guan Fu to go with him. But Tian Fen exclaimed angrily, That was my own falt—Ilet Guan Fugo too far!” He ordered his horsemen to detain Guan Fu, so that he could not leave. Ji Fu rose to apologize for him, putting a hand on the back of his neck to force him to apologize.Then Tian Fen ordered his horsemen to bind him and hold him prisoner. Summoning his chief officer, he said, "Today I invited members of the imperial house at the order of the empress dowager. Because Guan Fu swore at my guests and showed no respect, I have detained him in my house.” Then he brought up the old charges against Guan Fu and sent officers to arrest his entire clan, accusing them of capital offences. Dou Ying, bitterly repenting his part in this, laid out money and sent men to beg for Guan Fu's release, but all to no avail. With Tian Fen's officers hot on their track, all hte Guans went into hiding; and since Guan Fu himself was under arrest he could not report Tian Fen's misdeeds to the emperor.

魏其锐身为救灌夫。夫人谏魏其曰：“灌将军得罪丞相，与太后家忤，宁可救邪?”魏其侯曰：“侯自我得之，自我捐之，无所恨。且终不令灌仲孺独死，婴独生。”乃匿其家,窃出上书。立召人，具言灌夫醉饱事，不足诛。上然之，赐魏其食,曰：“东朝廷辩之。”
这时只有窦婴仍在不顾一切地救灌夫。他的夫人劝他说：“灌将军得罪了丞相，跟太后家的亲戚过不去，这难道还救得了吗?”窦婴说：“我的爵位是我自己挣来的，即使我自己把它搞丢了，我也没有什么遗憾。而且无论如何我也不能眼看着灌夫被杀，而我自己一个人活着。”于是他瞒着家里人，偷偷地出去给武帝上书。武帝马上把他叫进宫去，这时窦婴就把灌夫因为喝醉了酒当众骂人的事向武帝说了一遍，认为这样的事情够不上杀头。武帝同意窦婴的看法，还招待他吃了饭，说：“明天到东宫去把这件事当众辩论清楚。”
Dou Ying made every effort to save Guan Fu, although his wife warned him, “General Guan has offended the prime minister and annoyed the empress dowager and her family. How can you save him?” "I won the title of marquis for myself and can give it up without regret," replied her husband. "I cannot let Guan Fu die while I am alive.” Unknown to his family, he slipped out and presented a memorial to the throne. He was immediately summoned to the palace, where he explained that Guan Fu had been drunk during the feast and that this offence should not be punished by death. The emperor agreed and kept him to a meal, then said, “Go and argue your case now in the East Empress Dowager's Court."

魏其之东朝，盛推灌夫之善，言其醉饱得过，乃丞相以他事诬罪之。武安又盛毁灌夫所为横恣，罪逆不道。魏其度不可奈何，因言丞相短。武安曰：“天下幸而安乐无事，蚡得为肺腑，所好音乐狗马田宅。蚡所爱倡优巧匠之属，不如魏其、灌夫日夜招聚天下豪桀壮士与论议，腹诽而心谤，不仰视天而俯画地,辟倪两宫间,幸天下有变，而欲有大功。臣乃不知魏其等所为。”于是上问朝臣：“两人孰是?”御史大夫韩安国曰：“魏其言灌夫父死事，身荷戟驰入不测之吴军，身被数十创，名冠三军，此天下壮士，非有大恶,争杯酒，不足引他过以诛也。魏其言是也。丞相亦言灌夫通奸猾，侵细民，家累巨万，横恣颍川，凌铄宗室，侵犯骨肉,此所谓‘枝大于本，胫大于股，不折必披’,丞相言亦是。唯明主裁之。”主爵都尉汲黯是魏其。内史郑当时是魏其，后不敢坚对四。余皆莫敢对。上怒内史曰：“公平生数言魏其、武安长短，今日廷论，局趣效辕下驹,吾并斩若属矣。”即罢起入，上食太后。太后亦已使人候伺，具以告太后。太后怒，不食，曰：“今我在也，而人皆藉吾弟,令我百岁后，皆鱼肉之矣。且帝宁能为石人邪!此特帝在，即录录,设百岁后，是属宁有可信者乎?”上谢曰：“俱宗室外家,故廷辩之。不然，此一狱吏所决耳。”是时郎中令石建为上分别言两人事。
窦婴到了东宫，就极力说灌夫的好话，并说他这次是酒醉失言犯了点错误，而丞相却用其他事情来诬陷他。接着田蚡则是大肆诋毁灌夫的所作所为，说他横行不法，大逆无道。窦婴眼看着单是这样下去，不会有什么结果，于是就转过来揭发田蚡的短处。而田蚡则说：“现在天下太平无事，我有幸作为皇上的亲戚，我所好的无非是音乐狗马田产房屋，我所爱的不过是唱歌跳舞的优伶以及能工巧匠之流，我不像魏其侯、灌夫他们招引着一帮子豪杰壮士整天在那里说长道短，诋毁朝廷，他们不是仰观天象，就是俯察地理，他们斜着眼睛窥测着东、西两宫，就盼着天下出什么变故，他们好趁机办大事。我真不知道魏其侯等人到底是在干什么。”武帝见两人争执不下就转问朝臣们说：“你们看他们两人谁说得对?”御史大夫韩安国说：“魏其侯谈到灌夫的父亲战死时，灌夫持戟策马冲入吴军，身上负伤几十处，名冠三军，这是天下难得的勇士，只要没有什么太大的罪恶，光是因为酒宴上的一点小问题，是不能用别的借口杀他的。从这一点上说，魏其侯说得对。丞相也说了灌夫结交坏人，侵害百姓，以至于积累了上亿的家产，在颍川郡里横行霸道，欺侮宗室，侵犯朝廷的骨肉，这就是俗话所说的树枝大于树干，小腿大于大腿，不折断它就要损害本体，从这点看来，丞相说得也对。请英明的皇上自己裁夺。”接着主爵都尉汲黯发言，赞成窦婴的说法。随后内史郑当时发言他先表示同意窦婴的说法，但后来又不敢坚持了。其余的人谁都不敢发言。武帝生气地对郑当时说：“你平常总爱议论魏其侯和武安侯的长短，今天让你当众表态了，你却这么萎萎缩缩地像一匹车辕子下头的小马驹，小心我杀了你们!”说罢站起身来回了内室，去侍候太后吃饭了。这时太后也早已派人在前边窥听，待至窥听的人向太后报告了辩论的情况后，太后很生气，不吃饭了，她望着武帝说：“今天我还活着，那些人居然就敢这么糟践我的弟弟；要是日后我死了，他们还不把我弟弟当作鱼肉任意宰割吗。再说，你自己难道就会像一个石头人一样万古长存吗!现在你还活着，你就这么碌碌无为，假如你日后死了，这些人有一个可以信赖的吗?”武帝赶忙向太后赔礼说：“因为都是亲戚，所以我才让他们在大廷上公开辩论。如果不是亲戚，这种事情还不是派一个狱吏就可以解决了嘛。”这时郎中令石建又在背后给武帝分析了窦婴和田蚡的事情。
So Dou Ying went to the East Court. There he stressed Guan Fu's good qualities, admitted that he had drunk too much, but declared that the prime minister was now bringing false charges against him. There- upon Tian Fen expatiated at length on Guan Fu's arrogance and lawlessness, declaring him guilty of treason. Since Dou Ying feared he could not refute these charges, he started enumerating the prime minister's own faults. Tian Fen replied," Fortunately the world is at peace now so that I,as a relative of the imperial house, can enjoy music, horses, hounds and my estate. I am fond of musicians, actors and craftsmen,unlike Dou Ying and Guan Fu who day and night gather adventurers and powerful men from all parts of the land to plot together,taunting and slandering others behind their backs, searching the heavens for omens and sketching their plans of campaign on the ground, manoeuvring between the emperor and empress dowager, and hoping for unrest so that can achieve great deeds. I cannot tell what Dou Ying and that crew are up to." The emperor asked his ministers," Which of these two is right?" The grand secretary Han Anguo said," Dou Ying, the marquis of Weiqi, has told us how Guan Fu after his father's death seized his spear and, blind to danger, charged the ranks of Wu. He received a dozen wounds and his fame spread throughout the army as one of the bravest fighters in all the land. Now he has committed no serious crime in simply brawling over a cup of wine, and we should not execute him for other faults. In this respect, the marquis of Weiqi is right. "The prime minister, however, tells us that Guan Fu is in league with evil men, has oppressed the common people, amassed millions, tyrannized over Yingchuan, and even insulted members of the imperial house, encroaching upon their rights. When the branch is larger than the trunk, it will destroy the tree unless it is broken off. Thus the prime minister is also right. Only our sagacious sovereign can decide between them.” Ji An, the officer in charge of principalities, spoke in favour of Dou Ying. The city prefect, Zheng Dangshi, spoke up for him too but dared not make out a strong case. All the others were afraid to speak at all. The emperor was angry and swore at Zheng Dangshi,"You usually have plenty to say about the good points and bad of Dou Ying and Tian Fen. Yet in a debate at court you are like a pony caught be- tween shafts. I should have the lot of you beheaded." Emperor Wu dismissed the court and went to the inner apartments to offer food to the empress dowager. But her spies had already told her about the debate and she was too angry to eat. "Even while I am alive they are trampling on my younger brother!" she scolded. "As soon as I am dead they will swallow him up! And do you expect to last as long as a stone statue? If you give way so meekly in your lifetime, after your death which one of these men can be trusted?” The emperor apologized and said, "It is because they are both related to the imperial house that I had this debate in court. Otherwise such matters could be decided by any law officer." Then Shijian, chief of the palace guards, analysed the two men's cases for the emperor.

武安已罢朝，出止车门,召韩御史大夫载，怒曰：“与长孺共一老秃翁,何为首鼠两端?”韩御史良久谓丞相曰：“君何不自喜?夫魏其毁君，君当免冠解印绶归，曰‘臣以肺腑幸得待罪,固非其任，魏其言皆是'。如此，上必多君有让，不废君。魏其必内愧，杜门蜡舌自杀。今人毁君，君亦毁人，譬如贾竖女子争言，何其无大体也!”武安谢罪曰：“争时急，不知出此。”
田蚡退朝以后，从止车门出来，招呼韩安国上了他的车子，怒气冲冲地说：“我跟你共同对付一个老秃头，你为什么这么模棱两可，畏首畏尾呢?”韩安国沉默了一会儿才对田蚡说：“您为什么不知道自重呢?当魏其侯攻击您的时候您应当摘下帽子，把您的印绶交还皇上，您可以说：‘我只因为是皇上的亲戚才一时充当了丞相，我本来就担当不了这样的重任，魏其侯说的那些话都对。’这样一来，皇上一定会赞扬您的谦让，绝不会剥夺您的相位。而魏其侯在这种情况下也一定会深感内疚，会羞得他回去关上门子咬烂舌头自杀。可是您呢，人家攻击您，您也攻击人家，就如同小商贩、老娘们那样在那里争吵，怎么就这么不识大体呢?”田蚡一听恍然大悟说：“当时只顾了争吵，没有想到该这么做。”
When the court was dismissed Tian Fen went to find his carriage at the gate and made the grand secretary Han Anguo ride with him. “What made you dither like a mouse poking his head out of his hole when dealing with that old bald pate?" he demanded angrily. After a considerable silence Han Anguo replied, "Why couldn't you keep your temper? When Dou Ying attacked you, you should have taken off your official cap and seal and handed in your resignation, saying,' As a relative of the imperial family I have had the privilege of serving Your Majesty but proved unworthy of my post. The marquis of Weiqi is right.' The emperor would not have accepted your modesty so much that he would not have accepted your resignation, while Dou Ying would have been so ashamed that he would have locked himself up, bitten out his tongue and taken his own life. Instead, you hurled back abuse when he abused you as if this were a squabble be- tween hawkers or women. It was most undignified.” Tian Fen excused himself, saying, "In the heat of the moment that never occurred to me."

于是上使御史簿责魏其所言灌夫，颇不雠，欺谩。劾系都司空。孝景时，魏其常受遗诏,曰“事有不便，以便宜论上”。及系，灌夫罪至族，事日急，诸公莫敢复明言于上。魏其乃使昆弟子上书言之，幸得复召见。书奏上，而案尚书，大行无遗诏。诏书独藏魏其家，家丞封。乃劾魏其矫先帝诏,罪当弃市。五年十月,悉论灌夫及家属。魏其良久乃闻，闻即恚，病痱,不食欲死。或闻上无意杀魏其，魏其复食，治病，议定不死矣。乃有蜚语为恶言闻上,故以十二月晦论弃市渭城。
于是武帝派御史拿着案卷去责问窦婴，说他所讲的灌夫的情况，与事实不符，说他是欺骗皇上。于是窦婴受到弹劾也被关进了都司空的监牢里。早在孝景帝在世时，窦婴曾得到过孝景帝的一篇遗诏，其中说“当发生了什么不利的事情时，可以直接向皇上启奏”。等到魏其侯被关于起来，灌夫被判为灭族的时候，事情非常紧急，朝廷里的大臣们谁也不敢再去向皇上说明事情的真相了。这时窦婴就让他的侄子给武帝上奏，说了他家存有先帝遗诏的事情，希望得到皇上的召见。奏章交给武帝后，武帝派人到尚书处查阅案卷，没有发现景帝遗诏的存根。只有一张诏书藏在窦婴的家中，是由他们的家臣加印封存的。于是田蚡等又进而弹劾窦婴假造先帝的遗诏，罪该杀头。于是在元光五年十月，灌夫及其整个家族全部被处死。窦婴在监狱里过了很久才听到这个消息，他一听说悲痛欲绝，当时就中了风，而且绝食准备自杀。后来又听说皇上没有杀窦婴的意思，于是就又开始吃饭，请医生给自己治病，后来果然传出消息说是朝廷议定不杀窦婴了。可是紧接着又腾起一股恶毒的流言蜚语传到了皇帝那里，于是在这一年的十二月三十，魏其侯窦婴在渭城被弃市了。
The emperor ordered the censorate to verify Dou Ying's state- ments about Guan Fu, and when these were found to be untrue he was impeached and imprisoned by the gaoler of the imperial clan. During the reign of Emperor Jing, Dou Ying had received an imperial decree saying that any serious offence he might have committed should be dealt with leniently when tried. Now that he was in prison and Guan Fu had been arrested and condemned to death with his whole family, the situation was growing daily more ominous, yet nobody dared to intercede with the emperor. So Dou Ying made his brother’s son mention the decree he had received, thus hoping to have an audience with the emperor. But the imperial secretariat could find no such decree left by the previous emperor at the time of his death. The only copy was that in the possession of Dou Ying, sealed by his family steward. Accordingly he was charged with forging an imperial decree, a capital offence. In the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuanguang, Guan Fu and all his family were executed. When Dou Ying subsequently learned of this, he was so enraged that he had an epileptic fit and tried to starve himself to death. But hearing that Emperor Wu did not mean to kill him, he started eating and taking medicine again. It had been decided that his life should be spared, but then a rumour reached the emperor to the effect that Dou Ying was slandering him. He was therefore condemned to be executed at the end of the twelfth month in Weicheng.

其春,武安侯病，专呼服谢罪。使巫视鬼者视之，见魏其、灌夫共守，欲杀之。竟死。子恬嗣。元朔三年,武安侯坐衣檐榆入宫,不敬。
也就在这同一年的春天，田蚡也生了病，他一个劲地呼叫着“我有罪我服罪”。待至请来巫师一看，巫师说他看见魏其侯和灌夫两个鬼魂夹守在他的两旁，是这两个鬼魂想要弄死他。结果田蚡就这样地死去了。田蚡的儿子田恬继承了武安侯的爵位。到元朔三年时，田恬因为穿着短衫进宫，犯了不敬之罪，封邑被废除。
The following spring Tian Fen fell ill and kept crying out to beg forgiveness for his crimes. A sorcerer who could see spirits was sent for, and he saw the ghosts of Dou Ying and Guan Fu watching over Tian Fen and waiting for a chance to kill him.And so he died. His son Tian Tian succeeded to his title. In the winter of the third year of Yuanshuo, this second marquis of Wuan was found guilty of disrespect to the throne because he wore a short tunic to the palace. Thereupon the fief was abolished.

淮南王安谋反觉,治。王前朝,武安侯为太尉，时迎王至霸上,谓王曰：“上未有太子，大王最贤，高祖孙，即宫车晏驾，非大王立当谁哉!”淮南王大喜，厚遗金财物。上自魏其时不直武安,特为太后故耳。及闻淮南王金事，上曰：“使武安侯在者，族矣。”
后来淮南王刘安的谋反被发觉，武帝命令严加追究。这时才发现刘安前些年进京朝贡时，武安侯当时正做太尉，在他到霸上迎接刘安时，曾对刘安说：“现在皇上还没有太子，您为人贤明，又是高祖的孙子，假如皇上有一天死了，那时不立您还去立谁呢!"刘安听了很高兴，送给了田蚡许多金银财物。另外武帝本人也是早从窦婴被杀时就不认为田蚡有理，只不过是由于太后偏袒而不能处置他罢了。等到这回一听说田蚡接受过淮南王的贿赂时，就说：“假使武安侯现在还活着，一定要灭了他满门。”
After the prince of Huainan's plot to rebel was discovered and investigated it emerged that previously, when he had come to court, Tian Fen, then grand marshal, had welcomed him at Bashang." The emperor has no heir and Your Highness is the ablest of the First Emperor's grandsons," said Tian Fen." When the emperor dies, you should naturally succeed him.” The prince was so pleased that he presented Tian Fen with much gold and other gifts. Emperor Wu had been prejudiced against Tian Fen ever since he destroyed Dou Ying and had only put up with him for the sake of the empress dowager. When he heard about these gifts from the prince of Huainan, he declared, "If Tian Fen were still alive today I should have executed him and all his family.”

太史公曰：魏其、武安皆以外戚重，灌夫用一时决策而名 显。魏其之举以吴、楚，武安之贵在日月之际。然魏其诚不知时 变，灌夫无术而不逊，两人相翼，乃成祸乱。武安负贵而好权， 杯酒责望，陷彼两贤。呜呼哀哉!迁怒及人，命亦不延。众庶不 载，竟被恶言。呜呼哀哉!祸所从来矣!
太史公说：魏其侯、武安侯都是靠外戚的身份而得以显贵 的，灌夫因为偶然的一次冒险决断而名声显赫。魏其侯是因为 吴、楚之乱得以提升，武安侯则是利用了太后和皇上共同掌权的 机会而得以显贵。然而魏其侯太不懂得时势的变化，灌夫又不学 无术，不知谦逊，这两个人相互翼护，于是酿成大祸。武安侯倚 仗显贵的地位而喜好权势，为了一杯酒的怨气，就陷害了两个有 才能的人。唉，可惜呀!因小事迁怒别人，自己的性命也一定不能 长久。广大民众不支持，终于受到恶言中伤。唉，太可悲了!灾祸 就是这样来的啊!
The Grand Historian comments: Both Dou Ying and Tian Fen rose to power because they were reated to an empress. Guan Fu won fame for a single daring exploit, Dou Ying was promoted after the rebellion of Wu and Chu, and Tian Fen became prominent at a time when the emperor was young and the empress dowager wielded power. But Dou Ying did not know how to change with the times, while Guan Fuwas overbearing and tactless. Each, byaiding the other, brought calamity on himself. Tian Fen took advantage of his high position to display his power, destroying two good men because of a quarrel over a cup of wine. The pity of it! One who vents his anger on an innocent party will not long survive. Those who lack popular support must fall prey to slander. Alas, disaster never strikes without cause!
