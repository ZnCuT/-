樗里子者,名疾，秦惠王之弟也,与惠王异母。母，韩女也。樗里子滑稽多智,秦人号曰“智囊”。
樗里子名疾，是秦惠王的弟弟，但不是同一个母亲生的。樗里子的母亲是韩国人。樗里子为人滑稽幽默，又富有智谋，所以秦国人就给他起了个绰号，叫做“智囊”。
Shuli Zi, whose personal name was Ji, was a younger brother of King Hui of Qin by a different mother, his mother being from the state of Hann. Shuli Zi was a man of great wit and wisdom and the people of Qin dubbed him Wisdom Bag.

秦惠王八年,爵樗里子右更。使将而伐曲沃,尽出其人,取其城，地入秦。秦惠王二十五年,使樗里子为将伐赵，虏赵将军庄豹,拔蔺。明年,助魏章攻楚,败楚将屈丐,取汉中地四。秦封樗里子，号为严君。
秦惠王八年，樗里子被任为右更。秦王派他率兵去攻打魏国的曲沃，他把曲沃那一带的魏国军民全部赶走，占领了那里的土地和城市。秦惠王二十五年，秦王又派樗里子率军伐赵，活捉了赵国的将领庄豹，夺取了蔺县。第二年，又协助魏章一起伐楚，打败了楚国的大将屈丐，占领了原属楚国的汉中地区。由于功大，樗里子被封为严君。
In King Hui’s eighth year (330 BC) Shuli Zi was awarded the rank of yougeng126 and ordered to lead the troops in an attack on the city of Quwo. He seized the city, expelled its inhabitants, and handed it over to Qin. In King Hui’s twenty-fifth year (313 BC) Shuli Zi was ordered to lead an attack on Zhao. He took the Zhao general Zhuang Bao prisoner and captured the region of Lin. The following year he assisted Wei Zhang in attacking Chu, defeating the Chu general Qu Gai and seizing the region of Hanzhong. Qin enfeoffed Shuli Zi with the title of Lord Yan.

秦惠王卒，太子武王立,逐张仪、魏章,而以樗里子、甘茂为左右丞相。秦使甘茂攻韩，拔宜阳@。使樗里子以车百乘入周。周以卒迎之,意甚敬。楚王怒,让周,以其重秦客。游腾为周说楚王曰：“知伯之伐仇犹,遗之广车,因随之以兵，仇犹遂亡。何则?无备故也。齐桓公伐蔡@,号曰诛楚，其实袭蔡。今秦，虎狼之国，使樗里子以车百乘入周，周以仇犹、蔡观焉，故使长戟居前，强弩在后，名曰卫疾，而实囚之。且夫周岂能无忧其社稷哉?恐一旦亡国以忧大王。”楚王乃悦。
秦惠王死后，太子武王即位，由于群臣挑拨，秦武王赶走了张仪和魏章，而任命樗里子、甘茂为左、右丞相。接着秦王派甘茂率军伐韩，夺取了宜阳。然后又派樗里子带着一百辆车去朝见周天子。周天子派士兵列队迎接，表现得非常恭敬。这样一来，楚王很不高兴了，他对周天子提出了责备，问他为什么对秦国的使臣这么尊宠。这时游腾就自告奋勇去楚国对楚王解释说：“当初知伯为了要打仇犹那个小国，就故意先送给他们好几大车东西，接着就派去了军队，仇犹就是这么灭亡的。为什么呢?就是因为解除了他们的防备。齐桓公目的是伐蔡，而口头上却说去讨伐楚国，结果把蔡国偷袭了。今天的秦国，简直像虎狼一样的凶狠，他们派樗里子带了这么多车辆到周国来，周天子是吸取了仇犹、蔡国的教训所以才派了许多手持长矛、硬弩的士兵前呼后拥着他，这么做表面上说是保卫樗里子，实际上是把他囚禁了起来。再说，难道周国自己就不考虑自己国家的安危吗?我们也是怕万一国家出了什么事情给您添麻烦。”这么一说，楚王也就高兴了。
When King Hui of Qin died and the heir apparent, King Wu, was set up (310 BC), Zhang Yi and Wei Zhang were dismissed from office and Shuli Zi and Gan Mou appointed as chancellor of the right and left respectively. Qin dispatched Gan Mou to attack Hann and capture the city of Yiyang. Shuli Zi was ordered to proceed with an entourage of 100 carriages to the Zhou capital. The Zhou ruler sent out soldiers to greet him and treated him with great respect. The king of Chu, angered by this, berated the Zhou king for according Qin’s representative such high honour. But You Teng, a visitor from another state, spoke to the king of Chu on Zhou’s behalf, saying, “When Zhi Bo attacked the state of Jiuyou, he first sent in broad wagons and then followed them up with troops, and so Jiuyou was destroyed. Why? Because it was not on its guard. When Duke Huan of Qi attacked the state of Cai, he said, ‘I’m punishing Chu!’ but in fact he pounced on Cai. Now Qin, a country of tigers and wolves, has sent Shuli Zi with an entourage of 100 carriages to visit the Zhou capital. But Zhou recalls the fate of Jiuyou and Cai. Therefore it has long lances going before him, and strong crossbows bringing up the rear. In name it is ‘guarding him’, but in fact it has made him its prisoner. How could Zhou fail to be concerned for its altars of the soil and grain? Indeed, if it should one morning go out of existence, that would be a worry even to Your Majesty!” With this the king of Chu’s anger gave way to delight.

秦武王卒,昭王立,樗里子又益尊重。昭王元年,樗里子将伐蒲。蒲守恐，请胡衍。胡衍为蒲谓樗里子曰：“公之攻蒲，为秦乎?为魏乎?为魏则善矣，为秦则不为赖矣。夫卫之所以为卫者,以蒲也。今伐蒲入于秦，卫必折而从魏。魏亡西河之外而无以取者,兵弱也。今并卫于魏，魏必强。魏强之日，西河之外必危矣。且秦王将观公之事，害秦而利魏，王必罪公。”樗里子曰：“奈何?”胡衍曰：“公释蒲勿攻，臣试为公入言之，以德卫君。”樗里子曰：“善。”胡衍入蒲，谓其守曰：“樗里子知蒲之病矣,其言曰必拔蒲。衍能令释蒲勿攻。”蒲守恐，因再拜曰：“愿以请。”因效金三百斤，曰：“秦兵苟退，请必言子于卫君，使子为南面。”故胡衍受金于蒲以自贵于卫。于是遂解蒲而去。还击皮氏,皮氏未降，又去。
秦武王死后，昭王即位，樗里子比过去更受尊敬了。昭王元年，樗里子准备率兵攻取卫国的蒲城。蒲城的守将很害怕，请胡衍给他出主意，于是胡衍就去对樗里子说：“您准备攻打蒲城，这是为了秦国呢?还是为了魏国呢?如果是为了魏国，这当然是不错的；如果要是为了秦国，恐怕那就没有什么好处了。今天卫国之所以还能存在，就是因为它还有蒲城。如今您攻打蒲城，蒲城一归秦国，那么整个卫国就要折而投向魏国去了。魏国当初丢失了西河以外的土地一直夺不回来，不就是因为兵力弱吗?现在您把卫国推向它，它的势力立刻就强大了起来。魏国一强大，你们原先占领的西河以外就很难保得住了。再说你们秦王也时时刻刻地在那里看着您，如果您做的事情对秦国有害而对魏有利，那他肯定是不会饶过您的。”樗里子说：“那你看怎么办呢?”胡衍说：“您应该放弃攻打蒲城的计划，我可以替您到卫国去说说，让您能在卫君的面前落好。”樗里子说：“好吧!”于是胡衍进了蒲城，对蒲城的守将说：“樗里子已经知道你们蒲城的困境了，他说他非要打下蒲城不可。可是我却能让他饶过你们不打。”蒲城的守将一听很害怕，一再地向他行礼说：“无论如何请您帮忙。”并拿出了三百斤金子给胡衍，说：“如果您能让秦兵撤退，我一定把您推荐给卫君，让卫君也分给您一块领地。”最后这件事情的结果是使得胡衍既在蒲城得到了黄金，又在卫国得到了显贵。樗里子的军队从蒲城撤走了，回去的途中又打了一下魏国的皮氏，结果也没有打下来，樗里子只好空手回去了。
When King Wu of Qin died and was succeeded by King Zhaoxiang, Shuli Zi was treated with even greater respect than before. In the first year of King Zhaoxiang (306 BC) Shuli Zi led an attack on the city of Pu. The defenders of Pu, fearful of the outcome, requested Hu Yan to speak to Shuli Zi on Pu’s behalf. Hu Yan said to Shuli Zi, “Are you attacking Pu for the sake of Qin, or for the sake of Wei? If it is for the sake of Wei, that is fine. But if it is for the sake of Qin, then your efforts are misdirected. “The reason the state of Wey can continue to exist is because of Pu. Now if you attack Pu, it will turn for help to Wei, and if it does so, then Wey is certain to give in and follow suit. In the past Wei lost the territories it held west of the Yellow River to your state, and it has not been able to regain them because it is weak in military might. But now if Wey throws in its lot with Wei, then Wei will become strong. And the day Wei becomes strong, your territories west of the Yellow River are bound to be threatened. Moreover, the king of Qin will be watching your every move, and if you injure Qin’s interests to benefit Wei, he is certain to call you to account!” “Then what should I do?” said Shuli Zi. Hu Yan replied, “Call off your troops and cease the attack on Pu. I will enter the city and try speaking to the inhabitants for you so that the ruler of Wey will benefit.” “Excellent!” said Shuli Zi. Hu Yan then entered Pu and addressed its defenders, saying, “Shuli Zi knows that you are hard pressed and says that he is certain to capture the city. But I can make him cease his attack and leave Pu alone!” The defenders of Pu, terrified, bowed twice and said, “We beg you to do all you can!” Then they offered him 300 catties of gold, saying, “If the Qin troops withdraw, we will surely recommend you to the ruler of Wey and see that you are given a fief.” Hu Yan thereupon took the gold from the men of Pu and used it to win himself a position of honour in Wey. Shuli Zi ceased his attack on Pu and left, withdrawing and attacking the Wei city of Pishi instead, but when Pishi failed to surrender, he left that as well.

昭王七年,樗里子卒，葬于渭南章台之东。曰：“后百岁，是当有天子之宫夹我墓。”樗里子疾室在于昭王庙西渭南阴乡樗里,故俗谓之樗里子。至汉兴，长乐宫在其东,未央宫在其西,武库正直其墓。秦人谚曰：“力则任鄙,智则樗里。”
昭王七年，樗里子去世，葬在了渭水南岸的章台东面。临死前他说：“我死后一百年，将会有天子的宫殿在我的坟墓两旁矗立起来。”当时樗里子的住处是在昭王庙西，渭水南岸的阴乡樗里，所以人们称他为樗里子。待至汉朝建国后，果然长乐宫盖在了他坟墓的东面，未央宫盖在了他坟墓的西面，储藏兵器的仓库盖在了他坟墓的正南面。于是当时秦地的人们有句谚语说：“力气大的数任鄙，智谋高的数樗里。”
In the seventh year of King Zhaoxiang (300 BC), Shuli Zi died. He was buried east of the Zhang Terrace on the south side of the Wei River. He said, “A hundred years from now there will be palaces of the Son of Heaven flanking my grave on either side.” Shuli Zi’s house was situated west of the mortuary temple of King Zhaoxiang, in the village of Shuli Zi or the Gentleman of Shuli. Later, when the Han dynasty arose, the Palace of Lasting Joy was situated to the east of his grave and the Eternal Palace to the west, while the arsenal was directly in front of it. The people of Qin used to say: “For strength, Ren Bi; for wisdom, Shuli.”

甘茂者，下蔡人也。事下蔡史举先生,学百家之术。因张仪、樗里子而求见秦惠王。王见而说之，使将，而佐魏章略定汉中地。
甘茂是下蔡人，曾经跟着下蔡的史举先生学习诸子百家的著作。后来在张仪和樗里子的引见下，见到了秦惠王。秦惠王很喜欢他，让他做了秦国的将军，协助魏章一起平定了汉中地区。
Gan Mou was a native of Xiacai in Chu. He studied under Master Shi Ju of Xiacai, learning the theories of the hundred schools of philosophy. He requested Zhang Yi and Shuli Zi to arrange an interview for him with King Hui of Qin. The king granted the request and, pleased with him, made him a general and ordered him to assist Wei Zhang in invading and gaining control of the region of Hanzhong.

惠王卒，武王立。张仪、魏章去，东之魏。蜀侯辉、相壮反,秦使甘茂定蜀。还，而以甘茂为左丞相@,以樗里子为右丞相。秦武王三年,谓甘茂曰：“寡人欲容车通三川,以窥周室,而寡人死不朽矣。”甘茂曰：“请之魏，约以伐韩,而令向寿辅行。”甘茂至,谓向寿曰：“子归，言之于王曰‘魏听臣矣，然愿王勿伐’。事成，尽以为子功。”向寿归，以告王，王迎甘茂于息壤。甘茂至，王问其故。对曰：“宜阳，大县也，上党、南阳积之久矣。名曰县，其实郡也。今王倍数险,行千里攻之，难。昔曾参之处费,鲁人有与曾参同姓名者杀人，人告其母曰‘曾参杀人’,其母织自若也。顷之，一人又告之曰‘曾参杀人’,其母尚织自若也。顷又一人告之曰‘曾参杀人’,其母投杼下机，逾墙而走。夫以曾参之贤与其母之信也,三人疑之”,其母惧焉。今臣之贤不若曾参，王之信臣又不如曾参之母信曾参也，疑臣者非特三人,臣恐大王之投杼也。始张仪西并巴蜀之地,北开西河之外，南取上庸,天下不以多张子而以贤先王。魏文侯令乐羊将而攻中山，三年而拔之。乐羊返而论功，文侯示之谤书一箧。乐羊再拜稽首曰：‘此非臣之功也，主君之力也。’今臣，羁旅之臣也。樗里子、公孙奭二人者挟韩而议之，王必听之，是王欺魏王而臣受公仲侈之怨也。”王曰：“寡人不听也，请与子盟。”卒使丞相甘茂将兵伐宜阳。五月而不拔，樗里子、公孙奭果争之。武王召甘茂，欲罢兵。甘茂曰：“息壤在彼。”王曰：“有之。”因大悉起兵，使甘茂击之。斩首六万，遂拔宜阳。韩襄王使公仲侈入谢,与秦平。
惠王死后，武王即位，张仪、魏章都相继离开了秦国，到魏国去了。这时正遇上蜀侯辉和蜀相壮发动叛乱，于是秦王就派甘茂前去稳定局势。事成回来后，甘茂被任为左丞相，右丞相由樗里子担任。秦武王三年，秦王对甘茂说：“我什么时候能坐着轿车到三川一带去看看周国的形势，那时我就死也瞑目了。”甘茂说：“请让我去魏国，约它们去一起伐韩。请您叫向寿陪我一道去。”甘茂刚到魏国后，就对向寿说：“您现在就回去对秦王说：‘魏国已经听从甘茂的话了，但是甘茂希望大王不要再发兵攻打韩国。'您就这样去说，将来事情办成后，功劳全归您。”向寿回到秦国，把甘茂的话转告给了秦王，秦王一听立即亲自来到了息壤让甘茂前来相见。甘茂来到后，秦王问他为什么变卦，甘茂说：“我们想要攻打韩国的宜阳，那可是个大县城，上党和南阳的物资长期以来都贮藏在那里。那里名义上是个县城，实际上相当于一个郡城。现在您想跨过许多险要的地段，千里跋涉地打它，那是很难的。当初曾参家在费县，鲁国有个和曾参同名的人杀了人，有人跑来对曾参的母亲说：‘你儿子曾参杀人了。’他母亲听了继续织布不止，根本不相信。过了一会儿，又有一个人来对她说：‘你儿子曾参杀人了。’她还是照常织布，不理他。过了一会儿，又有一个人来对她说：‘你儿子曾参杀人了。'曾参的母亲一听就扔下了梭子，跳墙就跑。有曾参那样的品质，有母亲对儿子的信任，结果三个人的谣言，还把他的母亲吓成了那样。现在我的品质比不上曾参，大王相信我的程度也比不上曾参母亲对她儿子的信任，而怀疑我给我造谣言的人又绝不止三个，我是害怕有朝一日您也会像曾参母亲那样听信谣言，吓得扔掉织梭跳墙就跑。再比如说，当初张仪为我们向西吞并了巴蜀，向北开拓了西河以外，向南夺取了上庸，当时普天下的人们主要的不是称赞张仪的才干而是歌颂先王的英明。魏文侯派乐羊带兵攻打中山国，三年后把中山灭掉了。当乐羊胜利回朝论功行赏的时候，魏文侯给他拿出了一箱子毁谤他的书信。乐羊一看深有感慨地对文侯说：‘由此看来，能够灭掉中山这不是我的功劳，而是全靠大王的大力支持了。'我现在只不过是一个漂泊异乡的客人，如果樗里子和公孙奭这两个人站在韩国的立场上一发议论，您肯定就会听信他们而改变主意，这样一来您就背叛了魏王，而我也将要受到韩相公仲侈的怨恨。”秦王说：“我决不会听他们的话，我可以和你立下誓约!”就这样，秦王派甘茂领兵去攻打韩国的宜阳了。待至连续攻了五个月还没有攻下来，这时樗里子和公孙爽果然出来拦阻了。秦武王召见甘茂，想叫他撤兵。甘茂说：“当初我们在息壤立下的誓辞不是还在那里放着吗?”秦王醒悟了，说：“是的。”于是就增派大兵，让甘茂领着去攻打宜阳。结果大获全胜，杀死韩军六万人，宜阳也被秦国占领了。韩襄王无奈只好派宰相公仲侈到秦国请罪，与秦国订立了条约。
When King Hui died and King Wu came to the throne (330 BC) Zhang Yi and Wei Zhang left Qin and went east to Wei. Zhuang, the prime minister to Hui, the marquis of Shu, revolted. Qin ordered Gan Mou to restore order in Shu. On his return, Gan Mou was appointed chancellor of the left, with Shuli Zi as chancellor of the right. In the third year of his rule King Wu said to Gan Mou, “I want to send my war chariots through the region of the three rivers and call on the Zhou royal house. Then though I die my name will never perish.”127 Gan Mou said, “If I may have permission to go to Wei, I will get Wei to promise to join us in an attack on Hann.” The king instructed Xiang Shou to accompany Gan Mou to Wei. When they arrived in Wei, Gan Mou said to Xiang Shou, “Please go back and tell the king that Wei has agreed to my proposal, but ask him not to carry out the attack. Once the affair is successfully completed, I will give all the credit to you.” Xiang Shou returned and made his report to King Wu. The king went as far as Xirang to meet Gan Mou. When Gan Mou arrived, the king asked his reason for abandoning the attack. Gan Mou replied, “Yiyang is a major district, and Shangdang and Nanyang have for a long time been stocked with supplies. In name they are districts, but in fact they amount to provinces. Now if Your Majesty were to make your way over numerous passes, journeying 1,000 li, it would be difficult to attack them. “Long ago, when the philosopher Zeng Can was living in Bi, an inhabitant of Lu who had the same surname and given name as Zeng Can killed a man. Someone came to Zeng Can’s mother and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!’ but his mother went on weaving just as before. After a while someone else came and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!’ but still his mother went on with her weaving. After a while, however, when a third person came and said, ‘Zeng Can killed a man!’, his mother dropped her shuttle, scrambled down from the loom, climbed over the wall and ran away. Worthy as Zeng Can was, and as much as his mother trusted him, when three people cast suspicion on him, even his mother became frightened. “Now my worth is no match for Zeng Can’s, and no ruler trusts his ministers the way Zeng Can’s mother trusted her son. So it would hardly take three people to make Your Majesty begin doubting me. I am afraid, that is, that you may ‘drop the shuttle’. “In the past, when Zhang Yi marched west to annex the regions of Ba and Shu for Qin, when in the north he opened up the lands beyond the Yellow River and in the south seized Shangyong, the world did not count it to Zhang Yi’s credit but rather praised the wisdom of King Hui, the former ruler of Qin. And there was the time when Marquis Wen of Wei ordered Yue Yang to lead an attack on Zhongshan. After three years he managed to conquer it. But when he returned and his merit was being discussed, Marquis Wen showed him a box full of letters criticizing him, and Yue Yang, bowing his head twice, said, ‘The victory was due to no merit of mine, but to the might of our lord and ruler!’ “Now I have journeyed to Qin from a foreign state to take up office. If two men such as Shuli Zi and Gongsun Shi should side with Hann and criticize my plan for attacking it, then Your Majesty would be certain to heed them. In that case you would be accused of going back on your word to Wei, and I would incur the hatred of the Hann prime minister Gongzhong Chi.” The king said, “I will not listen to such men! I will swear an oath with you!” So in the end he ordered the chancellor Gan Mou to lead the troops in an attack on Yiyang. Five months passed and Gan Mou had not captured the city when, as he had feared, Shuli Zi and Gongsun Shi began criticizing him. King Wu sent a summons to Gan Mou, intending to abandon the attack, but Gan Mou replied, “We swore an oath at Xirang!” “I remember!” said the king, and he proceeded to call out all his forces and order Gan Mou to press the attack. Gan Mou cut off 60,000 enemy heads and in the end captured Yiyang. King Xiang of Hann ordered Gongzhong Chi to journey to Qin with his apologies and conclude a peace agreement with Qin.

武王竟至周,而卒于周。其弟立，为昭王。王母宣太后，楚女也。楚怀王怨前秦败楚于丹阳而韩不救,乃以兵围韩雍氏。韩使公仲侈告急于秦。秦昭王新立，太后楚人，不肯救。公仲因甘茂,茂为韩言于秦昭王曰：“公仲方有得秦救，故敢扞楚也。今雍氏围，秦师不下殽,公仲且仰首而不朝,公叔且以国南合于楚。楚、韩为一，魏氏不敢不听，然则伐秦之形成矣。不识坐而待伐孰与伐人之利?”秦王曰：“善。”乃下师于殽以救韩，楚兵去。
秦武王终于踏上了周国的地面，而且还是死在了周国的首都王城。秦武王的弟弟继承了王位，这就是秦昭王。昭王的母亲宣太后，是楚国人。而楚怀王由于记恨着当年楚国在丹阳被秦国打败而韩国不发兵援救的事，因而发兵包围了韩国的雍氏。韩国派宰相公仲侈到秦国求救。当时秦昭王刚刚即位，太后又是楚国人，所以不肯出兵救韩。公仲侈灵机一动就去找甘茂，于是甘茂对秦昭王说：“公仲侈是因为估量着能够得到秦国的援助，所以才敢抵抗楚国。现在雍氏被楚国包围了，而秦兵却不愿东出崤山去救援，这样就会使得公仲侈掉过头来不再朝拜秦国，而带着他的国家南去归附楚国。而楚国和韩国一联合，魏国也就不敢不听它们的，这样，东方各国联合伐秦的形势就形成了。不知道等着日后被人所伐和今天去主动伐人这两种办法哪一种好?”秦王说：“你说得对。”于是立刻派兵东出崤山救援韩国。楚国一见秦国出兵，就自动把围困雍氏的军队撤回去了。
King Wu in the end journeyed to the Zhou capital and died there. He was succeeded by his younger brother, King Zhaoxiang. The king’s mother, Queen Dowager Xuan, was a woman of Chu. King Huai of Chu deeply resented the fact that, when he had been defeated by Qin at Danyang, the state of Hann had failed to come to his rescue. He now sent troops to surround the Hann city of Yongshi. Hann dispatched Gongzhong Chi to report its distress to Qin. King Zhaoxiang, however, had just become ruler, and since his mother was a woman of Chu, he did not dare go to Hann’s assistance. Gongzhong Chi then requested Gan Mou to speak on Hann’s behalf to the king of Qin. Gan Mou addressed King Zhaoxiang in these words: “Gongzhong Chi at present believes that Qin will come to the rescue of Hann, and therefore he ventures to hold out against Chu. But now, although Hann’s city of Yongshi is besieged, Qin’s troops do not advance beyond the Yao Pass. If Gongzhong Chi is thus placed in a difficult position, he will no longer be able to face the Hann court. And then his rival, Gongshu, may decide that Hann should face south and throw in its lot with Chu. In that case Chu and Hann will become allies, and Wei will not dare do otherwise than follow suit. Then the circumstances will be ripe for a concerted attack on Qin. Which is better, to sit by and wait for others to attack, or to take the initiative in attacking others?” “Very well,” said the king, and he ordered his troops to advance from Yao and go to the aid of Hann, whereupon the Chu forces withdrew.

秦使向寿平宜阳,而使樗里子、甘茂伐魏皮氏。向寿者，宣太后外族也,而与昭王少相长,故任用。向寿如楚,楚闻秦之贵向寿，而厚事向寿。向寿为秦守宜阳，将以伐韩。韩公仲使苏代谓向寿曰:“禽困覆车。公破韩，辱公仲,公仲收国复事秦，自以为必可以封。今公与楚解口地,封小令尹以杜阳。秦楚合，复攻韩，韩必亡。韩亡，公仲且躬率其私徒以阏于秦。愿公孰虑之也。”向寿曰：“吾合秦楚非以当韩也,子为寿谒之公仲,曰秦韩之交可合也。”苏代对曰：“愿有谒于公。人曰‘贵其所以贵者贵’。王之爱习公也,不如公孙奭；其智能公也,不如甘茂。今二人者皆不得亲于秦事,而公独与王主断于国者何?彼有以失之也。公孙奭党于韩，而甘茂党于魏，故王不信也。今秦楚争强而公党于楚，是与公孙奭、甘茂同道也，公何以异之?人皆言楚之善变也,而公必亡之,是自为责也。公不如与王谋其变也,善韩以备楚,如此则无患矣。韩氏必先以国从公孙奭而后委国于甘茂。韩，公之仇也“。今公言善韩以备楚，是外举不僻仇也。”向寿曰：“然，吾甚欲韩合。”对曰：“甘茂许公仲以武遂，反宜阳之民,今公徒收之，甚难。”向寿曰：“然则奈何?武遂终不可得也?”对曰：“公奚不以秦为韩求颖川于楚?此韩之寄地也。公求而得之，是令行于楚而以其地德韩也。公求而不得，是韩楚之怨不解而交走秦也。秦楚争强，而公徐过楚以收韩,此利于秦。”向寿曰：“奈何?”对曰：“此善事也的。甘茂欲以魏取齐,公孙奭欲以韩取齐。今公取宜阳以为功，收楚、韩以安之,而诛齐、魏之罪，是以公孙奭、甘茂无事也。”
接着秦王一方面派向寿东去宜阳进一步稳定那里的局面，同时又派樗里子和甘茂去攻打魏国的皮氏。向寿是宣太后的娘家人，从小和秦昭王一起长大，所以在秦国很受重用。向寿曾经去过楚国，楚国听说向寿在秦国受宠，就千方百计地拉拢他。待至这次向寿东出驻守宜阳，并准备出兵伐韩时，韩国宰相公仲侈就派苏代来对向寿说：“一只野兽被逼急了还能够弄翻人的车子呢，过去您曾经破了韩国，侮辱了公仲侈，使得公仲侈不得不收拾国土投靠了秦国，当时他本来想到了秦国肯定是可以得到一块封地的，结果什么也没有得到，现在您又把解口给了楚国，把杜阳给了楚国的小令尹，准备再和楚国联合起来攻打韩国，那时韩国肯定就要灭亡了。如果韩国一定要灭亡，那么公仲侈肯定就会亲自带着他的一群死党来和你们作最后的一拼。希望您仔细考虑一下。”向寿说：“我让秦国和楚国联合不是为了对付韩国，请你去和公仲侈替我说说，就说韩国和秦国的联盟是可以建立的。”苏代说：“我还有话要和您讲。常言道：‘一个人必须时刻记着他今天的富贵是怎样取得的，这样他才能保住今后的富贵。'论受秦王的喜欢，您比不上公孙奭；论个人的才能，您比不上甘茂。可是他们两个人却都不能参与秦国的决策，只有您能和秦王决定国家的一切，这是为什么呢?就是因为他们都有过失。比如公孙奭是亲韩的，甘茂是亲魏的，所以秦王都不信任他们。眼下秦国正和楚国争强，而您却恰好表现为亲楚，这不是和公孙奭、甘茂走上同一条路了吗?您和他们还有什么区别呢?现在大家都说楚国是一个变化莫测的国家，而您却认为没有这回事，您这不是自己找罪吗?您不如改过来，也和秦王一道筹划对付楚国万一有变的办法，也改为拉拢韩国以防备楚国，这样一来您就没有什么危险了。再说韩国要想亲秦一定是先找公孙奭，而后是找甘茂。韩国是您的仇敌，现在您居然提出亲韩防楚的方案，就可以落一个像古人所说的‘外举不避仇’的美名啦!”向寿说：“好!我也的确是想和韩国搞好关系。”苏代说：“可是甘茂已经答应公仲侈把武遂退给韩国，让被驱逐的宜阳居民返回宜阳居住，今天您又派人去把它要回来，这不是很难办的事情吗?”向寿说：“那怎么办，难道武遂就要不回来了吗?”苏代说：“您何不以秦国的名义替韩国向楚国要潁川呢?潁川本来就是韩国的地盘让楚国占了。现在如果通过您的讲情而要了回来，那就既说明了您的话楚国不敢不听，同时又给韩国做了好事。如果您说了楚国不给，那么韩国和楚国的矛盾将会由此加深，就会都来争着投奔秦国。在这秦、楚两国争强的关键时刻，您稍微责备一下楚国而亲近一点韩国，这对秦国是有好处的。"向寿说：“为什么呢?”苏代说：“当然这是好事。因为甘茂是想依靠魏国来攻取齐国，公孙奭想依靠韩国来攻取齐国，而您现在有稳定宜阳的功劳，又能联络韩国、楚国以加固您宜阳的伟绩，而反过来再去讨伐齐国和魏国的罪过，这样一来，公孙奭和甘茂就不可能再有什么作为了。”
Qin then sent Xiang Shou to bring order to the Hann city of Yiyang, and ordered Shuli Zi and Gan Mou to attack the Wei city of Pishi. Xiang Shou was a distant relative of Queen Dowager Xuan and had grown up with King Zhaoxiang. Therefore the king employed him in this manner. Earlier, when Xiang Shou visited Chu, the king of Chu, hearing that Qin held Xiang Shou in high esteem, had accorded him a very generous reception. Now Xiang Shou was guarding the city of Yiyang for Qin and preparing to attack Hann. Gongzhong Chi of Hann sent Su Dai to speak to Xiang Shou, saying, “An animal at bay may overturn a carriage. In the past you defeated Hann and inflicted shame on Gongzhong Chi. But Gongzhong Chi has persuaded his state to enlist once more on the side of Qin, because he believes that by doing so he will surely receive a fief from Qin. “Now you have presented the Qin territory of Jiekou to Chu, and Chu has in turn enfeoffed you in Duyang with the title of a minor magistrate. But if Qin and Chu pool their forces to attack Hann again, then Hann is certain to be doomed. And if Hann is doomed, then Gongzhong Chi out of desperation will lead his own private forces in an assault on Qin. I hope you will give this careful thought!” Xiang Shou said, “In bringing Qin and Chu together as allies, I am not attempting to threaten Hann. Please tell Gongzhong Chi for me that Qin and Hann may also become allies.” Su Dai replied, “Ah, but I would like to tell you something. People say that the eminent are accorded eminence because there is something about them that merits eminence. In terms of affection and intimacy, you are not as close to the king of Qin as Gongsun Shi, and in terms of wisdom and ability, you are no match for Gan Mou. But neither of these two men is allowed to play a vital role in the affairs of Qin, while you alone join with the king in deciding upon matters of state. Why? Because there is some fault that attaches to these two. Gongsun Shi is in the party that favours Hann, and Gan Mou is in the party that favours Wei. Therefore the king does not trust them. “But now, when Qin and Chu are vying for power, if you ally yourself with the party that favours Chu, then you will be travelling the same road as Gongsun Shi and Gan Mou. How will you be any different from them? “People all say that Chu is expert at shifting sides. And if it should do so, then you will have to flee the state. And you will have brought it on yourself. It would be better, therefore, to consult with the king of Qin so as to anticipate such shifts. If you prepare against Chu’s inconstancy by befriending Hann, you can avoid difficulty. Hann first of all follows the advice of Gongsun Shi in matters of state, and as a next step entrusts itself to Gan Mou. In trusting these men in this way, it is in a sense your enemy. Therefore, when you recommend that Qin guard against Chu’s inconstancy by befriending Hann, it will appear that in foreign affairs you do not hesitate to recommend an enemy.” “All right,” said Xiang Shou. “I would like very much to join forces with Hann.” Su Dai replied, “Gan Mou has promised Gongzhong Chi that Qin will give back Wusui and let the inhabitants of Yiyang return to their city. But now with you occupying Yiyang, that is difficult to carry out.” “Then what should I do?” said Xiang Shou. “Wusui can never be given back to Hann in any case.” Su Dai replied, “Why don’t you have Qin bring pressure on Chu to return the region of Yingchuan to Hann? Hann donated it to Chu in the first place. If you make the request and it is granted, that will show how much influence you exercise over Chu, and at the same time you will be doing Hann a favour in terms of territory. And if you make the request and it is not granted, then the enmity between Chu and Hann will remain unappeased and they will compete with one another for the friendship of Qin. Now that Qin and Chu are vying for power, you can afford to be somewhat critical of Chu and thereby bring Hann over to your side. This will be to Qin’s advantage.” “How so?” said Xiang Shou. “This is a very good plan!” Su Dai replied. “Gan Mou would like to enlist the help of Wei in attacking Qi, while Gongsun Shi would like to enlist the help of Hann in attacking Qi. Now you will have gained merit by arranging a settlement in Yiyang, you will have brought both Chu and Hann over to the side of Qin, and with that assurance you may all three punish Qi and Wei for their faults. In that case Gongsun Shi and Gan Mou will be as powerless as ever.”

甘茂竟言秦昭王,以武遂复归之韩。向寿、公孙奭争之,不能得。向寿、公孙奭由此怨，谗甘茂，茂惧，辍伐魏皮氏,亡去。樗里子与魏讲，罢兵。
最终甘茂还是劝着秦昭王把武遂还给了韩国，向寿和公孙奭反对了半天，也没有起作用。从此向寿和公孙奭就开始忌恨甘茂，千方百计地诋毁他，甘茂害怕了，于是便停止了对魏国皮氏的攻击，离开了秦国。接着樗里子就去魏国讲和，两国罢兵。
Gan Mou eventually spoke to King Zhaoxiang of Qin, urging him to return the city of Wusui to Hann. Xiang Shou and Gongsun Shi opposed the move but were unable to prevent it. Angered over this, Xiang Shou and Gongsun Shi spoke slanderously of Gan Mou. Gan Mou, alarmed, ceased his attack on the Wei city of Puban and fled. Shuli Zi meanwhile concluded peace talks with Wei and withdrew his troops.

甘茂之亡秦奔齐,逢苏代。代为齐使于秦。甘茂曰：“臣得罪于秦，惧而遁逃，无所容迹。臣闻贫人女与富人女会绩,贫人女曰：‘我无以买烛，而子之烛光幸有余，子可分我余光，无损子明而得一斯使焉。’今臣困而君方使秦而当路矣。茂之妻子在焉，愿君以余光振之。”苏代许诺。遂致使于秦。已,因说秦王曰：“甘茂，非常士也。其居于秦，累世重矣。自殽塞及至鬼谷,其地形险易皆明知之。彼以齐约韩魏反以图秦，非秦之利也。”秦王曰：“然则奈何?”苏代曰：“王不若重其贽、厚其禄以迎之,使彼来则置之鬼谷,终身勿出。”秦王曰：“善。”即赐之上卿，以相印迎之于齐。甘茂不往。苏代谓齐滑王曰：“夫甘茂，贤人也。今秦赐之上卿，以相印迎之。甘茂德王之赐，好为王臣，故辞而不往。今王何以礼之?”齐王曰：“善。”即位之上卿而处之。秦因复甘茂之家以市于齐。
甘茂离开秦国后，急急往齐国逃奔，路上碰到了苏代。苏代是作为齐国的使者正要去秦国的。甘茂说：“我刚刚得罪了秦国，因为害怕而逃了出来，现在连个安身之处也没有了。我听说过这样一个故事：一个贫家女子和一个富家女子在一起纺线，贫家女子说：‘我们家没有钱买蜡烛，而你们家蜡烛能照亮好大一片地方，你们借给我一点光，对你们没有任何妨碍，而你们却凭空得到了一个仆人使唤。'眼下我就正是陷于困境，而您正好要去秦国，并在秦国说话算话。现在我的老婆孩子还在秦国，希望您能顺便帮她们一把。”苏代答应了。苏代到了秦国，办完了使臣的公事后，趁便对秦王说：“甘茂不是个一般的人，他在秦国曾一连受过好几代国君的重用。从崤山到鬼谷的这一带地形哪里险要哪里平坦，他都知道得很清楚。假如他让齐国联合韩国、魏国来一道打秦国，这对秦国来说恐怕不是件好事。”秦王说：“那怎么办呢?”苏代说：“大王不如派人带着厚礼去看他，想法用高官厚禄去骗他回来，如果他一旦回来，就把他囚禁在鬼谷，叫他一辈子也别再出来。”秦王说：“好!”马上封甘茂为上卿，并派人带着秦国的相印，到齐国去接他。但是甘茂不回去。这时苏代又去对齐潘王说：“甘茂可是个大能人!现在秦王给了他上卿的爵位，并派人带着相印来请他回去，甘茂是出于感激您的恩德，愿意为您做事，所以才不愿回去，您准备用什么礼节对待他呢?”齐王说：“好!”立刻也给了他上卿的爵位，让他安定了下来。秦国一见如此，也在秦国免除了甘茂家属的一切劳役赋税以表示不差于齐国。
When Gan Mou had fled from Qin and was hurrying toward Qi, he met Su Dai along the way. Su Dai was going to Qin on a mission for the state of Qi. Gan Mou said, “I have become a criminal in the eyes of Qin and am running away in fear of the consequences, though I am afraid no place will have me. I have heard that a poor girl and a rich girl were once spinning thread together. The poor girl said, ‘I have no money to buy a torch, but your torch gives more than enough light and some to spare. Perhaps you can lend me a spare beam. It won’t mean any less light for you, and it will be a big help to me!’ Now I am in trouble, and you happen to be on your way to a mission in Qin. My wife and children are still in Qin. Perhaps you can help me out with some of your ‘spare beams’.” Su Dai agreed to do what he could, and when he had reached Qin and completed his mission, he took the opportunity to speak to the king of Qin as follows: “Gan Mou is no ordinary man. While he resided in Qin, he held important posts under a succession of rulers. Moreover, he is thoroughly familiar with the land formations and the steep and easy places in the area from Yao Pass to Devil Valley. If he should persuade Qi to ally with Hann and Wei and should turn around and start plotting against Qin, that would hardly be to Qin’s advantage.” “But what can I do about it?” asked the king of Qin. Su Dai said, “Your Majesty would do best to treat him generously and offer him a large stipend in order to induce him to return. Then when he comes, you can established him in Acacia Valley and see that he is confined there for the rest of his days.” “Very good,” said the king, and he bestowed a high ministerial position on Gan Mou, sending the seals of a prime minister of Qin and inviting him to return to Qin. Gan Mou declined to go. Later Su Dai spoke to King Min of Qi, saying, “Gan Mou is a very worthy man. Qin has bestowed a high ministerial post on him, sending the seals of a prime minister and urging him to return to Qin. But Gan Mou is grateful to you for the gifts you have bestowed on him and is happy to be your minister, so he has declined the offer and refuses to go. Now I wonder how you intend to reward him for this.” “Yes, of course,” said the king, and he assigned Gan Mou to a high post and kept him on in Qi. Qin thereupon restored Gan Mou’s family and household belongings to him in order to buy favour with Qi.

齐使甘茂于楚，楚怀王新与秦合婚而驩。而秦闻甘茂在楚，使人谓楚王曰：“愿送甘茂于秦。”楚王问于范蜗曰:“寡人欲置相于秦,孰可?”对曰：“臣不足以识之。”楚王曰：“寡人欲相甘茂,可乎?”对曰：“不可。夫史举，下蔡之监门也，大不为事君,小不为家室,以苟贱不廉闻于世,甘茂事之顺焉。故惠王之明，武王之察，张仪之辩，而甘茂事之，取十官而无罪。茂诚贤者也，然不可相于秦。夫秦之有贤相，非楚国之利也。且王前尝用召滑于越,而内行章义之难，越国乱，故楚南塞厉门而郡江东。计王之功所以能如此者，越国乱而楚治也。今王知用诸越而忘用诸秦，臣以王为钜过矣。然则王若欲置相于秦，则莫若向寿者可。夫向寿之于秦王，亲也，少与之同衣，长与之同车，以听事。王必相向寿于秦，则楚国之利也。”于是使使请秦相向寿于秦。秦卒相向寿,而甘茂竟不得复入秦，卒于魏。
后来齐王派甘茂出使楚国，这时楚怀王刚刚与秦联婚，两国的关系正好。秦国听说甘茂在楚国，就派人去对楚怀王说：“希望您把甘茂送到秦国来。”楚王问范蜗说：“我准备推荐一个人到秦国去当宰相，你看谁合适?”范蜗说：“我没有能力判别这件事。”楚王说：“我想推荐甘茂去，你看行吗?”范蜗说：“不行!过去史举只是下蔡一个看守城门的人，大者不能为国君效力，小者连个家也养不了，在社会上落了个苟且卑贱、污秽贪婪的名声，可是甘茂对待他恭恭敬敬。像秦惠王那么明辨，像秦武王那么苛察，像张仪那么会说，而甘茂在他们面前，连续为官十几任而能够不招致一点麻烦。这一些都说明甘茂确实是一个能人，但是不能让他做秦国的丞相。因为秦国有了好宰相，对于楚国是不利的。当初您曾派了召滑到越国去执政，结果他在越国引起了章义的叛变，造成了越国的混乱，楚国正是趁着这个时机一方面控制了南部的厉门，一方面出兵江东把那里变成了自己的郡县。您当时之所以能取得这种胜利，不就是因为越国混乱而楚国团结统一吗?现在您只知道把这种办法用到越国而不知道把它用到秦国，我认为这是您的大错误。您要是想给秦国推荐宰相，我看没有比向寿更合适的了。向寿和秦王有亲属关系，小时候两人伙着穿衣服，长大了两人合坐一辆车，秦王和大臣们商量事情，向寿都在一旁跟着听。因此要是向寿在秦国做了宰相，那肯定是对楚有利的。”于是楚王派人去向秦王请求任用向寿为相，秦国同意了，而甘茂竟因此没有再能回到秦国，最后死在了魏国。
Qi then dispatched Gan Mou on a mission to Chu. King Huai of Chu had recently taken a bride from the ruling family of Qin and was on intimate terms with Qin. When Qin heard that Gan Mou was in Chu, it sent an envoy to ask the king of Chu to have Gan Mou escorted to Qin. The king of Chu questioned Fan Yuan, saying, “I would like to install someone as prime minister of Qin. Who would be suitable?”131 “That sort thing is beyond my competence,” Fan Yuan replied. “I would like to make Gan Mou prime minister,” said the king of Chu. “Would that do?” “I’m afraid it wouldn’t,” replied Fan Yuan. “His teacher, Shi Ju, was a gatekeeper of Xiacai. On a higher plane Shi Ju did not serve his ruler, on a lower one he took no care of his family, but simply won a reputation as a mean, lowly person who was extraordinarily finicky. But Gan Mou studied under him and somehow managed to get along. Therefore, despite King Hui’s perceptiveness, King Wu’s powers of scrutiny, and Zhang Yi’s discrimination, Gan Mou was able to serve them all, holding ten offices and never once incurring fault. He is indeed a worthy man. But it will not do to have him acting as prime minister of Qin. For if Qin has a worthy prime minister, it will not be to Chu’s benefit. “In the past Your Majesty installed Shao Hua as prime minister in Yue and internal revolt broke out under Zhang Yi. As a result of the confusion in Yue, Chu had to close the Li Gate on its southern border and make the region of Jiangdong into a province. Thanks to Your Majesty’s wise planning, measures such as these could be taken and so, though there was confusion in Yue, Chu remained in good order. “But now, although Your Majesty knew the proper measures to take in Yue you are forgetting the measures appropriate to Qi. It seems to me that you are making a great mistake. If you wish to install a prime minister in Qin, then surely no one would be more suitable than Xiang Shou. Xiang Shou is a relative of the king of Qin. As children they shared the same clothes; as adults they ride in the same carriage so the king may consult him on affairs of state. If Your Majesty sees to it that Xiang Shou becomes prime minister of Qin, that will certainly be to Chu’s advantage.” Chu then sent an envoy to Qin asking that it appoint Xiang Shou as its prime minister. Qin in the end did so. Gan Mou was never permitted to re-enter Qin, but died in Wei.

甘茂有孙曰甘罗。甘罗者，甘茂孙也。茂既死后，甘罗年十二，事秦相文信侯吕不韦。秦始皇帝使刚成君蔡泽于燕,三年而燕王喜使太子丹入质于秦。秦使张唐往相燕,欲与燕共伐赵以广河间之地。张唐谓文信侯曰：“臣尝为秦昭王伐赵,赵怨臣，曰：‘得唐者与百里之地。’今之燕必经赵,臣不可以行。”文信侯不快，未有以强也。甘罗曰：“君侯何不快之甚也?”文信侯曰：“吾令刚成君蔡泽事燕三年，燕太子丹已入质矣，吾自请张卿相燕而不肯行。”甘罗曰：“臣请行之”。”文信侯叱曰：“去!我身自请之而不肯，女焉能行之?”甘罗曰：“大项橐生七岁为孔子师。今臣生十二岁于兹矣，君其试臣，何遽叱乎?”于是甘罗见张卿曰：“卿之功孰与武安君?”卿曰：“武安君南挫强楚，北威燕、赵，战胜攻取，破城堕邑，不知其数，臣之功不如也。”甘罗曰：“应侯之用于秦也，孰与文信侯专?”张卿曰：“应侯不如文信侯专。”甘罗曰：“卿明知其不如文信侯专与?”曰：“知之。”甘罗曰：“应侯欲攻赵,武安君难之”,去咸阳七里而立死于杜邮。今文信侯自请卿相燕而不肯行，臣不知卿所死处矣。”张唐曰：“请因孺子行。”令装治行。
甘茂有个孙子名叫甘罗。甘罗是甘茂的孙子，甘茂死的时候，甘罗才十二岁，在秦国丞相文信侯吕不韦门下做事。三年前，秦始皇派了刚成君蔡泽去燕国当宰相，三年后，燕王喜终于把燕太子丹派到秦国来做人质了。这时秦国又打算派张唐到燕国去做宰相，以便和燕国共同伐赵以扩大秦国在河间一带的地盘。张唐对吕不韦说：“我在昭王时期曾率兵打过赵国，所以赵国特别恨我，他们说：‘谁要是能抓到张唐，就赏给谁方圆百里的领地。'从秦国去燕国必须经过赵国，所以我不能去。”吕不韦一听心里不高兴，但又不好勉强他。这时甘罗见了，他问吕不韦：“您为什么这样不高兴呢?”吕不韦说：“我们让蔡泽到燕国去做宰相到今天已经三年了，燕太子丹也已经来到了我们这里当人质，现在我想换张唐到燕国去做宰相，他不肯去。”甘罗说：“让我来打发他去。”吕不韦认为他是瞎吹，就喝了一声：“去!我自己请他都不行，你怎么能让他去呢?”甘罗说：“过去项橐七岁时就能做孔子的老师，我现在都已经十二岁了，您可以让我去试试，干嘛一听就呵斥我呢?”于是甘罗就去找到了张唐，说：“您的功劳和武安君白起比谁大?”张唐说：“武安君曾经向南打败了强楚，向北威震燕赵，他战必胜，攻必取，一生不知屠灭了多少城邑，我的功劳当然不如他。”甘罗又问：“过去的应侯范雎，和今天的文信侯吕不韦比，谁更在秦国专权?”张唐说：“应侯赶不上文信侯!”甘罗说：“您真的知道应侯不比文信侯更有权力了吗?”张唐说：“知道。”甘罗说：“应侯想要攻打赵国，武安君刚一表示不愿去，结果刚离开咸阳七里路就在杜邮被赐死了。今天文信侯亲自请您去做燕国的宰相而您居然不愿去，我不知道您明天将死在什么地方。”张唐一听吓得立刻说：“冲着你这话，我一定去。”于是叫人赶紧收拾行装准备出发。
Gan Mou had a grandson named Gan Luo. After Gan Mou died, when the boy was still only twelve years old, he entered the service of Lü Buwei, the marquis of Wenxin, who was the prime minister of Qin at the time. The First Emperor of Qin had sent Cai Ze, the lord of Gangcheng, as his envoy to the state of Yan, and three years later King Xi of Yan agreed to send his heir, Prince Dan, as a hostage to the state of Qin. Qin then ordered Zhang Tang to become prime minister of Yan, hoping that Yan would join Qin in an attack on Zhao so that it could broaden the territory under its control in the region between the Yellow River and the Zhang River. Zhang Tang spoke to Lü Buwei, the marquis of Wenxin, about this, saying, “In the past I was ordered by King Zhaoxiang of Qin to carry out an attack on Zhao. The Zhao ministers in their wrath announced that ‘Anyone who seizes Zhang Tang gets a 100 li tract of land!’ Now if I go to Yan, I will invariably have to pass through Zhao. I am afraid I cannot undertake such a journey.” The marquis was unhappy at his refusal but had no way of forcing him to go. Gan Luo said, “My lord, why are you so very unhappy?” The marquis replied, “I sent Cai Ze, the lord of Gangcheng, on a mission to Yan three years ago, and as a result Prince Dan, the heir apparent of Yan, has already come to Qin as a hostage. But now I have personally requested Lord Zhang to go to Yan to become prime minister, and he is unwilling to go!” Gan Luo said, “With your permission, I’ll see that he goes!” “Off with you!” said Lü Buwei, scolding the boy. “I personally asked him to do so and he refused. How could you make him go?” Gan Luo said, “Xiang Tuo was only seven when he acted as teacher to Confucius. And in my case I’m already twelve! Just let me try — there’s no need to start scolding!” Gan Luo then went to see Zhang Tang and said to him, “How do your lordship’s achievements compare with those of Lord Wuan?”134 Zhang Tang replied, “Lord Wuan has thwarted the power of Chu to the south and overawed Yan and Zhao in the north; the battles won, the raids carried out, the towns and villages captured and overrun are in his case beyond numbering. My achievements could never rival his!” Gan Luo said, “And who exercises greater influence in Qin, the marquis of Ying135 or the marquis of Wenxin?” Zhang Tang replied, “The marquis of Ying cannot match the marquis of Wenxin in influence.” Gan Luo said, “Do you really understand, then, that nothing can match the influence of the marquis of Wenxin?” “I understand.” Gan Luo said, “The marquis of Ying wanted to attack Zhao. Lord Wuan ventured to criticize the plan, but before he had gone more than seven li from the capital city of Xianyang, the order came for him to die at Duyou. Now the marquis of Wenxin has personally requested you to become prime minister of Yan, but you are unwilling to go. I do not know how far your lordship will get before the order comes for your death!” Zhang Tang said, “At your suggestion, young man, I believe I will go,” and he ordered his baggage for the journey.

行有日，甘罗谓文信侯曰：“借臣车五乘,请为张唐先报赵。”文信侯乃入言之于始皇曰：“昔甘茂之孙甘罗，年少耳，然名家之子孙，诸侯皆闻之。今者张唐欲称疾不肯行，甘罗说而行之。今愿先报赵，请许遣之。”始皇召见，使甘罗于赵。赵襄王郊迎甘罗。甘罗说赵王曰：“王闻燕太子丹入质秦欤?”曰：“闻之。”曰：“闻张唐相燕欤?”曰：“闻之。”“燕太子丹入秦者，燕不欺秦也。张唐相燕者，秦不欺燕也。燕、秦不相欺者，伐赵，危矣。燕、秦不相欺无异故,欲攻赵而广河间。王不如赍臣五城以广河间,请归燕太子，与强赵攻弱燕。”赵王立自割五城以广河间。秦归燕太子。赵攻燕，得上谷三十城,令秦有十一。甘罗还报秦，乃封甘罗以为上卿,复以始甘茂田宅赐之。
待至张唐出发的日期一定，甘罗对吕不韦说：“请让我带着五辆车，先去替张唐对赵国说一下。”于是吕不韦就进宫对秦始皇说：“甘茂有个孙子叫甘罗，年纪虽然不大，但却不愧是个名家的子弟，各国诸侯也都知道他。前几天张唐想借口生病不肯到燕国去，结果被甘罗一说他就去了。现在甘罗想先去向赵国说一声，请您答应他。”秦始皇一听立即召见了甘罗，并正式派他出使赵国。赵襄王一听秦国的使者来了，就赶紧亲自到郊外迎接。甘罗对赵王说：“您听说燕太子丹到秦国做人质这件事了吗?”赵王说：“已经听说了。”甘罗说：“您也听说张唐要去燕国做宰相这个消息了吗?”赵王说：“也听到了。”甘罗说：“燕太子丹到秦国做人质，这表明了燕国不欺骗秦国。张唐去燕国做宰相，这又表明秦国不欺骗燕国。燕国和秦国这么互相信任，如果一旦联合起来攻打赵国，那赵国不就危险了吗?燕国和秦国为什么要达到这种‘不互相欺骗’呢?目的就是为了打赵国以扩大河间一带的地盘。您不如主动地答应我给秦国五座城，让秦国在河间的地盘有所扩大，而我回去请秦王把燕太子丹放回去，而后让秦国和赵国联合起来一起去攻打弱小的燕国。”赵王一听立刻割给了秦国五座城，而秦国也随即放回了燕太子。接着赵国攻打燕国，夺得了上谷一带的三十多座城池，给了秦国十一个。甘罗回来向秦王报告了这件事，秦王就封甘罗为上卿，并把原先甘茂的那些土地宅舍也都赐给了甘罗。
On the day of his departure, Gan Luo said to his master, the marquis of Wenxin, “If you will lend me five carriages, I would like permission to go to Zhao and make a report on Zhang Tang’s behalf.” Lü Buwei went to court and spoke to the First Emperor, saying, “The former minister Gan Mou has a grandson named Gan Luo. He is still only a boy, but since he is descended from a famous family, the other feudal rulers have all heard of him. Recently, Zhang Tang pleaded illness and was unwilling to go to Yan, but Gan Luo has persuaded him to make the journey. Now I would like to send the boy ahead to report this to Zhao and ask Zhao to permit him to pass through its territory.” The First Emperor summoned Gan Luo to an audience and then sent him to Zhao. King Xiang of Zhao came out to the suburbs of his capital to greet Gan Luo. Gan Luo said to the king, “Has Your Majesty heard that Prince Dan, the heir apparent of Yan, has gone to Qin as a hostage?” “I have heard that.” “Has Your Majesty heard that Zhang Tang is to be the prime minister of Yan?” “I have heard that.” “Prince Dan of Yan’s going to Qin as a hostage is proof that Yan does not intend to play false with Qin. And Zhang Tang’s becoming prime minister of Yan is proof that Qin does not intend to play false with Yan. And if Yan and Qin do not intend to play false with one another, then Zhao is in danger of attack. “The reason Yan and Qin will not play false with one another is that they hope to attack Zhao and broaden their territories in the area between the Yellow and Zhang rivers. Your Majesty would do best to give me five cities so I can broaden Qin’s territory in the area between the rivers. Then I will ask Qin to send Prince Dan back to Yan, and Qin can join with this powerful state of Zhao in attacking a weak Yan.” The king of Zhao immediately detached five of his cities and turned them over to Qin to broaden its territory in the area between the rivers. Qin then returned Prince Dan to Yan, and Zhao attacked Yan and seized thirty cities in the region of Shanggu, eleven of which it gave to Qin. When Gan Luo returned and reported on his mission, Qin enfeoffed him and made him a high minister. It also presented him with the fields and houses that had earlier belonged to his grandfather, Gan Mou.

太史公曰：樗里子以骨肉重,固其理，而秦人称其智，故颇采焉。甘茂起下蔡闾阎,显名诸侯，重强齐、楚。甘罗年少，然出一奇计，声称后世。虽非笃行之君子,然亦战国之策士也。方秦之强时，天下尤趋谋诈哉。
太史公说：樗里子由于亲属关系受到秦国重用，这是可以理解的，但更重要的是他有一种被人们称赞的智谋，所以我写下了他的一些事情。甘茂是一个下蔡的平民，后来竟在各国诸侯中很有名气，受到了强大的齐国和楚国的重视。甘罗年纪不大，但由于出了一条奇计，结果使自己名扬后世。这些人虽然都说不上有多么高的道德，但他们也都是战国时期的著名策士。当时秦国正在日益强盛，所以天下各国都重视搞阴谋诡计的人。
The Grand Historian remarks: Shuli Zi enjoyed high esteem because of his kinship with the ruler, and it was only natural that he should have done so. But the people of Qin recognized his wisdom and therefore took special note of his actions. Gan Mou rose up from the lanes and byways of Xiacai to gain prominence and fame among the feudal rulers, enjoying favour in the powerful states of Qi and Chu. Gan Luo was only a boy, but he devised one unusual scheme and his name is still mentioned in later ages. Though he was not what could be called a gentleman of sterling conduct, he deserves to be ranked with the strategists of the Warring States period. At that time, with Qin so powerful, the world was only too happy to resort to deceitful plots!
