李斯者,楚上蔡人也。年少时，为郡小吏,见吏舍厕中鼠食不絜,近人犬，数惊恐之。斯入仓，观仓中鼠，食积粟，居大庑之下,不见人犬之忧。于是李斯乃叹曰：“人之贤不肖譬如鼠矣，在所自处耳!"
李斯是楚国上蔡人。年轻时，在上蔡郡里当小吏，看见吏舍厕所中的老鼠，吃的是肮脏的粪便，又接近人和狗，经常受惊吓。后来他到了粮仓，看见粮仓里的老鼠，吃的是好粮食，住的是大屋子，又不受人和狗的惊扰。于是李斯就感慨地说：“一个人有没有出息，就像这老鼠一样，在于能不能给自己找到一个好的地方!”
He knew how to elucidate his schemes and, moving with the times, he propelled Qin forward until it was able to have its way with the whole area within the seas. Li Si was its chief planner. Thus I made “The Biography of Li Si”. Li Si was a native of Shangcai in Chu. In his youth he served as a petty clerk in the province. In the privy of the clerks’ quarters he saw how the rats ate the filth and how, when people or dogs came near, they were frequently alarmed and terrified. And when he entered the storehouse he saw how the rats in the storehouse ate the heaps of grain and lived under a big roof, never having to worry about people or dogs. Li Si sighed and said, “Whether a man turns out to be worthy or good-for-nothing is like the rats — it all depends on the surroundings he chooses for himself!”

乃从荀卿学帝王之术。学已成，度楚王不足事,而六国皆弱，无可为建功者，欲西入秦。辞于荀卿曰：“斯闻得时无怠,今万乘方争时，游者主事。今秦王欲吞天下，称帝而治，此布衣驰骛之时而游说者之秋也。处卑贱之位而计不为者,此禽鹿视肉,人面而能强行者耳。故诟莫大于卑贱，而悲莫甚于穷困。久处卑贱之位，困苦之地，非世而恶利，自托于无为，此非士之情也。故斯将西说秦王矣。”
于是他便去跟随荀况学习五帝三王治理天下的学问。学业完成以后，他看着楚王不值得一起共事，而其他几个东方国家又都很弱小，没有一个可以让他建功立业，于是便决心要到西边的秦国去。他向荀况告辞说：“我听说一个人如果遇到时机，那就一定不要放过，如今正是各国诸侯互相争雄的时候，善于游说的人掌握着各国的权柄。现在秦王想要吞并天下，称帝以统治诸侯，这可正是我们这些平头士人们驰骋才华，大展身手的好时机。一个人生活在卑贱的处境中而不能够趁机进取，那就像是捉住了鹿而只看着它的肉却吃不到口，外表一副人样，却只能苟且活着而已。人生没有比处境卑贱更可耻的，没有比困窘潦倒更令人悲哀的了。一个人长期处于卑贱困苦的境地，还要唱高调反对世俗，厌恶名利，把自己打扮成与世无争的样子，那不是人的真实思想。现在我要西去游说秦王。”
In time he became a student of Xun Qing, learning the methods appropriate to an emperor or a king. When he completed his studies, he estimated that the king of Chu would not be worth serving and that, since all of the Six States were weak, he would have no opportunity to win merit under any of them. He therefore decided to go west and enter the service of Qin. When he took his leave of Xun Qing, he said, “I have heard that one must never be lazy in seizing the moment. Now is a time when the rulers of 10,000 chariots are vying for power, when those in search of employment can take command of affairs. The king of Qin wants to swallow up the world, to call himself emperor and rule it. This is the moment for commoners like myself, the harvest season for those with ideas to expound. To occupy a mean and lowly station and never plan for advancement is to be like a bird or beast who spies something to eat but, because there are people around, forces itself to pass it by. Therefore I say, there is no greater disgrace than being mean and lowly, and no greater sorrow than poverty and want. To continue for long in a mean and lowly station, in a situation of hardship and trial, to condemn the age, speak ill of gain, and deliberately choose a course of inaction — this is contrary to human nature. Therefore I plan to go west and speak to the king of Qin!”

至秦，会庄襄王卒,李斯乃求为秦相文信侯吕不韦舍人;不韦贤之，任以为郎。李斯因以得说，说秦王曰:“胥人者，去其几也；成大功者，在因瑕衅而遂忍之。昔者秦穆公之霸,终不东并六国者,何也?诸侯尚众，周德未衰,故五伯迭兴,更尊周室。自秦孝公以来,周室卑微，诸侯相兼，关东为六国，秦之乘胜役诸侯，盖六世矣。今诸侯服秦，譬若郡县。夫以秦之强，大王之贤，由灶上骚除,足以灭诸侯，成帝业，为天下一统，此万世之一时也。今怠而不急就,诸侯复强，相聚约从，虽有黄帝之贤，不能并也。”秦王乃拜斯为长史,听其计，阴遣谋士赍持金玉以游说诸侯。诸侯名士可下以财者，厚遗结之;不肯者，利剑刺之。离其君臣之计四，秦王乃使其良将随其后。秦王拜斯为客卿。
李斯到了秦国，正好碰上庄襄王去世，于是他便去拜见了秦国丞相文信侯吕不韦，请求给他做门客。吕不韦看着李斯有才，就推荐他在秦王跟前当了郎官。李斯于是有了游说秦王的机会。他对秦王说：“一个人总是等待，那就要失去有利时机；能成大功的人，关键就在于抓住机会狠下决心。当年秦穆公一度称霸，但最终没能吞并东方各国，什么原因呢?就因为当时诸侯国还比较多，周王朝的威望也还未衰落，所以当时的几个霸主先后兴起，都打着尊奉周天子的旗号。自从秦孝公以后，周天子的权势已经衰落，各诸侯国互相兼并，最后函谷关以东只剩下六个国家，而秦国乘势奴役东方，到如今已经六代了。现在东方诸国对秦国的屈服，就像秦国国内的郡县一样。以秦国今天的强大和大王的贤明，要想消灭各国，统一天下，完成帝业，那就像打扫一下锅台上的尘土一样轻而易举，这是万世难得的良机。现在如果一旦放松错过机会，让各国再强大起来，联盟合纵，到那时即便再有黄帝的贤明，也不能再吞史_记掉它们了。”于是，秦王遂拜李斯为长史，听从他的计策，暗中派出许多谋士携带着大批黄金珠宝去游说东方各国。对于东方各国那些有声望的人物，能够用财宝收买的，就不惜重金加以收买；对那些不肯接受财物的，就立即把他们杀掉。利用一切手段挑拨离间东方各国君臣之间的关系，随后秦王便派出良将精兵跟着加以征讨。就这样，李斯很快地被秦王任命为客卿。
When he reached Qin, however, he found that King Zhuangxiang had died. He therefore sought service under the prime minister of Qin, Lü Buwei, the marquis of Wenxin, becoming one of his retainers. Lü Buwei thought highly of him and employed him as a court gentleman. Thus Li Si was able to expound his ideas. He spoke to the king of Qin in these words: “A menial man is one who lets his chances slip away. But an accomplisher of great deeds is one who takes advantage of the cracks and openings and can bear to do what has to be done. “In the past, when Duke Mu of Qin was hegemon, he never advanced east to annex the other six states. Why was this? Because at that time the other feudal rulers were still numerous and the virtue of the Zhou dynasty had not yet waned. Therefore the Five Hegemons arose one after the other, and each in turn paid homage to the Zhou royal house. “But from the time of Duke Xiao of Qin on, the Zhou royal house sank into insignificance and the feudal rulers annexed each other’s land, until east of the Pass there were only six states left. Qin, taking advantage of its victories, was able to command the other feudal lords for a period of six reigns.178 “Now the feudal lords are so submissive to Qin that they are like so many provinces and districts. With the power that Qin possesses and Your Majesty’s worth, it would be as easy to wipe out the feudal lords, found an imperial dynasty, and unite the whole world under one rule as it would to dust off the top of an oven! This is an opportunity that comes once in 10,000 ages. If one is lazy and fails to act quickly, the feudal lords will recover their strength and join in an alliance against Qin, and then, though one might be as worthy as the Yellow Emperor, he could never unite them!” The king of Qin honoured Li Si with the post of aide and heeded his suggestions, secretly sending out strategists with gold and jewels to visit the feudal rulers and speak to them persuasively. Among the noted men in the service of the feudal lords, those who could be bought over by wealth were to be subverted with generous gifts, and those who refused were to be stabbed with sharp knives, so as to frustrate the plans of the rulers and their ministers. The king of Qin then dispatched his skilled generals to follow in the wake of the strategists. The king of Qin had honoured Li Si by making him a “guest minister”.

会韩人郑国来间秦，以作注溉渠,已而觉。秦宗室大臣皆言秦王曰：“诸侯人来事秦者，大抵为其主游间于秦耳，请一切逐客。”李斯议亦在逐中。斯乃上书曰:
正好这期间韩国派了一个名叫郑国的水利工程人员来秦国做奸细，郑国为秦国修造一条工程浩大的水渠，目的是消耗秦国的人力物力。不久，郑国的阴谋被发觉了，于是，秦国的王族大臣对秦王说：“东方各国到秦国来的人员，差不多都是替他们的主子来当奸细的，请大王把他们一律轰走。”李斯这时也列在被驱逐的名单之内。于是李斯上书说：
But just at this time a man of the state of Hann named Zheng Guo had come to Qin to supervise construction of an irrigation canal, and the true purpose of his mission had come to light. The members of the Qin ruling family and the high officials all said to the king of Qin: “Persons who come from the states of the other feudal rulers to take office in Qin are in most cases simply seeking in a covert manner to further the interests of their own rulers. We request that all such ‘guests’ or aliens be expelled.” Li Si was among those who were under consideration for expulsion. He therefore submitted a letter to the king which read:

臣闻吏议逐客，窃以为过矣。昔缪公求士,西取由余于戎,东得百里奚于宛,迎蹇叔于宋,来丕豹、公孙支于晋。此五子者，不产于秦，而缪公用之，并国二十，遂霸西戎。孝公用商鞅之法，移风易俗，民以殷盛，国以富强，百姓乐用，诸侯亲服，获楚、魏之师，举地千里,至今治强。惠王用张仪之计,拔三川之地,西并巴、蜀,北收上郡,南取汉中,包九夷，制鄢、郢，东据成皋之险,割膏腴之壤，遂散六国之从，使之西面事秦，功施到今。昭王得范雎，废穰侯，逐华阳，强公室，杜私门,蚕食诸侯，使秦成帝业。此四君者，皆以客之功。由此观之，客何负于秦哉!向使四君却客而不内，疏士而不用，是使国无富利之实而秦无强大之名也。
我听说大臣们提议要驱逐一切东方来客，我觉得这是极其错误的。当初秦缪公为了招纳人才，从西戎招来了由余，在楚国的宛县招来了百里奚，从宋国招来了蹇叔，从晋国招来了丕豹、公孙支。这五个人都不是秦国土生土长的，秦缪公由于使用了他们，最后兼并了二十来个小国，成为了西方的霸主。秦孝公采用商鞅的新法，移风易俗，国富民强，百姓们乐意为国效力，东方各国也都归服了秦国，接着又打败了楚军、魏军，扩地千里，一直强大到今天。秦惠王采用了张仪的计策，向东夺取了三川一带，向西吞并了巴、蜀两国，在北边攻占了上郡，向南夺取了汉中，又向东南吞并了楚国旧有的许多少数民族，以至威胁着楚国的鄢都和郢都，又东出占据了险要的成皋，获取了临近的大片肥沃土地，解散了东方六国的合纵联盟，使它们一个个地听命于秦国，张仪的功劳一直延续到今天。秦昭王得到范雎后，废掉了穰侯魏冉，赶走了华阳君芈戎，从而加强了秦王自身的权力，杜绝了贵戚的专权，同时进一步地向东吞食，为秦国奠定了统一天下的基础。以上提到的四位国君，都是借用着东方来客的力量为秦国建立功勋。由此看来，东方来客有什么亏待秦国的地方呢?如果当初这四位国君都拒绝东方来客而不接纳，排斥这些贤人而不利用，那么秦国就决不会有今天的强大与富足。
I have heard that the officials are debating whether to expel aliens. In my humble opinion that would be a mistake. In the past, when Duke Mu was looking for men, he selected You Yu from among the Rong people of the west, acquired Baili Xi from Wan in the east, welcomed Jian Shu from Song, and summoned Pi Bao and Gongsun Zhi from Jin. These five men were not native sons of Qin, but Duke Mu, by employing them, was able to annex twenty states and eventually become hegemon over the Western Rong. Duke Xiao, by utilizing the laws of Shang Yang, reformed manners and changed customs, so that the population flourished, the state became rich and powerful, the people delighted in their public duties, and the other feudal lords were friendly and submissive. He captured the armies of Chu and Wei and acquired 1,000 li of territory, and the nation to this day remains strong and well governed. King Hui, employing the strategies of Zhang Yi, snatched the region of the Three Rivers, annexed Ba and Shu in the west, acquired Shang Province in the north, and seized Hanzhong in the south. He assimilated the nine Yi tribes, gained control of Yan and Ying, in the east relied on the Chenggao passes to slice off pieces of fertile territory, and eventually broke up the vertical alliance of the Six States and obliged them to face west and serve Qin, and the fruits of his achievements continue to be enjoyed to the present. King Zhaoxiang obtained the services of Fan Ju, dismissed the marquis of Rang, and expelled Lord Huayang, strengthening the ruling house, closing the door to private privilege, eating away silkwormfashion at the lands of the other feudal lords, and making it possible for Qin to set up an imperial regime. These four rulers all had visitors from other states to aid them in their accomplishments. In view of this fact, how can one say that such visitors are disloyal to Qin? If these four rulers had rejected these visitors and refused to admit them to their presence, if they had scorned such men and failed to employ them, then they would have caused Qin to miss out on the realities of wealth and gain, and Qin would never have become famous for power and greatness.

今陛下致昆山之玉,有随、和之宝,垂明月之珠,服太阿之剑,乘纤离之马,建翠凤之旗,树灵鼍之鼓。此数宝者，秦不生一焉，而陛下说之，何也?必秦国之所生然后可，则是夜光之璧不饰朝廷,犀象之器不为玩好,郑、卫之女不充后宫，而骏良驶缇不实外厩,江南金锡不为用，西蜀丹青不为采。所以饰后宫、充下陈、娱心意、说耳目者，必出于秦然后可，则是宛珠之簪,傅玑之珥，阿缟之衣,锦绣之饰不进于前，而随俗雅化佳冶窈窕赵女不立于侧也。夫击瓮叩缶弹筝搏髀，而歌呼呜呜快耳目者，真秦之声也；郑卫《桑间》、《昭》、《虞》、《武》、《象》者四，异国之乐也。今弃击瓮叩缶而就《郑》、《卫》,退弹筝而取《昭》、《虞》,若是者何也?快意当前，适观而已矣。今取人则不然。不问可否，不论曲直，非秦者去，为客者逐。然则是所重者在乎色乐珠玉,而所轻者在乎人民也。此非所以跨海内制诸侯之术也。
您又总爱赏玩昆山的宝玉，以及随侯珠、和氏璧等等，您又喜欢明月珠、太阿剑，您又喜欢纤离马、翠凤旗、灵鼍鼓等等。这几样宝物，可没有一件是出产在秦国的，而您却偏偏喜欢，这是为什么呢?如果一定要秦国出产的东西您才使用，那么您的朝廷上就不该再装饰着夜光璧，您自己也就不该再赏玩那些象牙、犀角做的工艺品，您的后宫里也就不该再有郑、卫两地的美女，您的马棚里也就不该再有外来的良马，您也就不该再用江南的金锡和西蜀的丹青。如果充满后宫，供您使用、帮您开心解闷的一切东西都必须是秦国土生土长，那么那些宛珠装饰的发簪，那些镶嵌玑珠的耳饰，那些软绸白绢制做的衣服，那些织锦刺绣的物饰也就不应该再送到您的身边；那些时髦娴雅、身容娇美的赵国女子也就不应该再侍立在您的左右了。那敲盆子、击瓮、弹筝、拍大腿才是地地道道的秦国音乐；而像郑、卫之音，桑间之乐，以及《昭》、《虞》、《武》、《象》等等，都是来自异国的。您为什么不欣赏那种敲盆子击瓮，而爱听郑、卫之音；为什么不欣赏弹筝拍大腿，而爱听《昭》、《虞》、《武》、《象》呢?还不就是为了取它实际的好听好看，能让人感到快乐么?现在轮到用人，您就不这样了，您不问好坏，不论是非，凡不是秦国土生土长的外方来客，一律赶走。对比之下，您所看重的原来就是那些供您吃喝玩乐的东西，而您所轻易抛弃的却是大批人才。这不是那种想统一天下、吞并诸侯的人的正确做法。
Now Your Majesty imports jade from the Kun Mountains and possesses the treasures of Sui and He. Dangling moon-bright pearls, you buckle on the sword Taia, are drawn by fine steeds like Xianli, set up phoenix banners blazoned with kingfisher feathers, and employ drums of sacred lizard skin. Not one of these various precious things is a product native to Qin, and yet Your Majesty takes joy in them. Why? If something must be a product of Qin before it can be acceptable, then no night-shining jewels would adorn the court chambers, no vessels of rhinoceros horn or elephant tusk would amuse and delight you, no women of Zheng and Wey would throng the harem, and no fine horses and spirited thoroughbreds would fill your stables. The gold and tin from south of the Yantze could not be utilized, the vermilion and blue of Shu could not be used for pigment. If the things that adorn the women’s quarters and fill the lesser apartments, that please the heart and mind and gladden the ear and eye, must originate in Qin before they can be acceptable, then no hairpins of Wan pearls, no gem-studded earrings, no robes of white silk from Donga, no decorations of brocade or embroidery, could be laid before you, and no lovely and enchanting women of Zhao, such as blend in with our customs and lend elegance to the scene, would stand by your side. To thump a water jar and bang a pot, to twang a zither, slap one’s thigh and sing woo-woo as a means of pleasing the ear and eye — this is the true Qin sound. But the songs of Zheng, Wey, and Sangjian, the Zhao, Yu, Wu, and Xiang — these are the music of other states. Yet now you set aside the jar-thumping and pot-banging and turn to the music of Zheng and Wey, you reject the zither-twanging and call for the Zhao and Yu music. Why is this? Simply because one wants something that delights the mind, that is a pleasure to watch. But when you select men, you do not proceed in this manner. You do not ask if the person is suitable or not, you do not inquire whether he is straightforward or devious. He is not a native of Qin, so away with him! Because he is an alien, expel him! From this it would appear that you take great care when it is a matter of feminine beauty or music, jewels or jade, but little care when it is a matter of people. This is hardly the procedure for one who would straddle the whole area within the seas and lord it over the other feudal rulers.

臣闻地广者粟多，国大者人众；兵强则士勇。是以太山不让土壤，故能成其大；河海不择细流，故能就其深；王者不却众庶，故能明其德。是以地无四方,民无异国，四时充美,鬼神降福，此五帝三王之所以无敌也。今乃弃黔首以资敌国,却宾客以业诸侯,使天下之士退而不敢西向，裹足不入秦，此所谓“藉寇兵而赍盗粮”者也。
人们常说，土地宽广才能长出更多的粮食，国土辽阔才能有更多的人口，整体兵力强大单个士兵才更勇猛。正因为泰山能不拒绝接受任何细小的尘土，所以才形成了它今天的高大；正因为黄河大海从不拒绝任何细小的水流，所以才形成了它们今天的深广；正因为做帝王的能够不排斥任何民众，所以才表现出他的伟大与英明。因此土地不分东西南北，都是我的土地；人民不分本国它国，都是我的子民；再加上一年四季风调雨顺，天地鬼神也都降福保佑，这才是五帝三王所以无敌于天下的原因。可现在您却拒绝来投奔您的人士，而把他们推到敌国去；您不让四方到来的宾客们为您效力，而赶着他们去为其他国家建功立业；您让天下所有的人都望而生畏，不敢向西到您的秦国来，这就是平常人们常说的那种“给敌寇提供兵器，帮着他们来打自己”。
I have heard that when lands are extensive, grain is plentiful; when a country is great, its population is numerous; when weapons are powerful, the fighting men are brave. Mt. Tai does not give away a grain of soil, and therefore it can become large. The rivers and oceans do not refuse the tiniest trickle, and therefore they can become deep. A king does not reject the commonest rabble, and therefore he can manifest his virtue. His realm knows no distinction of east or west, north or south, his people no distinction of native land. All four seasons for him are replete with beauty, and the gods and spirits send down good fortune. This is why the Five Emperors and the kings of the Three Dynasties were without rivals. But now Qin would cast away members of the black-headed people so they become an asset to enemy countries, would reject visitors from abroad and thereby further the interests of the other feudal rulers, making it so that gentlemen of the world turn aside and do not venture to face west, halt their steps and refrain from entering Qin. This is what is called lending arms to bandits and supplying rations to thieves.

夫物不产于秦，可宝者多；士不产于秦，而愿忠者众。今逐客以资敌国，损民以益仇，内自虚而外树怨于诸侯，求国无危，不可得也。
不出产于秦国而又的确值得珍视的东西多得很，不生长在秦国而又的确愿意为秦国效忠的人也多得很。您今天却把他们赶回去帮助敌国，孤立自己而壮大敌人，既弄得自己国内空虚，又在其他各国树立了许多敌人，这样搞下去，要想国家没有危险，那是不可能的。
“There are many objects not produced in Qin that are worthy to be deemed precious, and numerous gentlemen not native to Qin who are anxious to render it loyal service. Now if you expel aliens and thereby aid enemy states, deplete the population and thereby increase your opponents, you will be emptying your own state and implanting resentment among the other feudal rulers. If you hope in this way to free Qin from danger, your hopes will be in vain.

秦王乃除逐客之令，复李斯官,卒用其计谋。官至廷尉。二十余年，竟并天下,尊主为皇帝,以斯为丞相。夷郡县城,销其兵刃,示不复用。使秦无尺土之封,不立子弟为王、功臣为诸侯者，使后无战攻之患。
秦王一看立即收回了逐客的命令，恢复了李斯的官职，采用了他的计谋。后来李斯升到了廷尉。又过了二十多年，秦国终于统一了天下，秦王成了皇帝，李斯也当了丞相。接着他们拆除了东方各郡县的城堡，销毁了旧六国的一切兵器，表示今后永远不再打仗了。秦朝统一后，再也不搞任何分封，再也不立秦王的子弟和功臣为王为侯。认为这样可以不再形成割据，不再出现战争。
The king of Qin thereupon withdrew the order for the expulsion of aliens and restored Li Si to his former position. In the end he followed Li Si’s advice on planning, and Li Si in time advanced to the position of commandant of justice. Some twenty years or more after the above incident the Qin ruler united the empire and was honoured with the title of August Emperor. Appointing Li Si as chancellor, he levelled the walls of the provincial and district cities and melted down the swords and other weapons to show that they would no longer be used. He also saw to it that Qin did not parcel out so much as a foot of territory in fiefs. He did not set up his sons or younger brothers as kings, or his meritorious ministers as feudal lords, intending in this way to insure that the empire would never again be troubled by warfare.

始皇三十四年,置酒咸阳宫，博士仆射周青臣等颂称始皇威德。齐人淳于越进谏曰:“臣闻之，殷周之王千余岁,封子弟功臣自为支辅。今陛下有海内，而子弟为匹夫,卒有田常、六卿之患,臣无辅弼，何以相救哉?事不师古而能长久者，非所闻也。今青臣等又面谀以重陛下过,非忠臣也。”始皇下其议丞相。丞相谬其说，绌其辞,乃上书曰：“古者天下散乱，莫能相一四，是以诸侯并作,语皆道古以害今,饰虚言以乱实，人善其所私学，以非上所建立。今陛下并有天下，别白黑而定一尊;而私学乃相与非法教之制,闻令下，即各以其私学议之，入则心非，出则巷议，非主以为名，异趣以为高,率群下以造谤。如此不禁，则主势降乎上，党与成乎下。禁之便。臣请诸有文学《诗》、《书》百家语者,蠲除去之。令到满三十日弗去，黥为城旦。所不去者，医药卜筮种树之书。若有欲学者，以吏为师。”始皇可其议，收去《诗》、《书》百家之语以愚百姓,使天下无以古非今。明法度，定律令,皆以始皇起。同文书。治离宫别馆,周遍天下。明年，又巡狩，外攘四夷,斯皆有力焉。
秦始皇三十四年，在咸阳宫置酒大会群臣，酒席上博士仆射周青臣等人称颂了始皇帝的威德。这时齐国人淳于越起来进谏说：“我听说，商朝和周朝所以能够维持上千年的统治，关键就在于分封子弟作为中央的帮手。如今您统一天下后，您的子弟却仍都是平头百姓，这样日后如果突然有像齐国的田常、晋国的六卿之类的人物造反，您周围没有几个藩臣，谁来救助您呢?办事不效法古人而能维持长久，这事从没听说过。周青臣等人不仅不给您提意见，现在又来当面奉承您，以加重您的过错，这不是忠臣的行为。”秦始皇把这个意见交给丞相裁断。李斯故意歪曲了淳于越的意见而上书说：“前代由于四海分散，不能统一，所以才造成了诸侯们的割据战乱，当时有许多人颂古非今，谣言惑众，吹捧自己的私学，诽谤国家的建树。如今您统一了天下，明确了是非，确立了一统的基业，而社会上却有一些书生诽谤国家的各种制度，国家一有什么法令下来，他们就根据自己的观点评头品足，在家则心怀不满，出门就聚在一起议论。通过批评皇上来提高他们的名声，专门标新立异，鼓动下层，诋毁国家政府。这种情况如不禁止，那么皇上的威望就要降低，下面的党派就要形成。因此必须严厉禁止。我还请求下令：对《诗》、《书》以及诸子百家的书籍一律销毁。如果下令三十天谁还不销毁，就处以黥刑，发去修长城。不销毁的只有看病、算卦和有关种植的一些书。以后谁要是想学习，让他们拜官吏为师就行了。”秦始皇采纳了他的建议，下令没收销毁了《诗》、《书》和诸子百家的著作，目的是让百姓的头脑越来越简单，不要让一些念书人再颂古非今。从这时开始，他们严明法度，编制律令，统一文字。又在全国的各个地区都修建供皇帝巡幸的离宫别馆。第二年，始皇帝又到各地巡视，同时出兵攻伐四围的少数民族。所有这些事情，李斯都出过力。
In the thirty-fourth year of his reign (213 BC) the First Emperor set out wine in his palace in Xianyang. The academicians and the archery captain Zhou Qingchen eulogized the might and virtue of the First Emperor. But a man of Qi named Chunyu Yue stepped forward and delivered this admonition: “I have heard that the kings of the Yin and Zhou dynasties ruled for 1,000 years or more, for they enfeoffed their sons and younger brothers and their meritorious ministers to aid and support them. Now Your Majesty possesses all within the seas, yet your sons and younger brothers are mere commoners. If a Tian Chang or the six great ministers of Jin should suddenly appear, you would be without support or assistance, and how could you be saved? I have never heard of any undertaking that failed to imitate the example of antiquity and yet was able to endure for long! And Zhou Qingchen and the others, by flattering you to your face, are simply compounding Your Majesty’s error — they are no loyal subjects!” The First Emperor referred the matter to the chancellor for discussion. The chancellor considered that the proposal was mistaken and disapproved of such assertions. He submitted a letter to the emperor that read: In the past the empire was fragmented and in confusion and no one was able to unite it. Therefore the feudal rulers rose up side by side, all of them declaiming on antiquity in order to disparage the present, parading empty words in order to confuse the facts. Men prided themselves on their private theories and criticized the measures adopted by their superiors. Now Your Majesty has unified all under heaven, distinguishing black from white and establishing a single source of authority. Yet these adherents of private theories band together to criticize the laws and directives. Hearing that an order has been handed down, each one proceeds to discuss it in the light of his private theories. At court they disapprove in their hearts; outside they debate it in the street. They hold it a mark of fame to criticize the ruler, regard it as lofty to take a dissenting stance, and they lead the lesser officials in fabricating slander. If behaviour such as this is permitted, then in upper circles the authority of the ruler will be compromised, and in lower ones cliques will form. Therefore it should be prohibited. I request that all writings, the Odes, the Documents, and the sayings of the hundred schools of philosophy, be discarded and done away with. Anyone who has failed to discard such books within thirty days from the time this prohibition reaches them shall be subjected to tattooing and condemned to “wall dawn” labour. The books that are to be exempted are those on medicine, divination, agriculture, and forestry. Anyone wishing to study these should have a law official for his teacher. The First Emperor approved this proposal and accordingly confiscated and did away with the Odes, Documents, and sayings of the hundred schools in order to make the common people ignorant and see to it that no one in the empire used the past to criticize the present. The clarification of laws and regulations and fixing of statutes all began with the First Emperor. He unified the system of writing, built detached palaces and pleasure halls, and made a tour throughout the empire. The following year he once more went on a tour, expelling the barbarians on all four sides. Li Si played an important role in all these activities.

斯长男由为三川守,诸男皆尚秦公主,女悉嫁秦诸公子。三川守李由告归咸阳,李斯置酒于家，百官长皆前为寿，门廷车骑以千数。李斯喟然而叹曰:“嗟乎!吾闻之荀卿曰‘物禁大盛’。夫斯乃上蔡布衣，闾巷之黔首，上不知其驽下,遂擢至此。当今人臣之位无居臣上者，可谓富贵极矣。物极则衰，吾未知所税驾也!”
李斯的长子李由是三川郡的郡守，李斯的儿子们娶的都是秦始皇的公主，李斯的女儿们都嫁给了秦始皇的儿子。有一次，李由回咸阳探亲，李斯在家中备酒请客，朝廷里的大员们都来祝贺，门前的车马数以千计。李斯感慨地说：“唉!我曾听荀卿说过：‘什么事都不能太过分。’我本是楚国上蔡的一个平民，生长在一个普通人家，皇上不嫌我无能，把我提拔到了这样一个位置。如今的文武百官，没有一个比我更高的，我的富贵可以说是到了极点。物极必反，我真担心我的下场会是如何啊!"
Li Si’s eldest son You was governor of the province of Sanchuan. All Li Si’s sons were married to daughters of the Qin ruling family, and his daughters were all married to princes of the ruling family. When Li You, the governor of Sanchuan, returned to Xianyang to make his report on government affairs, Li Si set out wine in his home and all the senior officials came to offer their congratulations, the carriages and outriders that crowded his gate and courtyard numbering in the thousands. Li Si sighed and said, “Ah, I have heard Xun Qing say that one must beware of too much prosperity! I started out as a commoner in Shangcai, one of the black-headed people of the lanes and alleys. But the emperor, not realizing how worthless and inept I am, has raised me up to all this. Among all his subjects, none stands higher then I do; mine may be called the pinnacle of wealth and honour. But when a thing reaches its pinnacle, it must decline. I cannot tell where my journey will end!”

始皇三十七年十月,行出游会稽,并海上,北抵琅邪。丞相斯、中车府令赵高兼行符玺令事,皆从。始皇有二十余子，长子扶苏以数直谏上，上使监兵上郡,蒙恬为将。少子胡亥爱,请从，上许之。余子莫从。
秦始皇三十七年十月，始皇帝出巡到会稽，然后沿着海边北上，抵达琅邪。这时丞相李斯，中车府令兼符玺令赵高都跟随在左右。始皇帝有二十多个儿子，长子扶苏因为多次给始皇帝提过意见，被始皇帝派到驻扎在上郡的蒙恬的军队中去做监军。始皇帝的小儿子胡亥一向受到始皇帝的宠爱，请求跟着始皇帝一起出巡，始皇帝答应了。其他的儿子们都没能跟从。
In the thirty-seventh year (210 BC), the tenth month, the First Emperor set out on a trip, journeying to Kuaiji, then following along the seacoast till he reached Langya. The chancellor Li Si and the chief of the office of palace carriage Zhao Gao both accompanied him, bearing the imperial seals and tending to government affairs. The First Emperor had over twenty sons. The eldest, Fusu, had several times remonstrated with the emperor in an outspoken manner, and the emperor had sent him to oversee military affairs in Shang Province, where Meng Tian was in command. His youngest son Huhai, whom he was very fond of, had asked to join the expedition, and the emperor had allowed him to do so, but none of the other sons were in attendance.

其年七月，始皇帝至沙丘,病甚，令赵高为书赐公子扶苏曰：“以兵属蒙恬，与丧会咸阳而葬。”书已封，未授使者，始皇崩。书及玺皆在赵高所，独子胡亥、丞相李斯、赵高及幸宦者五六人知始皇崩，余群臣皆莫知也。李斯以为上在外崩，无真太子,故秘之。置始皇居辊辕车中,百官奏事上食如故，宦者辄从辊辕车中可诸奏事。
当年七月，始皇帝来到沙丘时病倒了，病得很厉害。他让赵高写信给公子扶苏，让他把军队交给蒙恬，赶紧回咸阳，准备迎接始皇的灵柩，而后安葬。书信封好了，还没交给使者送走，始皇帝就去世了。书信和皇帝的印玺都在赵高手里。当时只有公子胡亥、李斯、赵高和五六个亲信的宦官知道始皇帝去世，其余百官都还不知道。李斯觉得皇帝死在外边，身边又没有正式确立的太子，为了免得出乱子，所以就把消息封锁起来。他们把始皇帝的尸体安放在一辆既保暖又通风的车子里，百官凡有事情需请示，以及厨子上供饮食，都照常进行，他派了一个宦官坐在里面答应外边的问话。
In the seventh month, when the First Emperor reached Sand Hill, he fell gravely ill. He ordered Zhao Gao to send a letter to Prince Fusu saying, “Hand over your troops to Meng Tian and come to Xianyang to join the funeral cortege and carry out the burial.” The letter had already been sealed but had not yet been handed over to the courier when the First Emperor passed away. The letter and the imperial seals were all in the possession of Zhao Gao. Only Prince Huhai, the chancellor Li Si, Zhao Gao, and five or six of the trusted eunuchs knew that the First Emperor had passed away. None of the other officials were aware of the fact. In view of the fact that the emperor had died away from the capital and that no heir had been designated, Li Si decided to keep the matter secret, placing the emperor’s body in a carriage that could be opened for cooling or closed for warmth. The officials in attendance continued to deliver state papers and food to the carriage as before, and the eunuchs immediately marked the papers with the emperor’s approval and handed them down from the closed carriage.

赵高因留所赐扶苏玺书,而谓公子胡亥曰：“上崩，无诏封王诸子而独赐长子书。长子至，即立为皇帝，而子无尺寸之地，为之奈何?”胡亥曰：“固也。吾闻之，明君知臣，明父知子。父捐命，不封诸子，何可言者!”赵高曰：“不然。方今天下之权，存亡在子与高及丞相耳，愿子图之。且夫臣人与见臣于人，制人与见制于人，岂可同日道哉!”胡亥曰：“废兄而立弟，是不义也；不奉父诏而畏死,是不孝也；能薄而材谢,强因人之功,是不能也。三者逆德,天下不服，身殆倾危,社稷不血食。”高曰：“臣闻汤、武杀其主，天下称义焉，不为不忠。卫君杀其父,而卫国载其德，孔子著之，不为不孝。夫大行不小谨，盛德不辞让,乡曲各有宜而百官不同功。故顾小而忘大，后必有害；狐疑犹豫，后必有悔。断而敢行，鬼神避之,后有成功。愿子遂之!”胡亥喟然叹曰：“今大行未发,丧礼未终，岂宜以此事干丞相哉!”赵高曰：“时乎时乎，间不及谋!赢粮跃马，唯恐后时!”
这时赵高扣留了始皇帝给扶苏的书信，来对公子胡亥说：“皇帝去世了，没有留下任何分封各位公子为王的命令，而单单留下一封信给长子扶苏。如果扶苏一到，他做了皇帝，而您却得不到尺寸之地，那时您怎么办?”胡亥说：“是啊。俗话说：知臣莫如君，知子莫如父。父亲死了，不封儿子，做儿子的能够说什么呢!”赵高说：“不对。如今天下的生杀全在你、我和丞相三个人的手中，希望您认真考虑。统治人与被人统治，控制人与被人控制，这可是绝对不同的两码事啊!”胡亥说：“废掉兄长而立弟弟，是不仁义的；不奉行父王的诏命而贪生怕死，是不孝的；能力不强还非要去抢夺别人的功业，是没有自知之明。这三条都是极坏的表现，天下人不会心服，自己也会遭殃，国家也得灭亡。”赵高说：“当初商汤、周武王杀掉了他们的君主，天下人并不认为是不忠，反而还称之为义举。卫君辄杀了他的父亲，卫国人还称赞他的功德，孔子也把他的事迹写入《春秋》,并不认为是不孝。办大事、讲大体的人不能顾忌小节，不要怕琐碎的指责，一个地方有一个地方的风俗，一个官员有一个官员的做法，不必划一。顾小而失大的人，日后一定要倒霉；犹豫不断的人，将来一定要后悔。敢作敢为的人，连鬼神都要给他让路，这种人才能成大功。希望您就决心干吧!”胡亥叹息一声说：“现在先帝尚未发丧，一切丧事都还没办，怎么能拿这些事情去麻烦丞相呢!”赵高说：“时间可是急迫的!我们快马加鞭，还怕赶不上呢!"
Zhao Gao kept the letter to Prince Fusu and the imperial seals in his possession and said to Prince Huhai, “The emperor has passed away and has left no edict enfeoffing his sons as kings, but only a letter for his eldest son. When the eldest son arrives, he will be set up as August Emperor, and you will be without so much as a foot of territory. What will you do?” Huhai said, “That should be obvious! I have heard that an enlightened ruler knows his subjects, and an enlightened father knows his sons. If our father has left orders that there are to be no enfeoffments, then what can we, the sons, say?” “Not so!” said Zhao Gao. “At this moment the decision of who shall take control of the empire lies with you, me, and the chancellor alone. I beg you to think of this! To make others your subjects or to be a subject of others, to control men or be controlled by them — these two are so far apart one cannot even speak of them in the same day!” Huhai said, “To cast aside an elder brother and set up a younger one goes against righteousness. To fail to honour a father’s edict out of fear of death goes against filial duty. To be poor in ability and lacking in talent and rely solely on the efforts of others goes against possibility. All three are offences against virtue. The empire would never consent, I would be in a position of peril, and the altars of the soil and grain would never accept my sacrifices.” Zhao Gao said, “Kings Tang and Wu killed their sovereigns but the world called them righteous; no one accused them of being disloyal. The lord of Wey killed his father but the state of Wey lauded his virtue and Confucius made a record of the event; no one said he was lacking in filial piety.182 Great actions do not wait on petty scruples, abundant virtue does not trouble with niceties, and the hundred officials do not all work for the same ends. He who looks after the little and forgets the big will surely pay for it later; he who vacillates and entertains doubts later will have regrets. Only dare to be decisive and the gods and spirits will step aside, so that thereafter you may win success. I beg you to see this through!” Huhai sighed and said, “The royal demise has not yet been announced, the burial rites are not completed — how can it be right to consult the chancellor on such a matter?” Zhao Gao said, “The time, the time! No leisure for planning now. Load up the provisions, set the horses to galloping, and just hope we get there in time!”

胡亥既然高之言，高曰：“不与丞相谋，恐事不能成,臣请为子与丞相谋之。”高乃谓丞相斯曰：“上崩，赐长子书，与丧会咸阳而立为嗣。书未行，今上崩，未有知者也。所赐长子书及符玺皆在胡亥所,定太子在君侯与高之口耳。事将何如?”斯曰：“安得亡国之言!此非人臣所当议也!”
于是胡亥便同意了赵高的意见，赵高说：“这件事不跟丞相说是不行的，我替你去跟他商量。”于是赵高对李斯说：“皇上去世前，曾写给长子扶苏一封信，让他到咸阳去迎接灵车，治办丧事，而后立他为接班人。信还没发走，如今皇上死了，还没有人知道。给扶苏的信和皇帝的符玺都在胡亥手里，究竟立谁为太子，全在咱俩一说。你看这事该怎么办?”李斯说：“你怎能说出这种祸国殃民的话!这种事绝对不是我们当臣子的所该议论的!"
When Huhai had agreed to do as Zhao Gao proposed, the latter said, “If we do not consult with the chancellor, I am afraid we cannot carry this off successfully. Let me consult with him on your behalf.” Then he went and spoke to the chancellor Li Si in these words: “The emperor has passed away, leaving a letter for his eldest son instructing him to meet the funeral cortege at Xianyang and designating him as heir. But the letter has not yet been sent. The emperor has passed away, but no one is aware of it yet. The letter addressed to his eldest son, along with the imperial seals, are all in the possession of Huhai. The choice of an heir apparent depends solely upon your say, my lord, and mine. What do you intend to do?” Li Si said, “How can you speak words that might destroy the nation! This is no matter for a ruler’s subjects to be debating!”

高曰：“君侯自料能孰与蒙恬?功高孰与蒙恬?谋远不失孰与蒙恬?无怨于天下孰与蒙恬?长子旧而信之孰与蒙恬?”斯曰：“此五者皆不及蒙恬，而君责之何深也?”高曰：“高固内官之厮役也,幸得以刀笔之文进入秦宫,管事二十余年，未尝见秦免罢丞相功臣有封及二世者也,卒皆以诛亡。皇帝二十余子，皆君之所知。长子刚毅而武勇，信人而奋士,即位必用蒙恬为丞相，君侯终不怀通侯之印归于乡里,明矣。高受诏教习胡亥，使学以法事数年矣，未尝见过失。慈仁笃厚，轻财重士，辩于心而诎于口,尽礼敬士，秦之诸子未有及此者，可以为嗣。君计而定之。”斯曰：“君其反位!斯奉主之诏，听天之命，何虑之可定也?”
赵高说：“你自己想想，你的才能比得过蒙恬吗?你的功劳比得过蒙恬吗?你的谋略比得过蒙恬吗?你的得人心比得过蒙恬吗?你与扶苏的交情和扶苏对你的信任，比得过蒙恬吗?”李斯说：“这五方面我都比不了蒙恬，但是你为什么这么严厉地提出这些呢?”赵高说：“我只是内廷的一个奴仆，由于熟习律令而进入了秦宫，在我管事的这二十多年中，我没有见过被国家罢免的丞相功臣能有一个把爵禄传给儿子的，都是在当辈就被杀掉了。始皇帝有二十多个儿子，这你是知道的。长子刚毅而勇敢，能结纳人并能发挥人的才能，如果他当了皇帝，必然任蒙恬为丞相，到那时你是不可能保全生命，以列侯的身分回老家的，这一条再清楚不过了。我曾经受命教导胡亥读书，帮他学习法律好几年了，我从未见过他有什么过失。胡亥仁慈厚道，轻财物而重人才，内心聪慧而不善于言辞，礼贤下士，始皇帝的其他公子没有一个能比得过他，可以立他来接班，希望你能考虑考虑，确定下来!”李斯说：“你还是回去吧!我只能遵照先帝的命令行事，听从上天的安排，我自己有什么可以考虑可以决定的呢?”
Zhao Gao said, “Consider for yourself, my lord. In ability, can you compare to Meng Tian? In accumulation of merit, can you compare to Meng Tian? In devising long-range plans that never fail, can you compare to Meng Tian? In the freedom from enmity he enjoys in the world, can you compare to Meng Tian? In the length of friendship and the confidence he enjoys with the eldest son, can you compare to Meng Tian? Li Si replied, “On none of these five counts can I compare to Meng Tian. But why do you tax me so severely?” Zhao Gao said, “I have never been anything but a mere lackey of the inner chambers. But I had the good fortune to be recognized for my ability with the writing brush and scraper, and to be promoted to service in the Qin palace, where I have handled affairs for more than twenty years now. In that time, however, I have never seen any former chancellor or meritorious minister of the Qin who was enfeoffed and was able to pass his fief on to his heirs in the next generation. All in the end have been condemned and put to death. “The emperor has over twenty sons, and you are familiar with them all. The eldest son is strong willed and brave, one who trusts others and inspires loyalty in his men. Once he has ascended the throne he will undoubtedly appoint Meng Tian as his chancellor. And it is quite obvious, my lord, that you will no longer be able to retain your seals as a marquis when you retire to your native village. “I was commanded by the emperor to give instruction to Huhai, tutoring him in legal matters for several years, and I have never known him to make a mistake. He is kindhearted and generous, thinks little of wealth but much of his men, is keen in mind and reserved in speech, punctilious in ritual and respectful of others. None of the other sons of the Qin ruling family can match him. He should be appointed heir. I hope you will consider the matter and make the choice.” Li Si said, “Please return to your post. I will honour the command of my sovereign and heed the mandate of Heaven. What ‘choice’ could come about through my consideration?”

高曰：“安可危也，危可安也。安危不定，何以贵圣?”斯曰：“斯，上蔡闾巷布衣也，上幸擢为丞相，封为通侯，子孙皆至尊位重禄者，故将以存亡安危属臣也。岂可负哉!夫忠臣不避死而庶几,孝子不勤劳而见危,人臣各守其职而已矣。君其勿复言，将令斯得罪。”
赵高说：“平安可能变成危险，危险也可能变成平安。一个人如果连自己的安危都把握不住，那还要聪明智慧干什么?”李斯说：“我本是上蔡县的一个普通百姓，多蒙皇上宠爱，被提拔为丞相、封为侯爵，子孙们也都得到了高官厚禄，皇上已经将国家的存亡安危托付给了我。我怎能辜负呢?当忠臣就应该不贪生不怕死，当孝子就应该任劳任怨，我今天作为一个臣子只能坚守职责。请您不要再多说了，否则将牵累我跟着你倒霉。”
Zhao Gao said, “Safety can be endangered, danger can be rendered safe. If one cannot choose between safety and danger, then what are sages for?” Li Si said, “I was a commoner from the lanes and alleys of Shangcai. The emperor favoured me by promoting me to the office of chancellor and enfeoffing me as a marquis, and my sons and grandsons have all risen to positions of honour and enjoy generous stipends. And since the preservation and safety of the nation have been entrusted to me, how could I betray that charge? A loyal subject, whatever his hopes, does not hesitate to face death, but a filial son, no matter how diligent, avoids courting danger. That is because each man has his own duty to perform. I beg you to say no more of this, or you will force me to commit a crime!”

高曰：“盖闻圣人迁徙无常,就变而从时，见末而知本，观指而睹归。物固有之，安得常法哉!方今天下之权命悬于胡亥,高能得志焉。且夫从外制中谓之惑,从下制上谓之贼。故秋霜降者草花落，水摇动者万物作,此必然之效也。君何见之晚?”斯曰：“吾闻晋易太子，三世不安;齐桓兄弟争位，身死为戮;纣杀亲戚，不听谏者,国为丘墟，遂危社稷：三者逆天,宗庙不血食。斯其犹人哉，安足为谋!”
赵高说：“做圣人的不该顽固于某种常规，应该顺应时宜，随机应变，应该善于看苗头，看动向。事物本来就是变化的，哪有什么一定之规呢?如今天下的大权，都掌握在胡亥手中，而我在胡亥面前可以让他按着我的意志行事。况且外面的人要想制服里面，那就叫妄想，下面的人要想制服上面的人那就叫反叛。秋霜一降，花草就要凋零；冰雪一化，万物就能生长，这都是必然规律。你为什么见不到这一点呢?”李斯说：“昔日晋国由于改换太子，三世不得安宁；齐桓公的几个儿子争位，闹得齐桓公活活饿死；商纣王杀害亲属，不听劝告，京城变为废墟，闹得国破家亡。这三伙都是违背了天道，以至于闹得灭绝无后。我还是个人哪，怎能打那种坏主意?”
Zhao Gao said, “They say that the sage keeps shifting, never constant, going along with change and following the times. He sees the tip and understands the root, observes the finger and perceives where it is pointing. It is in the nature of things to change — how can you devise any constant rule? “At this moment the fate of the empire hangs on Huhai, and I can divine where his ambitions lie. To try to control the inside by imposing force from without may be termed delusion, and to try to control superiors from an inferior position deserves the name of villainy. But when autumn frost descends, then the grass and flowers wither, and when spring waters stir and flow, the ten thousand things come to life. This is the natural and inevitable consequence. How can you be so slow to see it!” Li Si said, “I have heard that the state of Jin changed its choice of heir apparent and three generations of turmoil ensued. Duke Huan of Qi contended with his brothers for the throne and death was the outcome. The tyrant Zhou put his kinsmen to death, refusing to heed remonstrance, and his kingdom became a wilderness, its altars of the soil and grain imperilled. All three offended against Heaven, and their ancestral temples refused to accept their sacrifices. I am the kind of person I am — what use in talking to me of plots?”

高曰：“上下合同,可以长久；中外若一,事无表里。君听臣之计，即长有封侯，世世称孤,必有乔、松之寿,孔、墨之智。今释此而不从，祸及子孙，足为寒心。善者因祸为福，君何处焉?”斯乃仰天而叹，垂泪太息曰：“嗟乎!独遭乱世，既以不能死，安托命哉!”于是斯乃听高。高乃报胡亥曰：“臣请奉太子之明命以报丞相，丞相斯敢不奉令!”
赵高说：“只要上下同心，就可以长治久安；只要内外如一，那就什么事情都能办成。你只要听我的话，我就能保证你世世代代地封侯称孤，能像王子乔、赤松子那么长寿，并能像孔子、墨子那样以智慧闻名；如果放弃机会不跟我干，那么灾祸立即就会殃及你和你的儿孙，其后果是叫人心寒的。作为一个聪明人要能够转祸为福，现在就看你打算怎么办了?”李斯听后仰天长叹，流着泪叹气说：“唉!倒霉碰上这么个混乱的当口，我既然不能效忠而死，那还能去依靠谁呢?”于是李斯就对赵高俯首听命了。赵高立刻回报胡亥说：“我把您的意思通知了丞相，丞相敢不唯您之命是听!”
Zhao Gao said, “When superiors and inferiors are in accord, things will endure for long; when inside and outside are as one, there will be no back or front to affairs. If you listen to my counsel, you can keep possession of your fief and title, and for generation after generation your heirs will call themselves marquis. In longevity you will rival the immortal Prince Qiao and Red Pine, in wisdom you will be like Confucius or Mo Zi. But if you permit this occasion to slip away, then the disaster that will extend to your sons and grandsons is enough to make the heart turn cold! The skilful man turns disaster into blessing. How will you proceed?” Li Si looked up at the heavens in sorrow and, shedding tears and heaving a great sigh, said, “Alas, that I alone should face such troubled times! I failed to die when I should have — now what fate can I hope for?” With this Li Si finally agreed to Zhao Gao’s proposal. Zhao Gao then reported this to Huhai, saying, “I request permission to relay your command as heir apparent to the chancellor. He will surely not dare to disobey.”

于是乃相与谋，诈为受始皇诏，诏丞相立子胡亥为太子。更为书赐长子扶苏曰：“朕巡天下，祷祠名山诸神以延寿命。今扶苏与将军蒙恬将师数十万以屯边，十有余年矣，不能进而前，士卒多秏,无尺寸之功，乃反数上书直言诽谤我所为，以不得罢归为太子,日夜怨望。扶苏为人子不孝，其赐剑以自裁!将军恬与扶苏居外，不匡正，宜知其谋。为人臣不忠，其赐死，以兵属裨将王离。”封其书以皇帝玺，遣胡亥客奉书赐扶苏于上郡。
于是他们几个人就商量好，诈称丞相李斯接受了始皇帝的诏书，诏书让丞相立公子胡亥为太子。又另伪造了一封信给长子扶苏说：“我巡行天下，祭祀名山与天地诸神以求延长寿命。我让扶苏和将军蒙恬率兵几十万驻守边关，现已任职十多年了，竟然没有任何进取，白白损失许多士卒，而没有得来一尺一寸的土地，你还多次上书，诽谤我的所作所为，还每天埋怨我不能及早撤你回京当太子。扶苏作为儿子这是不孝，现赐剑令其自杀!将军蒙恬与扶苏一道在外，不能及时纠正他的过失，知道他的阴谋而不报告。蒙恬作为一个大臣，这是不忠，也同时赐死，把军队交给副将王离。”他们装好书信，盖上始皇帝的印玺，派了胡亥的一个门客把它送往上郡。
The three then plotted together, pretending they had received an edict from the First Emperor instructing the chancellor to set up Huhai as heir apparent. They wrote a new letter to be sent to the eldest son, Prince Fusu, saying: “I, the sovereign, have been touring the empire and performing sacrifices to the deities of the famous mountains in order to prolong my life. Fusu and General Meng Tian, commanding an army of several hundred thousand, have garrisoned the border for over ten years now. They have been wholly unable to advance, but have thrown away the lives of numerous of their men without winning so much as a foot of territory. Not only that, but Fusu has several times sent letters openly criticizing and slandering my conduct, night and day resentful and impatient because he cannot leave his post and return to the capital to become heir apparent. Fusu has not acted as a filial son. I present him with a sword so he may settle the matter for himself. General Meng Tian, while residing on the border with Fusu, has done nothing to correct his faults, though he must be aware of Fusu’s plots. As a subject he has acted disloyally. I present him with the opportunity to take his own life, directing him to hand over his troops to the assistant general Wang Li.” They sealed the letter with the seal of the emperor and dispatched one of Huhai’s followers to deliver it to Fusu in Shang Province.

使者至，发书，扶苏泣，入内舍，欲自杀。蒙恬止扶苏曰：“陛下居外，未立太子，使臣将三十万众守边，公子为监，此天下重任也。今一使者来，即自杀，安知其非诈?请复请，复请而后死,未暮也。”使者数趣之。扶苏为人仁，谓蒙恬曰：“父而赐子死,尚安复请!”即自杀。蒙恬不肯死，使者即以属吏,系于阳周。
使者到了上郡，扶苏打开诏书一看，立刻泪如泉涌，他走进内屋，就要自杀。蒙恬拦阻他说：“陛下巡游在外，事先并没有立谁为太子。他派我率兵三十万镇守边疆，让您来此监军，这都是国家的重任。现在突然派一个使者前来传话，您就忙着自杀，谁能断定其中没有诡诈?请您再请示一下，问明白了再死也不算晚。”但这时使者却再三催促扶苏自杀。扶苏为人忠厚，对蒙恬说：“父亲赐儿子死，还用得着再请示吗?”说罢就自杀了。蒙恬不肯死，使者便把他交给法吏看管，把他囚禁在阳周县。
When the messenger arrived and presented the letter, Fusu retired weeping to his inner quarters, intending to commit suicide. But Meng Tian stopped him, saying, “His Majesty has been residing away from the capital and has not yet designated an heir apparent. He has put me in command of 300,000 men to guard the border and ordered you to act as supervisor. Such assignments are among the most crucial in the whole empire. Now one messenger appears and immediately you prepare to commit suicide. How do you know that this is not some sort of deception? I urge you to ask for confirmation. If the order is confirmed and you then take your life, no one can say you acted tardily.”The messenger several times urged the prince to act. Fusu, being a warmhearted person, said to Meng Tian, “If a father instructs his son to commit suicide, how can he ask for confirmation of the order?” He proceeded to take his life. Meng Tian, however, was unwilling to commit suicide, and so the messenger turned him over to the law officials, who imprisoned him at Yangzhou.

使者还报，胡亥、斯、高大喜。至咸阳，发丧，太子立为二世皇帝。以赵高为郎中令,常侍中用事。
使者回来报告处理的结果，胡亥、李斯、赵高等大喜。他们立即回到咸阳，办理了丧事。立胡亥做了二世皇帝。而赵高被任为郎中令，经常侍奉在皇帝左右，一切事情由他说了算。
The messenger then returned to the capital to report on his mission. Huhai, Li Si, and Zhao Gao were delighted, and when the funeral cortege arrived in Xianyang, the burial was carried out. The heir apparent then ascended the throne, being known as the Second Emperor, with Zhao Gao as chief of palace attendants constantly by his side in the inner palace to tend to affairs of state.

二世燕居,乃召高与谋事，谓曰：“夫人生居世间也，譬犹骋六骥过决隙也。吾既已临天下矣，欲悉耳目之所好,穷心志之所乐，以安宗庙而乐万姓,长有天下，终吾年寿，其道可乎?”高曰：“此贤主之所能行也，而昏乱主之所禁也。臣请言之，不敢避斧钺之诛，愿陛下少留意焉。夫沙丘之谋，诸公子及大臣皆疑焉，而诸公子尽帝兄,大臣又先帝之所置也。今陛下初立，此其属意怏怏皆不服，恐为变。且蒙恬已死，蒙毅将兵居外,臣战战栗栗，唯恐不终。且陛下安得为此乐乎?”二世曰：“为之奈何?”赵高曰：“严法而刻刑，令有罪者相坐诛,至收族，灭大臣而远骨肉;贫者富之，贱者贵之。尽除去先帝之故臣，更置陛下之所亲信者近之。此则阴德归陛下,害除而奸谋塞，群臣莫不被润泽，蒙厚德，陛下则高枕肆志宠乐矣。计莫出于此。”二世然高之言，乃更为法律。于是群臣诸公子有罪，辄下高，令鞠治之。杀大臣蒙毅等，公子十二人缪死咸阳市,十公主研死于杜，财物入于县官，相连坐者不可胜数。
秦二世闲居无事，把赵高叫来，对他说：“人生在世，就像骏马冲过墙缝那么快，现在我已成了天下之主，就想尽量满足耳目的一切欲望，随心所欲地尽情享乐，而且还希望在我所活的这一辈子里能长久地统治天下，我这个要求达得到吗?”赵高说：“作为一个贤明的君主是绝对能够达到的，而一个昏乱的君主是达不到的。现在我豁出死去，给您讲一讲，请您注意听。我们在沙丘的活动，从当时就被您的一些弟兄和大臣们所怀疑，那些公子们都是您的兄长，那些大臣们又都是先帝所任用的。如今您刚刚即位，这些人都闷闷不乐，心里不服，我担心会发生变故。现在蒙恬虽然死了，而蒙毅还带兵在外，为此我整天战战兢兢，担心说不定哪一天送了命。在这种情况下，您怎么能够尽情享乐呢?”秦二世说：“那该怎么办?”赵高说：“实行严刑峻法。谁犯了罪就互相株连，把他们的亲朋一起处死，甚至全族诛灭。要大批地诛杀那些朝廷里的大臣，疏远您的那些兄弟子侄。要让原来贫穷的今天富起来，让原来低贱的今天高贵起来，要全部铲除先帝的那些老臣，全部换上您自己的亲信，并大力提拔任用他们。这样一来那些被提拔的就会感谢您的恩德而归附您，这样祸根就能根除，奸谋就不能得逞了。到那时群臣们都感谢您的恩德仁惠，您就可以高枕无忧，放心地尽情享乐了。这是最好不过的办法。”秦二世觉得赵高的说法不错，便着手重新制定法律，从此朝廷大臣和秦二世的弟兄们只要一犯罪，就把他们交给赵高审问处置。于是大臣蒙毅等被杀，秦二世的十二个弟兄在咸阳街头被斩首，十个姐妹在杜县被剁成了碎块，这些家族的财物被没收归官，而由此牵连被杀的难以计算。
One day when the Second Emperor was at leisure, he summoned Zhao Gao to consult with him. “A person lives in this world no longer than the time it takes for a team of six thoroughbreds to gallop past a crack in the wall,” he said. “I want to savour all the pleasures of eye and ear, to exhaust the delights of heart and mind, insuring the safety of the ancestral temples and joy to the 10,000 clans, remaining long in possession of the empire and living out my allotted years. Is there some way to attain this?” Zhao Gao replied, “This is something that is possible for a worthy ruler, but prohibited to one who is benighted and unruly. I hope you will allow me to speak on the matter, though I venture to do so with a frankness that merits the death penalty, and I ask Your Majesty to reflect a little on what I say. “The other princes and the chief ministers are all suspicious of the plot that was carried out at Sand Hill. The other princes are all elder brothers of Your Majesty, and the chief ministers were put in office by the former emperor. Now Your Majesty has just come to the throne, and these persons are disgruntled in mind and wholly unsubmissive, perhaps even to the point of rebellion. Meng Tian is already dead, but Meng Yi is in command of troops in the outlying area. I am filled with alarm and trepidation, only fearing that your life may be cut short. How could Your Majesty possibly enjoy the kind of pleasures you speak of?” “What should I do then?” asked the Second Emperor. Zhao Gao said, “Make the laws sterner and penalties more severe. See that persons charged with guilt implicate others as well, and that punishments extend to the families of the criminals. Wipe out the chief ministers and sow dissension among kin, enrich those who are poor, elevate those who are humble, rid yourself of the old officials appointed by the former emperor and surround yourself with men who are close to and can be trusted by Your Majesty. Then all gratitude for personal favour will be directed toward Your Majesty, harm will be expelled and devious plots thwarted. There will be none among the officials not enriched by your largesse, the recipient of generous bounty. Your Majesty may then rest easy in mind, indulge your wishes, and enjoy delight to the full. No plan could be better than this!” The Second Emperor, approving of Zhao Gao’s suggestion, proceeded to invent further laws and ordinances. When any of the officials or princes of the ruling family were accused of a crime, they were immediately handed over to Zhao Gao with orders for him to examine and punish them. He put to death Meng Yi and others of the chief ministers, had twelve of the princes executed in the market place of Xianyang, and executed and tore apart the bodies of ten princesses at Du. The wealth and goods of the condemned persons were confiscated by the government. Those who were implicated along with the guilty parties were too numerous even to be counted.

公子高欲奔，恐收族，乃上书曰：“先帝无恙时，臣人则赐食，出则乘舆。御府之衣,臣得赐之；中厩之宝马,臣得赐之。臣当从死而不能,为人子不孝，为人臣不忠。不忠者无名以立于世,臣请从死，愿葬郦山之足。唯上幸哀怜之。”书上，胡亥大说，召赵高而示之，曰：“此可谓急乎?”赵高曰：“人臣当忧死而不暇，何变之得谋!”胡亥可其书，赐钱十万以葬。
公子高被迫想逃跑，因担心珠灭全族，于是向秦二世上书说：“先帝在世时，我入宫则赐给我食物，出朝则赐给我马车，内府里的衣物，宫廷马棚里的宝马，我都曾得以享用。因此，如果我不能为先帝殉葬，我以为这是做儿子的不孝，做臣子的不忠。不忠不孝的人有什么面目活在世上呢?因此我请求跟着先帝死，希望您能把我埋在骊山始皇帝的陵墓脚下。请您可怜我，答应我这点要求。”书信呈上去后，胡亥心花怒放。他把赵高喊来，把公子高的信给他看，说：“这大概就叫走投无路了吧?”赵高说：“当臣子就应该叫他们像这样连死都顾不过来，如果全都像这样，还有什么功夫去图谋造反呢?”胡亥同意了公子高的请求，赐他们家十万钱料理他的丧事。
One of the princes named Gao contemplated fleeing, but he feared that the members of his family would be arrested. He accordingly submitted a memorial to the throne which read: “While the former emperor was still in good health, I was favoured with gifts of food when in the palace and carriages when I went abroad. Robes from the imperial wardrobe and prize horses from the palace stables were graciously bestowed on me. I should by rights have followed the former emperor in death, but I failed to do so. As a son I have acted in an unfilial manner, and as a subject I have been disloyal, and one who acts disloyally wins no fame in the world. I ask leave to follow the former emperor in death, requesting that my body may be buried at the foot of the mausoleum at Mt. Li. I can only hope that the emperor will take pity and grant my request.” When the memorial was submitted, Huhai was delighted. Summoning Zhao Gao, he showed him the memorial and said, “I’ve got them on the run now, haven’t I!” Zhao Gao said, “Your subjects are so worried about death they have no time for anything else! Where would they get the leisure to plot rebellion?” Huhai approved the memorial and presented the man with 100,000 cash to cover the cost of his burial.

法令诛罚日益刻深，群臣人人自危，欲畔者众。又作阿房之宫,治直道、驰道,赋敛愈重，戍徭无已。于是楚戍卒陈胜、吴广等乃作乱,起于山东，杰俊相立，自置为侯王，叛秦，兵至鸿门而却。李斯数欲请间谏，二世不许。而二世责问李斯曰：“吾有私议而有所闻于韩子也,曰‘尧之有天下也，堂高三尺,采椽不斲,茅茨不翦,虽逆旅之宿不勤于此矣。冬日鹿裘，夏日葛衣四，粱粝之食,藜藿之羹,饭土既，啜土钏,虽监门之养不觳于此矣。禹凿龙门,通大夏,疏九河,曲九防，决淳水致之海，而股无胧，胫无毛，手足胼胝，面目黎黑，遂以死于外，葬于会稽,臣虏之劳不烈于此矣’。然则夫所贵于有天下者，岂欲苦形劳神，身处逆旅之宿，口食监门之养，手持臣虏之作哉?此不肖人之所勉也，非贤者之所务也。彼贤人之有天下也，专用天下适己而已矣，此所以贵于有天下也。夫所谓贤人者，必能安天下而治万民，今身且不能利，将恶能治天下哉!故吾愿赐志广欲，长享天下而无害，为之奈何?”李斯子由为三川守，群盗吴广等西略地，过去弗能禁。章邯以破逐广等兵,使者覆案三川相属,诮让斯居三公位，如何令盗如此。李斯恐惧,重爵禄,不知所出，乃阿二世意欲求容，以书对曰：
秦朝的法令诛杀越来越严，大臣们人人自危，想造反的越来越多。再加上秦二世又继续修建阿房宫，大肆修筑直道与驰道，赋税越来越重，徭役没完没了，于是楚地被征发守边戍卒中的陈胜、吴广等带头造反了。从此整个崤山以东的广大地区，头领林立，纷纷而起，自己称侯、称王，最厉害的一股曾一度打到咸阳以东不远的鸿门，后来才兵败退去。这时李斯原也多次想找机会劝劝秦二世，秦二世都不允许。相反地倒责备李斯说：“我曾记得《韩非子》上说过：‘尧当帝王的时候，居室的台基最高不过三尺，作椽子的木料连刮都不刮，屋顶上盖的茅草连剪都不剪，这样的住处连个小客店都不如；尧冬天穿一件鹿皮的皮袄，夏天穿一件麻布的粗衣，吃的是粗饭，喝的是菜汤，盛饭盛汤用的都是粗陶器，这样的生活恐怕连守门的奴才也不可能比这更坏了。大禹曾疏凿龙门，引导黄河流过夏民族居住的地区。他疏通了许多河流，修筑了许多堤坝，把大地上的许多积水都引导入海。由于长年劳作，他的大腿上已经没有细嫩的皮肤，小腿上磨光了汗毛，手脚都结上厚厚的老茧，面孔晒得黝黑，最后累死在外边，埋葬在会稽山下，这样的操劳恐怕连奴仆也不至于比他更过分了。'人们抢着当天子，难道就是为了劳苦身心，住小店，吃奴才饭，干奴才活吗?只有没出息的人才要求干这个，这些不是一个贤能人所希望要的。一个贤能的人当了帝王，他要让天下所有的一切都来满足自己的欲望，这才能表现出一个当天子的尊贵。一个人能称为‘贤明’,就必须能享有天下，统治万民。如果一个人连他自己都不能过得舒服合意，那又怎么能指望他可以治好天下呢?我要的是既能随心所欲，又永远地享有天下，不受任何危害，你看怎么办才行?”李斯的儿子李由是三川郡的郡守，吴广等人向西进军曾经路过三川郡而李由不能阻挡。待至章邯打败了吴广等人以后，秦二世便一批一批地派人去追究三川郡的责任，并责怪李斯，位居国家三公，怎么会让造反的人猖狂到了如此的程度。李斯害怕，怕丢掉爵位俸禄，他实在不知道怎么办了，于是为了保住自己，就来了个一百八十度的大转弯以迎合秦二世的心意，上书说：
Thus the laws and regulations, the punishments and penalties became more numerous and more severe with each day. Each man began to fear for his own safety, and those who longed to revolt were many. In addition there was the construction work on the Epang Palace and the building of fast roads and direct roads; taxes and levies grew increasingly heavy and calls for garrison duty and corvée labour were endless. At this point Chen She and Wu Guang, leaders of a group of garrison soldiers in Chu, began a rebellion, rising up in the area east of the mountains. Heroes and brave men appeared on all sides, setting themselves up as marquises and kings and challenging the Qin rule, their soldiers advancing all the way to Hongmen before being driven back. Li Si several times requested a moment of the emperor’s time so he could remonstrate with him, but the Second Emperor refused to heed him. Instead he berated Li Si, saying, “I have a few opinions of my own! I have heard from Master Han that when Emperor Yao ruled the world, his halls were only three feet off the ground, the speckled beams were not planed, and the thatch of the roofs was left untrimmed. Even someone lodging in a humble inn was not as meanly housed as this. Winter days he wore a deerskin, summer days a robe of kudzu cloth. With coarse millet for food, a soup of greens, he ate his meal from an earthen pot and sipped from an earthen jar. Even the lot of a gatekeeper could not have been as cramped as this. “Emperor Yu chiselled through Dragon Gate and opened up Daxia, clearing courses for the nine rivers, bordering them with nine embankments, and cutting a channel for the stagnant water so that it flowed to the sea. He worked till there was no more down on his thighs or hair on his shins, till his hands and feet were calloused and his face was burned black, and in the end he died far from the capital and was buried at Kuaiji. Even the toil of a slave taken prisoner in the wars could not have been more arduous than this.184 “But if one has the honour of possessing the empire, he surely does not want to weary his body and strain his spirit by lodging like someone in a humble inn, eating the fare of a gatekeeper, and toiling with his hands like a slave taken in the wars! This is a task for a mere dullard to work at, certainly not the undertaking of a man of worth. “When a man of worth possesses the empire, his sole concern is to use the empire to gratify himself. This is why it is considered an honour to hold possession of the empire. A truly worthy ruler should be capable of bringing security to the empire and order to the 10,000 people. But now if I cannot even benefit myself, how can I hope to bring order to the empire at large? That is why I wish to indulge my whims, broaden my desires, enjoy for long the pleasures of the empire, and be free from harm. How shall I go about it?” Li Si’s son Li You was governor of the province of Sanchuan, but when Wu Guang and his band of robbers invaded the western part of the province and passed through, he was unable to stop them. The Qin general Zhang Han eventually defeated Wu Guang’s forces, but envoys were sent to Sanchuan one after the other to investigate the matter. Li Si was strongly reprimanded and asked why, since he occupied one of the three highest posts, he had permitted such outbreaks of bandits. Fearful of what might happen, but reluctant to lose his title and stipend, Li Si did not know how to proceed. So, toadying to the Second Emperor’s wishes and hoping to get into his good graces, he wrote a letter replying to emperor’s question in these words:

夫贤主者，必且能全道而行督责之术者也。督责之，则臣不敢不竭能以徇其主矣。此臣主之分定，上下之义明，则天下贤不肖莫敢不尽力竭任以徇其君矣。是故主独制于天下而无所制也,能穷乐之极矣。贤明之主也，可不察焉!
凡是贤明的君主，必然能够建立一套制度而推行一种督责的办法。一旦推行督责，当臣子的就不敢不竭尽所能来为君主效力了。这样，君臣的名分就能确定，上下的界限就能分明，到那时，不论有能还是无能的人就都不敢不尽心竭力地为您服务了。因此作为帝王要讲究个人独裁，而不受任何别人的限制，这样他就可以享尽一切乐趣了，作为一个贤明的君主，可不能不注意这一点!
The worthy ruler invariably uses all the means at his command to apply the techniques of supervision and reprimand. When supervised and reprimanded, subjects do not dare do otherwise than exhaust their abilities in serving their ruler. In this way the roles of ruler and subject are fixed, the duties of superior and inferior made clear, and thereafter there will be no one in the empire, whether worthy man or dullard, who will fail to exert his utmost strength to carry out his responsibilities in serving his ruler. Hence the ruler alone imposes controls on the empire, and is himself subject to no control whatever. So he can experience the height of enjoyment. Can a worthy and enlightened ruler fail to look into this matter?

故申子曰“有天下而不恣睢，命之曰以天下为桎梏”者,无他焉，不能督责，而顾以其身劳于天下之民，若尧、禹然，故谓之“桎梏”也。夫不能修申、韩之明术,行督责之道，专以天下自适也,而徒务苦形劳神，以身徇百姓，则是黔首之役，非畜天下者也,何足贵哉!夫以人徇己，则己贵而人贱；以己徇人，则己贱而人贵。故徇人者贱，而人所徇者贵，自古及今，未有不然者也。凡古之所为“尊贤”者,为其贵也；而所为恶不肖者，为其贱也。而尧、禹以身徇天下者也，因随而尊之,则亦失所为尊贤之心矣夫!可谓大缪矣。谓之为“桎梏”,不亦宜乎?不能督责之过也。
申不害说过：“一个当帝王的如果不能为所欲为，那就叫把天下当成了镣铐。”这句话没有别的意思，就是指如果当帝王的不能推行督责，相反地倒把自己搞得比一个平民百姓还要累，像尧、禹那个样子，那就是把天下当成了镣铐。一个人不能运用申不害、韩非的办法，不能推行督责，让普天下来满足自己，相反却劳苦身心地去为百姓效力，那就成了当奴隶，而不是当帝王了，这还有什么尊贵的呢?让别人顺着自己，自己就尊贵，别人就低贱；如果让自已去顺着别人，那自己就低贱，别人就尊贵了。让自己顺着别人的自己就要低贱，让别人顺着自己的自己就尊贵，从古到今，都是这个道理。古代为什么有些贤人被人们所尊敬呢，就是因为他高贵。为什么有些人被人瞧不起呢，就是因为他低贱。尧、禹让自己顺从了别人，如果还跟着世俗尊崇他，那就不算尊贤了，那就是大错特错了。我们说他是把天下当成自己的镣铐，这不很合适吗?他们的过错就出在未能推行督责之术。
Therefore Master Shen said, “One who possesses the empire but does not enjoy himself as he pleases may be said to be fettered by the empire.” Indeed, he is just that. If one cannot supervise and reprimand others, but on the contrary wears himself out on behalf of the people of the empire, as emperors Yao and Yu did, he deserves to be called fettered. If he cannot apply the enlightened methods of Master Shen and Master Han, carry out the procedures for supervision and reprimand, and thereby exploit the empire for his own gratification, but merely makes it his duty to weary his body and strain his spirit in order to serve the hundred clans, then he is a lackey of the black-headed people, not the caretaker of the empire. How could such a man be called honoured? If you make others serve you, then you are honoured and others are lowly. But if you must serve others, then you are lowly and others are honoured. Therefore serving others is a lowly act, but to be served by others is to be honoured. From antiquity to the present, there has never been a time when this was not so. All those who in ancient times were esteemed as worthy were held so because they were honoured. And those who were despised as dullards were viewed so because they were lowly. Yao and Yu, as we have seen, undertook to serve the empire. If we esteem them because of it, then we are mistaking the very reason why men are honoured as worthy! This is a grave error. Is it not fitting that they should in fact be called the fettered ones? Their fault was that they failed to supervise and reprimand.

故韩子曰“慈母有败子而严家无格虏”者,何也?罚之加焉必也。故商君之法，刑弃灰于道者。夫弃灰，薄罪也，而被刑，重罚也。彼唯明主为能深督轻罪。夫罪轻且督深，而况有重罪乎?故民不敢犯也。是故韩子曰“布帛寻常，庸人不释，铄金百溢，盗跖不搏”者,非庸人之心深，而盗跖之欲浅也;又不以盗跖之行，为轻百镒之重也。搏必随手刑，则盗跖不搏百镒；而罚不必行也，则庸人不释寻常。是故城高五丈，而楼季不轻犯也；泰山之高百仞，而跛群牧其上。夫楼季也而难五丈之限，岂跛群也而易百仞之高哉?峭堑之势异也。明主圣王之所以能久处尊位，长执重势，而独擅天下之利者，非有异道也，能独断而审督责，必深罚，故天下不敢犯也。今不务所以不犯,而事慈母之所以败子也，则亦不察于圣人之论矣。夫不能行圣人之术，则舍为天下役何事哉?可不哀邪!
韩非曾经说过：“慈母可能养出败家子弟，而家法森严的家庭决出不了不服管教的奴隶。”为什么?就是因为有不可幸免的严厉的惩罚。商鞅曾定过法令，严厉惩治往道上撒灰的人。往道上撤点灰，这是一种小过失，而要处以刑法，看来像是有些重了。但也只有英明的君主才能明白严惩轻罪的意义，一点小过还要重罚，更何况是犯了大罪呢?所以这样一来，人们就不敢轻易犯罪了。韩非说过：“几尺布头，小偷见了也不会放过；而一块烧红的金子，盗跖也不拿。”这并不是说小偷的贪心大，而盗跖的欲望小；也不是因为盗跖有什么操行，不想要那块大金子。只要伸手一抓，手就烫烂，那么即使盗跖也不敢去动金子；而贪点小利不一定会受到刑罚，如果拿了可能没事，那么即使几尺布头，小偷也绝不放过。五丈高的城墙，飞檐走壁的楼季也上不去；几百丈的泰山，瘸腿羊却能到上边吃草。楼季为什么怵头五丈高的城墙，而瘸腿羊却能爬上几百丈高的泰山呢?就因为一个是陡峭的，一个是平缓的。一个圣明的君主所以能长居尊贵之位，长握重大之权，而独享天下之利，这没有别的原因，就在于他能够专制独裁，能坚决推行督责与严刑，让天下人谁也不敢犯法。如果有人不研究如何叫人不敢犯罪，而去干那些慈母惯养败家子的勾当，这种人就是没有理解圣人的言论。如果不能采用圣人的办法，那么除了给人家当奴仆，还能干什么呢?这岂不可悲吗?
So Master Han has said, “A kindly mother may have a no-good son, but in a strict household there are no unruly slaves.”186 This is because the slaves know they are certain to be punished. According to the laws of Lord Shang, anyone discarding ashes in the roadway was subject to penalty. Discarding ashes is a minor offence, and imposing a penalty may seem a heavy punishment. But it is in fact only the enlightened ruler who can supervise and keep careful track of even minor crimes. And if he can supervise and keep careful track of even minor crimes, then how much more so in the case of major crimes. Therefore the people do not dare commit offences. Therefore Master Han said, “If it’s a scrap of common cloth, even an ordinary person will pick it up, but if it’s 100 taels of molten gold, even Robber Zhi won’t touch it. It’s not that the ordinary person is so profoundly greedy for a scrap of common cloth and Robber Zhi so few in his desires, or that the latter despises 100 taels of gold. But because he knows that if he touches it his hand will surely be injured, Robber Zhi will not touch even 100 taels. And because he knows he will not be punished for the act, the ordinary person will not pass up even a scrap of cloth.187 Hence even the nimble Louji could not easily climb a city wall fifty feet high, but lame sheep can graze on top of Mt. Tai, which is 100 times higher. If Louji has difficulty climbing up a mere fifty feet, how can lame sheep manage ten times that height with ease? Because the steepness of the climb differs in the two cases. The reason the enlightened ruler and the sage king can retain his lofty position for so long, continuing to wield might and authority and monopolizing the benefits of the empire, is not that he has some unusual way of proceeding, but because he can decide things for himself, be thorough in his supervising and reprimanding, and certain in the application of harsh penalties. Therefore the empire does not dare disobey him. But if one does not take the steps needed to prevent disobedience, and instead proceeds like the kindly mother who spoils her child, he cannot be said to have understood the secret of how to be a sage. And if he cannot apply the techniques of a sage, he will find himself cast out and made a lackey of the empire, and then what will he do? Can one help but pity him?

且夫俭节仁义之人立于朝，则荒肆之乐辍矣;谏说论理之臣间于侧,则流漫之志诎矣;烈士死节之行显于世,则淫康之虞废矣。故明主能外此三者，而独操主术以制听从之臣,而修其明法，故身尊而势重也。凡贤主者，必将能拂世磨俗,而废其所恶，立其所欲，故生则有尊重之势，死则有贤明之谥也。是以明君独断，故权不在臣也。然后能灭仁义之途,掩驰说之口，困烈士之行，塞聪掩明,内独视听,故外不可倾以仁义烈士之行，而内不可夺以谏说忿争之辩。故能荦然独行恣睢之心而莫之敢逆。若此然后可谓能明申、韩之术，而修商君之法。法修术明而天下乱者，未之闻也，故曰“王道约而易操”也。唯明主为能行之。若此则谓督责之成，督责之成，则臣无邪,臣无邪则天下安，天下安则主严尊，主严尊则督责必，督责必则所求得，所求得则国家富，国家富则君乐丰。故督责之术设，则所欲无不得矣。群臣百姓救过不给，何变之敢图?若此则帝道备,而可谓能明君臣之术矣。虽申、韩复生，不能加也。
如果有一个讲究俭朴、好谈仁义的人站在朝廷上，那么帝王追求毫无限度的享乐的劲头就要受影响；如果有一个好提意见的臣子站在旁边，那么帝王的放荡之心就得有所收敛；如果忠烈死节的行为得到社会的推崇，那么帝王无止境的贪图安乐的想法就会受到克制。因此贤明的君主要坚决排除这三种情况，要独掌君权以驾御所有的臣子，要建立严明的法制，只有如此才能保证自己的身尊势大。凡是贤明的君主，必然和世俗的想法背道而行，必须除掉他所厌恶的，而建立他所喜欢的东西，因此他才能活着有尊贵威严的地位、权势，死后也有一个贤明的称号。所以，明君总是独裁专断，绝不让权力落在大臣手中。只有这样，他才能断绝那种鼓吹仁义的途径，堵住那些游说之士的叫嚣，罢黜那些所谓忠烈的行为表现。不用耳听，不用眼看，单凭自己的意念行事，这样他在外就不会再受那些“仁义”、“忠烈”的炫惑，在内也不为那些劝谏的言词所动摇。这样他才能够独断专行地为所欲为，谁也不敢再违抗他。只有这样，才可以说他是学好了申、韩之术，修明了商君之法了。而法术一旦修明，天下就再也不会大乱，这就是人们常说的“实行王道也并不复杂，很容易掌握”那个话。但这些只有贤明的君王才能做到。像这样才算真正做到了督责，真正做到了督责，那么当臣子的就不可能再为非作歹；大臣们不敢为非作歹，天下就能太平；天下太平了，君主就有威严；君主有了尊严，督责之法就能贯彻实行；督责一严格贯彻，君主的愿望就能满足了；君主的愿望一满足，国家就富了；国家一富，当国君的就可以享乐了。所以说，只要督责一实行，国君就能够想什么有什么。到那时，群臣百姓们都忙着去补救他们自己的罪过，哪还有时间图谋反叛呢?这样统治国家的法术就真正完备了，驾驭群臣的手段，就可以说是明确了。到那时，即使让申不害、韩非再活过来，也不可能超过您的水平。
When frugal and straightlaced men, men of benevolence and righteousness,188 stand at court, then wild and abandoned pleasures cease. When deliverers of sharp reprimand and masters of discourse stand by the ruler’s side, then carefree wishes are cut short. When men of ardour, who would die for their principles, gain recognition in the world, then frivolous delights come to an end. Therefore the enlightened ruler knows how to rid himself of these three types of men. He alone applies the techniques of the ruler, using them to insure docile and obedient subjects and to put into effect his enlightened laws. Therefore he is revered and his authority is weighty. Generally speaking, if one would be a worthy ruler, he must be willing to defy the world and remake its customs, to do away with what he dislikes and encourage what pleases him. Then while he is alive he will be revered and command great authority, and when he is dead he will enjoy a posthumous title expressive of his worth and intelligence. Thus the enlightened sovereign decides things for himself, and therefore power never resides with his ministers. Hence he can obliterate the path of benevolence and righteousness, stop up the mouths of the speechifiers, make it hard for men of ardour to carry out their deeds, close the eyes and ears of others and rely solely on his own sight and hearing. Then when he goes abroad he cannot be swayed by the men of benevolence and righteousness, the men of ardour, and at court he cannot be persuaded by the arguments of the remonstrators, the deliverers of impassioned protest. Therefore he can blithely walk his own way, indulging the desires of his heart, and no one will dare challenge him. When he has done this, then he may be said to understand the techniques of Shen Buhai and Han Fei and to apply the laws of Lord Shang. And when laws are applied and techniques clearly understood, I have never heard of the empire being in disorder. Therefore they say: The way of the king is simple and easy to carry out, but only an enlightened ruler can do so. When such a situation is achieved, it may be called the true application of supervision and reprimand. When supervision and reprimand are truly applied, then subjects will be free of evil. When subjects are free of evil, then the empire will be at peace. When the empire is at peace, then the ruler will be respected. When the ruler is respected, then supervision and reprimand will be applied with certainty. When supervision and reprimand are applied with certainty, then what is sought will be gained. When what is sought may be gained, then the state as a whole will be rich. When the state as a whole is rich, the ruler will enjoy abundant delight. Therefore, if the technique of supervision and reprimand is correctly applied, then one cannot fail to get whatever one wishes. It will be as much as the officials and populace can do just to try to save themselves from error, so how would they dare to plot insurrection? When this is done, then the way of an emperor is made complete, and one may be said to have clearly understood the techniques of ruler and subject. Even if Shen Buhai and Han Fei returned to life again, they could add nothing more!

书奏，二世悦。于是行督责益严，税民深者为明吏。世曰：“若此则可谓能责矣。”刑者相半于道，而死人日成积于市。杀人众者为忠臣。二世曰：“若此则可谓能督矣。”
李斯的奏书呈上之后，秦二世看了很高兴。于是推行督责便越来越严厉。谁剥削压榨老百姓越狠，谁就被认为是好官。秦二世说：“这才叫真正实行了督促。”当时，路上的行人有一半是受过刑的，街头上被处死的人天天尸体成堆，谁杀人杀得多，谁就被认为是忠臣。秦二世说：“这才叫真正实行了纠治。”
When the letter was submitted, the Second Emperor was pleased and proceeded to carry out supervision and reprimand activities with increasing severity. Those who squeezed the largest amount of taxes out of the people were deemed model officials; “Men like this may truly be said to be supervising and reprimanding!” the Second Emperor would say. Half of all the people passing along the roads had suffered punishment, and the bodies of the dead daily piled up in the market place. Those who put the largest numbers of people to death were called loyal ministers; “Men like this may truly be said to be supervising and reprimanding!” the Second Emperor would say.

初，赵高为郎中令，所杀及报私怨众多，恐大臣入朝奏事毁恶之，乃说二世曰：“天子所以贵者，但以闻声，群臣莫得见其面，故号曰‘朕。且陛下富于春秋，未必尽通诸事，今坐朝廷，谴举有不当者,则见短于大臣，非所以示神明于天下也。且陛下深拱禁中,与臣及侍中习法者待事,事来有以揆之。如此，则大臣不敢奏疑事,天下称圣主矣。”二世用其计，乃不坐朝廷见大臣，居禁中。赵高常侍中用事，事皆决于赵高。
赵高当郎中令以来，由于他杀人太多，而且许多是被他报私仇杀掉的，他怕大臣们在秦二世面前揭发他，便对秦二世说：“天子所以尊贵，就在于他只能让人听见他的声音，而见不到他的面孔，所以天子才自称‘朕’。再加上您的岁数不大，未必什么事情都懂，如果坐在朝廷上，处置问题一有不当，就会被大臣们看不起，这就不能向天下显示您的英明伟大了。因此您还是深居宫中，常与我和几个通晓法令的人们在一起，等候着大臣把文件报上来，我们一道商量着处理。这样，大臣就不敢报不真实的情况，这样天下人也就会称颂您的英明伟大了。”秦二世一听很同意，于是就不再上朝面见群臣，整天在宫中不出来，而赵高也经常在宫中办公，国家一切大事都取决于赵高。
Earlier, when Zhao Gao was acting as chief of palace attendants, he put many persons to death or did away with them for reasons of private enmity, and he was afraid that when the chief ministers came to court to report on matters of state, they would speak ill of him. He accordingly advised the Second Emperor, saying, “The reason the Son of Heaven is held in honour is that only his voice is heard and none of the officials are allowed to look on his face. Hence he refers to himself by the special pronoun zhen . Now Your Majesty is young in years and is not yet thoroughly conversant with matters of state. If when you are seated before the court you should make some error in your demotions or promotions to office, you would be exposing your shortcomings before the chief ministers. This is no way to go about displaying godlike enlightenment to the empire “For the time being, Your Majesty might better remain with folded hands in the inner recesses of the palace, where I and the other attendants who are versed in the law may wait on you. Then when some matter comes up, we can assist you in disposing of it. The high officials will not dare to refer questionable matters to the throne, and the world will praise you as a sage monarch.” The Second Emperor followed his advice. He no longer sat in the court and showed himself to the high officials, but remained within the recesses of the palace. Zhao Gao constantly attended him and handled affairs of state, so that all decisions in such matters were made by Zhao Gao.

高闻李斯以为言,乃见丞相曰：“关东群盗多，今上急益发繇治阿房宫,聚狗马无用之物。臣欲谏，为位贱。此真君侯之事，君何不谏?”李斯曰：“固也，吾欲言之久矣。今时上不坐朝廷，上居深宫，吾有所言者，不可传也，欲见无间。”赵高谓曰：“君诚能谏，请为君候上间语君。”于是赵高待二世方燕乐,妇女居前，使人告丞相：“上方间，可奏事。”丞相至宫门上谒,如此者三。二世怒曰：“吾常多闲日，丞相不来。吾方燕私，丞相辄来请事。丞相岂少我哉?且固我哉?”赵高因曰：“如此殆矣!夫沙丘之谋，丞相与焉。今陛下已立为帝，而丞相贵不益,此其意亦望裂地而王矣。且陛下不问臣；臣不敢言。丞相长男李由为三川守，楚盗陈胜等皆丞相傍县之子，以故楚盗公行，过三川,城守不肯击。高闻其文书相往来，未得其审，故未敢以闻。且丞相居外，权重于陛下。”二世以为然。欲案丞相，恐其不审，乃使人案验三川守与盗通状。李斯闻之。
赵高听说李斯想劝劝秦二世，便故意去见李斯说：“函谷关以东已经盗贼四起，而皇上还在急着越来越多地征发劳役修建阿房宫，还在急着搜刮一些狗马等无用的玩物。我早想劝劝皇上，但我的地位太低贱了，这是您的职责范围里的事，您为什么不去劝劝呢?”李斯说：“是啊，我早就想说了，但如今皇上不上朝，天天在宫里，我有些想说的事情，也不能让别人转达，而我自己又没有机会见到皇上。”赵高说：“您要真想劝谏，我可以帮您留心，一旦见到皇上有空，我就立刻告诉您。”于是赵高就专门找了一个秦二世与女人狎乐的工夫，派人去通知李斯说：“皇上现在正有空，您可以前去奏事。”于是李斯立刻就到宫门求见，这样一连好几次。秦二世生气地说：“我平时空闲的时候，丞相不来，偏偏在我私人狎乐的时候，丞相总三番五次地来打扰我，莫非是丞相认为我年轻好欺负，还是以为我见识浅而鄙视我?”赵高乘机对秦二世说：“这可太危险啦!当初我们在沙丘的密谋，丞相是参加了的。如今陛下做了皇帝，而丞相的地位却没有提高，看来他的意思也是想割地为王。有些事您不问我，我也不敢说。丞相的长子李由是三川郡守，楚地的盗贼陈胜等都是丞相老家邻县的人，所以楚地的盗贼可以横行无阻，当他们的队伍在三川郡来来去去的时候，郡守李由只是守城，不肯出击。我听说他和盗贼还有书信来往，由于没有确实的证据，所以没敢告诉您。现在丞相在宫外掌理国政，权势实际比您大。”秦二世听着有道理，想逮捕李斯，又怕问题不确实，于是就派人去调查三川郡守李由与盗贼相通的情况。李斯很快地知道了这个消息。
Zhao Gao, having heard that Li Si had commented on this situation, went to see the chancellor and said, “The robber bands east of the mountains have grown numerous, but at the moment the emperor is busy calling out more labourers to work on the Epang Palace or busying himself with dogs and horses and other useless activities. I would like to reprimand him, but my position is a lowly one. This is really a matter for you, sir. Why don’t you reprimand him?” Li Si replied, “ You are quite right. I have wanted to do so for some time. But nowadays the ruler does not sit in the court. He stays deep within the palace, so I have no way to relay to him what I would like to say, and no chance to see him when I wish to!” “If you really intend to reprimand him,” said Zhao Gao, “then allow me to assist you. I will see when he is at leisure and let you know.” Zhao Gao waited until the Second Emperor was feasting and enjoying himself in the company of his women, and then sent a messenger to inform the chancellor that the emperor was at leisure and could be approached on matters of state. The chancellor proceeded to the palace gate and sent in word requesting an interview. When this had happened three times, the emperor exclaimed angrily, “There are plenty of ordinary times when I am at leisure, but the chancellor never comes. Then, as soon as I am enjoying myself in private, immediately he appears and wants to talk about state affairs. Is it because I’m so young that he treats me this way, or because he thinks I’m stupid?” “This could be dangerous!” said Zhao Gao, seizing the opportunity. “The chancellor was a party to the plot at Sand Hill. But now Your Majesty has become emperor, and the chancellor’s position is no higher than before. Perhaps he’s hoping he can slice off a piece of territory and call himself a king. “Also, I would never have ventured to mention this if Your Majesty had not asked me, but the chancellor’s eldest son Li You is the governor of Sanchuan Province. Chen She and the other bandit leaders in Chu are all men from the districts around the chancellor’s home area. That is why, when the Chu bandits marched brazenly through the province of Sanchuan, the governor stayed within his city walls and was unwilling to attack. I have heard that letters went back and forth between the two parties, though, since I do not as yet have clear proof, I have not ventured to mention this. There is also the fact that the chancellor resides outside the palace and so can wield greater authority than Your Majesty.” The Second Emperor agreed with Zhao Gao and wanted to have the chancellor subjected to investigation, but he was afraid there would be no proof of wrongdoing. He therefore sent an envoy to look into the charges that the governor of Sanchuan had been in communication with the bandits.Li Si learned of this,

是时二世在甘泉,方作觳抵优俳之观。李斯不得见，因上书言赵高之短曰：“臣闻之，臣疑其君,无不危国；妾疑其夫,无不危家。今有大臣擅利擅害，与陛下无异,此甚不便。昔者司城子罕相宋，身行刑罚，以威行之，期年遂劫其君。田常为简公臣,爵列无敌于国，私家之富与公家均,布惠施德,下得百姓，上得群臣，阴取齐国，杀宰予于庭，即弑简公于朝,遂有齐国。此天下所明知也。今高有邪佚之志,危反之行,如子罕相宋也；私家之富，若田氏之于齐也。兼行田常、子罕之逆道而劫陛下之威信,其志若韩配为韩安相也。陛下不图，臣恐其为变也。”二世曰：“何哉?夫高，故宦人也，然不为安肆志，不以危易心，絜行修善，自使至此，以忠得进，以信守位，朕实贤之，而君疑之，何也?且朕少失先人，无所识知，不习治民，而君又老，恐与天下绝矣。朕非属赵君,当谁任哉?且赵君为人精廉强力,下知人情，上能适朕，君其勿疑。”李斯曰：“不然。夫高，故贱人也，无识于理，贪欲无厌，求利不止，列势次主,求欲无穷,臣故曰殆。”二世已前信赵高，恐李斯杀之，乃私告赵高。高曰：“丞相所患者独高，高已死，丞相即欲为田常所为。”于是二世曰：“其以李斯属郎中令!”
当时，秦二世住在甘泉离宫，正在观赏摔跤和滑稽表演。李斯不能面见，便上书向秦二世告发赵高的短处说：“俗话说：臣子的权势如果与君主相当，那就必然要危国；妻妾的权势如果与丈夫相当，那就必然要危家。如今有的大臣专断国事，权力与陛下没有差别，这是很成问题的。当年司城子罕在宋国当丞相，掌管刑罚，威行天下，结果一年就把他的国君控制起来了。田常是齐简公的臣子，爵位在国内无人可比，私家的财产和国家的财产不相上下。他广泛地行惠，在下得到了百姓的爱戴，在上得到群臣的拥护，就这样暗中渐渐地把持了齐国的政权，后来又公开地杀掉了宰予，弑了齐简公，夺取了齐国。这些都是天下人都知晓的事情。如今赵高既有邪恶之心，又有图谋造反的行为，就如当年子罕做宋国丞相时一样；赵高的家产财富，也和当年田常在齐国的形势相当。他兼有田常和子罕两个人的罪恶，而又凭借着您的威望发号施令，他的野心简直和韩记给韩安当丞相时的情景一样。如果您不及早地把他除掉，我怕他是要造反的。”秦二世说：“这是怎么说的呢?赵高只不过是一个宦官，但他能够不因为国家无事就追求安逸，也不因为国家有难而改变心肠，他是靠着积德行善才达到这个地位的。他能靠着忠诚得到提升，又能靠着信义谨守职责，我觉得他实在是个好人，而你却怀疑他，这是为什么?再说，我是年纪轻轻就失去了父亲，没有什么知识，也不懂如何治理百姓，您又老了，实在是怕闹得国家没人管。在这种情况下，我不倚靠赵高依靠谁呢?而且赵高为人精明能干，下知人心，上合我意，你就不要再对他怀疑了。”李斯说：“不是这样。赵高本是个贱人，不明事理，贪得无厌，求取利益永不停手。他的权势已经仅次于您了，可是还贪婪没够，所以我说他是危险的。”由于秦二世向来信任赵高，他怕李斯把他杀掉，于是就暗中将这件事告诉了赵高。赵高说：“现在他所怕的就是我，如果我一死，他马上就会干田常他们所干的那种事情。”于是秦二世下令说：“把李斯交给郎中令查办!”
but at that time the Second Emperor was at the palace at Sweet Springs, amusing himself with wrestling bouts and entertainments put on by actors, and so Li Si was unable to see him. Instead he submitted a memorial describing Zhao Gao’s faults in these words: I have heard that where a subject could be mistaken for the ruler, there is sure to be danger to the state, and where a wife could be mistaken for the husband, there is sure to be danger to the family. Now a certain high minister of Your Majesty arbitrarily dispenses profit and harm in a way no different from Your Majesty. This is a most undesirable situation. In the past, when the supervisor of walls Zihan was prime minister of the state of Song, he personally administered punishments, doing so in a dictatorial manner, and by the end of the year he had succeeded in deposing the ruler. When Tian Chang was in the service of Duke Jian of Qi, he enjoyed a title and rank unrivalled in the state, and the private wealth of his family equalled that of the ducal house. Distributing bounty and conferring favours, he won over the common people under him and his fellow officials in higher circles. Scheming in secret to seize control of Qi, he killed Zai Yu in the courtyard, assassinated Duke Jian at court, and eventually made himself ruler of Qi. These are events known to the whole world. Now Zhao Gao, with his evil and unbridled ambitions and dangerous and treasonable ways, resembles Zihan, the prime minister of Song, while in the private wealth he has accumulated he is like the Tian family of Qi. Following a treacherous path that combines the deeds of Zihan and Tian Chang, he is undermining Your Majesty’s authority, hoping to do as Han Yi did when he was prime minister to King An of Hann. If Your Majesty does not give thought to this, I fear he will turn traitor! The Second Emperor replied, “What is this! Zhao Gao is a eunuch with many years of service. But he does not act willfully when sure of himself, or entertain thoughts of disaffection when he feels threatened. He has been scrupulous in conduct and practised good ways in all his service up to now. He has advanced through loyalty and maintained his position through good faith. I, the sovereign, personally consider him a man of worth. Why do you distrust him? “I was a young man when I lost my father, and I had no knowledge of state affairs and no experience in governing the people. And you were already well along in years. I was afraid that I would become cut off from the empire. If I had not turned to Mr Zhao for help, whom could I have employed? Mr Zhao is a man of integrity and diligence. He understands other people’s feelings, and he knows how to please me. I hope you will not distrust him any longer!” Li Si said, “I cannot agree. Zhao Gao is from a lowly background. He has no understanding of principles, but is insatiable in his greed and never ceases his quest for gain. In rank and authority he is second to the ruler, and his hopes and desires are boundless. Therefore I say he is dangerous!” The Second Emperor had from past time trusted Zhao Gao and was afraid that Li Si would put him to death. He therefore informed Zhao Gao in private of the situation. Zhao Gao said, “I’m the only one the chancellor is worried about. Once I’m dead, the chancellor thinks he can do as Tian Chang did!”

赵高案治李斯。李斯拘执束缚，居囹圄中，仰天而叹曰：“嗟乎，悲夫!不道之君，何可为计哉!昔者桀杀关龙逢,纣杀王子比干,吴王夫差杀伍子胥。此三臣者，岂不忠哉，然而不免于死，所忠者非也。今吾智不及三子，而二世之无道过于桀、纣、夫差，吾以忠死，宜矣。且二世之治岂不乱哉!日者夷其兄弟而自立也，杀忠臣而贵贱人，作为阿房之宫,赋敛天下。吾非不谏也，而不吾听也。凡古圣王，饮食有节，车器有数，宫室有度，出令造事，加费而无益于民利者禁，故能长久治安。今行逆于昆弟，不顾其咎;侵杀忠臣，不思其殃；大为宫室，厚赋天下，不爱其费:三者已行,天下不听。今反者已有天下之半矣，而心尚未寤也，而以赵高为佐，吾必见寇至咸阳，麋鹿游于朝也。”
于是，赵高开始审问李斯。当李斯被逮捕下狱后，他仰天长叹说：“唉，可悲啊!对一个无道的昏君，还能为他考虑什么!当年夏桀杀了贤臣关龙逢，商纣杀了王子比干，吴王夫差杀了伍子胥。这三位大臣，难道不忠吗?但最后却不免一死，这是因为他们选错了效忠的对象。如今我的智谋比不上三位贤臣，而秦二世的残暴无道，却超过了夏桀、商纣和夫差，因此我作为一个忠臣而不得好死，这是必然的。再看秦二世的作为悖乱荒谬到了什么地步!过去他是杀了自己的许多弟兄而自立的，他又专门杀害忠臣而提拔贱人，他为修建阿房宫而大肆地搜刮天下。我并不是没有劝谏过，而是他从来不听。凡是古代的圣帝明王，总是饮食花销有一定的节制，车马器用有一定的数量，宫室不超过一定的规模，不做那些劳民伤财而与世无补的事情，因此国家才能长治久安。现在他谋害兄弟，不怕造孽；杀害忠臣，不怕倒霉；大兴土木，横征暴敛，不惜耗费资财，三件坏事已做，天下人谁也不再听从他的命令。如今起来造反的已有全国的一半，而他还在睡梦里，还依靠赵高作他的帮手，这样下去不用很久我一定会看到盗贼攻入咸阳，野兽在秦朝宫殿的废墟上奔跑的。”
With this the Second Emperor gave instructions that Li Si be handed over to the chief of palace attendants, ordering Zhao Gao to conduct an investigation and take appropriate measures. When Li Si was bound with shackles and taken to prison, he looked up at the heavens and said with a sigh, “This is sad work! How can one lay plans for an unprincipled ruler? In ancient times Jie put to death Guan Longfeng, Zhou put to death Prince Bi Gan, and King Fuchai of Wu put to death Wu Zixu. These three ministers were surely not disloyal, yet they could not escape death. They died because the ones they were loyal to were at fault. Now I cannot equal these three in wisdom, and the Second Emperor is far more unprincipled than Jie, Zhou, and Fuchai. It is only right that I die for my loyalty. “How can the Second Emperor’s reign fail to face disorder? Earlier he destroyed his brothers to make himself ruler, put to death his loyal ministers and elevated lowly persons in their stead, continued construction of the Epang Palace and burdened the empire with taxes and levies. It is not that I did not admonish him, but he would not heed me. “The sage kings of antiquity as a rule observed moderation in food and drink, restricted the number of their carriages and implements and the size of their palaces. In issuing orders and initiating undertakings they prohibited what was costly and brought no benefit to the people. Therefore they were able to continue in power and their reigns were peaceful. “But now we have one who turns viciously on his brothers and never stops to consider his offence, who mistreats and puts to death his loyal ministers with no thought of misfortune, who enlarges his palaces and increases the tax burden without any care for expenditure. Since he has committed these three types of actions, the empire no longer heeds him. Even now over half the empire has turned against him. But he fails to waken to the situation and continues to use Zhao Gao as his helper. I will live to see the insurrectionists enter Xianyang and the wild deer roam in the palace!”

于是二世乃使高案丞相狱，治罪,责斯与子由谋反状，皆收捕宗族宾客。赵高治斯，榜掠千余,不胜痛，自诬服。斯所以不死者，自负其辩，有功,实无反心，幸得上书自陈，幸二世之悟而赦之。李斯乃从狱中上书曰：“臣为丞相治民，三十余年矣。逮秦地之陕隘。先王之时秦地不过千里，兵数十万。臣尽薄材,谨奉法令，阴行谋臣，资之金玉，使游说诸侯,阴修甲兵，饰政教，官斗士，尊功臣，盛其爵禄,故终以胁韩弱魏，破燕、赵，夷齐、楚，卒兼六国，虏其王，立秦为天子。罪一矣。地非不广，又北逐胡貉,南定百越,以见秦之强。罪二矣。尊大臣，盛其爵位，以固其亲。罪三矣。立社稷，修宗庙，以明主之贤。罪四矣。更剋画文章，平斗斛度量，布之天下，以树秦之名。罪五矣。治驰道，兴游观，以见主之得意。罪六矣。缓刑罚，薄赋敛，以遂主得众之心，万民戴主，死而不忘。罪七矣。若斯之为臣者，罪足以死固久矣。上幸尽其能力，乃得至今，愿陛下察之!”书上，赵高使吏弃去不奏，曰：“囚安得上书!”
秦二世让赵高审问李斯，给李斯定罪。赵高逼迫李斯承认与他的儿子李由共同谋反，把李斯的宗族、宾客都下了狱。赵高审问李斯，将李斯拷打了一千多板子，李斯受不住了，只好含冤招认。李斯所以忍辱不自杀，就因为他认为自己有功劳又善辩，又确实没有谋反之心，希望能通过上书自陈，使秦二世醒悟过来而赦免他。于是李斯就在狱中上书说：“我当丞相治理国家已经三十多年了，我曾见过当年秦国疆土的狭小。先王刚即位时，秦国的土地纵横不过千里，士兵只有几十万。是我尽着自己微薄的才能，谨慎地奉行着国家的法令，暗中派遣谋臣，让他们携带金玉，去游说东方诸侯，同时又在国内暗中操练甲兵，整顿政教，奖励勇士，尊重功臣，提高他们的爵位俸禄，因而得以逐渐地胁迫韩国，削弱魏国，攻破了燕、赵，荡平了齐、楚，最后兼并六国，俘虏他们的君主，使先帝做了天子。大概这就是我的第一条大罪。兼并六国后，我们的疆域已经不算不广阔了，可是我又辅佐先帝向北驱赶了匈奴、朝鲜，向南平定了百越，以显示我们秦朝的强盛。这大概就是我的第二条大罪。这以后我又在国内尊重大臣，提高他们的爵位，以巩固他们与朝廷的亲密关系。这大概算我的第三条大罪。我为国家建立了社稷坛，修筑了宗庙，显示了皇帝的贤德。这大概是我的第四条大罪。我改革了文字，统一了度量衡，将其公布于天下，提高了秦朝的声望。这大概是我的第五条大罪。我修建了许多专供皇帝车驾行走的大道，兴建了许多离宫别馆。这大概是我的第六条大罪。我减轻刑罚，放宽赋税，使皇上受到了万民们拥戴，让他们至死不变心。这大概是我的第七条大罪。像我这样的臣子，我犯的罪早就该死了。大概是由于您想让我多发挥一些能力，所以才让我活到今天，希望您多加谅察。”书到了赵高手里，赵高立刻派人把它扔掉了，根本不送给秦二世。他说：“一个囚犯有什么资格上书!"
The Second Emperor ordered Zhao Gao to press ahead with his investigation into the chancellor’s guilt, accusing him of plotting rebellion in league with his son Li You. All their family members and retainers were taken into custody. Zhao Gao subjected Li Si to over 1,000 blows of the bastinado, till he could no longer endure the pain and falsely confessed to the charges. The reason Li Si did not take his own life was that he had confidence in his eloquence and his past merits, and was in fact innocent of treasonous intentions. He thought that if the ruler would only permit him to submit a letter explaining his case, the Second Emperor would understand and bestow pardon on him. He therefore submitted the following letter from prison: As chancellor I have governed the people for over thirty years, beginning in the era when Qin’s lands were narrow and confined. In the time of the former king, Qin’s territory did not measure over 1,000 li and its soldiers numbered several hundred thousand. Exerting my paltry talents and diligently upholding the laws and commands, I sent out strategists in secret, providing them with gold and treasures and dispatching them to speak on our behalf at the courts of the feudal rulers. I also covertly stored up weapons, put the government policies in order, promoted military men to office and honoured meritorious ministers, seeing to it that they enjoyed appropriate titles and stipends. So in the end we were able to intimidate Hann and weaken Wei, defeat Yan and Zhao, conquer Qi and Chu, and eventually annex all the Six States, making prisoners of their kings and elevating the Qin ruler to the position of Son of Heaven. This was my first crime. Though Qin’s land was not without breadth to begin with, I went on to drive out the Hu and Mo barbarians in the north and to gain control of the Hundred Yue tribes of the south, in that way displaying Qin’s might. This was my second crime. I heaped honour on the chief ministers, showering them with titles and position, and in that way insured their loyalty, which was my third crime. I set up altars of the soil and grain and repaired the ancestral temples, thus making clear the worth of the ruler — my fourth crime. I changed the regulations and made the weights and measures and ordinances uniform, promulgating them throughout the empire and thus bringing fame to the Qin dynasty — my fifth crime. I constructed direct and fast roads and built pleasure parks and scenic towers, impressing on all the privileges of the ruler — my sixth crime. I relaxed penalties and lessened taxes and levies, in that way enabling the ruler to win the hearts of the multitude, so that the 10,000 people would uphold him and never forget him even in death — my seventh crime. This is the kind of subject I have been, and my crimes have long been deserving of death. But the ruler has graciously permitted me to go on exhausting my strength and ability down to the present time. I beg Your Majesty to consider this. When the letter was submitted, Zhao Gao ordered his clerks to throw it away and not forward it to the emperor, saying, “How can a prisoner submit a letter to the throne!”

赵高使其客十余辈诈为御史、谒者、侍中,更往覆讯斯。斯更以其实对,辄使人复榜之。后二世使人验斯，斯以为如前，终不敢更言,辞服。奏当上,二世喜曰：“微赵君，几为丞相所卖。”及二世所使案三川之守至,则项梁已击杀之。使者来，会丞相下吏，赵高皆妄为反辞。
赵高随即又派了十来伙自己的门客，让他们假装成秦二世派来的御史、谒者、侍中等官员，陆续不断地来审讯李斯。李斯以为他们真是秦二世派来的人，翻去不实之辞按实情回答，他们就让人狠狠地拷打。后来秦二世真的派人来查问了，李斯误以为又是那伙人，反而倒不敢更说别的，只有屈服认罪了。赵高把对李斯的判决上报秦二世，秦二世感谢地说：“要不是有赵先生，我差点受了丞相的骗。”当秦二世派去调查李由的使者到达三川郡时，李由已被项梁所杀。使者回到京城时，李斯已经下狱，于是赵高就彻头彻尾地编造了一套李由造反的材料。
Zhao Gao had ten or more of his own retainers pretend to be from the imperial secretary or the master of guests and palace attendants and sent them one after another to examine Li Si once more on the charges. When Li Si would reply with truthful answers, however, Zhao Gao would immediately have him subjected to further beating. Later the Second Emperor sent a man to examine him, but Li Si, assuming he was the same as those who had examined him earlier, in the end refused to say anything more. He submitted to the charges, and the case was then referred to the emperor for sentencing. The Second Emperor remarked with delight, “If it hadn’t been for Mr Zhao, I would have been betrayed by the chancellor!” Earlier, the Second Emperor had sent an envoy to investigate Li You, the governor of Sanchuan Province, but by the time the envoy arrived, the governor had already been attacked and killed by the rebel general Xiang Liang. The envoy returned to the capital just when Li Si was handed over to the law officials. Zhao Gao falsified all the reports to make it appear that there had been treasonable activity.

二世二年七月,具斯五刑,论腰斩咸阳市。斯出狱，与其中子俱执,顾谓其中子曰：“吾欲与若复牵黄犬俱出上蔡东门逐狡兔，岂可得乎?”遂父子相哭，而夷三族。
秦二世二年七月，赵高根据刑法给李斯定罪，判处他在咸阳的街市腰斩。当李斯和他的中子一起被捆绑着押解出狱的时候，李斯对他的儿子说：“这时候我要是还想和你牵着黄狗一起出上蔡东门去猎狡兔，还办得到吗?”于是父子二人相对痛哭，最后李斯和他的三族都被赵高杀光了。
In the second year of the Second Emperor’s reign (208 BC), the seventh month, Li Si was sentenced to undergo the five penalties and to be cut in two at the waist in the market place of Xianyang. As Li Si left the prison, he was accompanied by his younger son, who had been imprisoned with him. Turning to his son, he said, “I wish you and I could once more take our yellow dog and go out the eastern gate of Shangcai to chase the wily rabbits. But there’s little hope of that, is there!” Then father and son wept, and Li Si and all his three sets of relatives were executed.

李斯已死，二世拜赵高为中丞相,事无大小辄决于高。高自知权重，乃献鹿，谓之马。二世问左右：“此乃鹿也?”左右皆曰“马也”。二世惊，自以为惑,乃召太卜,令卦之。太卜曰：“陛下春秋郊祀,奉宗庙鬼神，斋戒不明,故至于此。可依盛德而明斋戒。”于是乃入上林斋戒。日游弋猎,有行人入上林中，二世自射杀之。赵高教其女婿咸阳令阎乐劾不知何人贼杀人，移上林。高乃谏二世曰：“天子无故贼杀不辜人，此上帝之禁也，鬼神不享，天且降殃，当远避宫以禳之。”二世乃出居望夷之宫。
李斯死后，秦二世让赵高做了丞相，专门在宫中处理国事，事无大小一律取决于赵高。赵高为了检验一下看看自己的权势究竟有多大，于是就给秦二世送去一只鹿，嘴里却说这是一匹马。秦二世问左右说：“这不是鹿吗?”但左右都顺着赵高的口气说：“这是马。”秦二世很吃惊，以为是自己的精神错乱了，便把掌管占卜的人员找来，让他们给自己占卦。太卜说：“这是由于您祭祀天地、宗庙时没有恭敬地斋戒，所以才导致这种结果。您应该依照古代圣贤的做法，虔诚地斋戒。”于是秦二世就到上林苑斋戒。但他实际上整天是在那里射猎游玩，有个过路的进了上林苑，秦二世亲手把他射死了。这时赵高便打发他的女婿咸阳令阎乐故意向秦二世启奏说：“不知什么人射死了行人，请责令主管上林苑的官员捉拿凶手。”而赵高则去对秦二世说：“作为一个皇帝竟无故杀人，这是老天爷所不容的，鬼神也不会保佑，老天爷会降下灾祸的，您应该远远地离开皇宫，去外头祈祷。”于是秦二世便离开了京城，远远地去了望夷宫。
After Li Si’s death, the Second Emperor promoted Zhao Gao to the position of chancellor within the palace. All affairs of state, whether great or small, were summarily decided by Zhao Gao. To test the weight of his authority, he presented a deer to the emperor but called it a horse. The Second Emperor questioned those around him, saying, “Surely this is a deer!” But those in attendance all replied, “It is a horse.” The Second Emperor, alarmed, supposed he must be suffering from some sort of delusion. He summoned the Grand Diviner and had him conduct a divination. The Grand Diviner replied, “When Your Majesty performs the suburban sacrifice in the spring and autumn and attends the spirits of the ancestral temples, the fasting and purification are not carried out in a clearcut manner. Therefore this has come about. You should rely upon your manifold virtue and be clearcut in your fasting and purification.” The emperor therefore retired to the Shanglin Park to fast and purify himself, though in fact he spent the days amusing himself in gaming and hunting. When a passerby happened into the park, the Second Emperor himself shot and killed the man. Zhao Gao instructed his daughter’s husband, Yan Yue, the magistrate of Xianyang, to bring charges, saying that someone of unknown identity had wantonly killed a man and moved the body to the Shanglin Park.191 Zhao Gao then admonished the Second Emperor, saying, “The Son of Heaven for no reason has wantonly killed an innocent man. Such conduct is forbidden by the Lord on High and unacceptable to the gods and spirits. Heaven will send down misfortune! You must retire far from the palace and carry out sacrifices!”

留三日，赵高诈诏卫士,令士皆素服持兵内乡,入告二世曰:“山东群盗兵大至!”二世上观而见之,恐惧，高即因劫令自杀。引玺而佩之,左右百官莫从；上殿，殿欲坏者三。高自知天弗与，群臣弗许，乃召始皇弟，授之玺。
三天后，赵高假托秦二世的命令，诏卫士进宫，让他们都穿着白衣裳，手持兵器冲入望夷宫内，而他自己则跑去对秦二世说：“东方的大批土匪杀进来了!”秦二世爬到高处观望，也看不清到底是什么人，非常害怕，于是赵高便乘势逼着他自杀了。赵高拿过秦二世的玉玺自己佩戴起来，但左右的百官们都不愿意跟着他干。赵高想登上宝殿坐坐，而宝殿摇摇晃晃像是要倒。赵高自知老天爷不保佑他，大臣们不答应，于是只好另找来了秦始皇的弟弟子婴，把皇帝的玉玺交给了他。
The Second Emperor accordingly left the capital and took up residence in the Wangyi Palace, remaining there for three days. Zhao Gao forged an edict to the imperial guards, ordering them all to don white clothing, hold their weapons in readiness, and face the inner chambers of the palace. He himself entered and announced to the Second Emperor, “The rebel forces from east of the mountains have arrived in great numbers!” The Second Emperor climbed the observation tower and, looking out and seeing the guards, was terrified. Zhao Gao then threatened him until he had forced him to commit suicide. Zhao Gao took the imperial seals and hung them from his own belt, but none of the hundred officials in attendance on the emperor would obey him. He mounted the throne room, but the throne room shook three times as though it would collapse. Zhao Gao realized then that Heaven would not sanction his action and that none of the officials would agree to it, and so he summoned a grandson of the First Emperor and turned over the seals to him.

子婴即位，患之,乃称疾不听事，与宦者韩谈及其子谋杀高。高上谒，请病,因召入，令韩谈刺杀之，夷其三族。
子婴即位后，忧虑赵高的专权，于是便诈称有病，不问国事，而暗中与宦官韩谈及自己的儿子谋划杀赵高的事。赵高前来求见子婴，探望子婴的病情，于是子婴召他入宫，趁势让韩谈把他刺死了，接着又灭了赵高的三族。
After the grandson, Ziying, had become ruler, he was fearful of what might happen and, pleading illness, declined to attend to affairs of state. Instead he plotted with a eunuch named Han Tan and his son to kill Zhao Gao. When Zhao Gao came to visit the ruler and inquire about his illness, Ziying called him in and then had Han Tan stab and kill him. All of Zhao Gao’s three sets of relatives were executed.

子婴立三月,沛公兵从武关入,至咸阳，群臣百官皆畔，不適。子婴与妻子自系其颈以组,降轵道旁。沛公因以属吏，项王至而斩之,遂以亡天下。
子婴上台后的第三个月，刘邦率兵从武关攻入到达咸阳，这时秦朝的百官群臣都叛变了，没有人再抵抗刘邦的军队。于是子婴便带着他的妻儿，自己用白绫锁着脖子，站在轵道旁边迎着刘邦向刘邦投降了。刘邦把他们交给专人看管起来，待至项羽入关后，便杀掉了子婴，秦朝遂宣告灭亡。
Three months after Ziying became ruler, the forces of the governor of Pei entered the Wu Pass and made their way to Xianyang. All of the hundred officials deserted the Qin and none offered any resistance. Ziying came with his wife and children, tying a rope around his neck and surrendering by the side of Zhi Road. The governor of Pei handed him over to the officials. When Xiang Yu arrived, he had Ziying executed, and so Qin in the end lost the empire.

太史公曰：李斯以闾阎历诸侯,入事秦，因瑕衅，以辅始皇,卒成帝业。斯为三公，可谓尊用矣。斯知六艺之归,不务明政以补主上之缺，持爵禄之重，阿顺苟合，严威酷刑,听高邪说，废适立庶。诸侯已畔，斯乃欲谏争，不亦末乎!人皆以斯极忠而被五刑死,察其本，乃与俗议之异。不然，斯之功且与周、召列矣。
太史公说：李斯从一个平头士子游说诸侯，后来到秦国效力，由于能够抓住时机，遂帮助秦始皇统一了天下，自己也成了国家的三公，可以说是很受到尊宠重用了。李斯是懂得儒家《六经》的宗旨的，但他不想修明政治，纠正君主的缺点，相反地为了保住高官厚禄，而只顾阿谀奉承，实行严刑酷法，又听从赵高的邪说，废掉扶苏而立胡亥。天下已经造反了，李斯才想劝谏秦二世，这岂不太晚了吗?人们都认为李斯是忠心耿耿，死得冤枉，其实如果认真考察一下事实真相，才知道情况并不像众人所说的那样。要不然，李斯就真可以同周朝的周公、召公相比美了。
The Grand Historian remarks: Li Si, a man of the lanes and alleys, after visiting the various feudal rulers, entered the service of Qin, and because of a fortunate opening in circumstances was able to act as aide to the First Emperor, helping him to become emperor and himself occupying one of the three highest ministerial posts. He may be said to have been highly honoured for his services. Li Si understood the principles underlying the Six Classics, yet he did not strive for enlightened government as a means of repairing the ruler’s defects. Instead, while clinging to his substantial title and stipend, he flattered and complied, whatever the demand, making government authority ever stricter and penalties harsher, heeding Zhao Gao’s evil advice and casting aside the rightful heir to set up a younger son by a concubine. After the feudal lords had already revolted, he finally made an effort to admonish and correct, but by then it was far too late. People all claim that Li Si exerted the utmost loyalty and in spite of that suffered death by the five penalties. But if we examine the root of the affair, we find it was very different from this popular appraisal. If he had truly been such a man, then his accomplishments would have been worthy to rank with those of the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao.
