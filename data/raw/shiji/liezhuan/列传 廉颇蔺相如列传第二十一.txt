廉颇者，赵之良将也。赵惠文王十六年，廉颇为赵将伐齐，大破之，取阳晋，拜为上卿，以勇气闻于诸侯。蔺相如者，赵人也，为赵宦者令缪贤舍人。
廉颇，是赵国杰出的将领。赵惠文王十六年（公元前283年），廉颇为赵国领兵攻打齐国，大败齐军，攻取了阳晋，被封为上卿，凭借自己的勇气闻名于诸侯。蔺相如，是赵国人，是赵国宦官头目缪贤的家臣。
Lian Po was an able general of Zhao. In the sixteenth year of King Huiwen, he commanded the Zhao army against Qi and defeated its troops, taking the city of Yangjin. Then he was made a chief minister and was known for his prowess to all the states. Lin Xiangru, a man of Zhao, was the steward of Mu Xian, the chief eunuch.

赵惠文王时，得楚和氏璧。秦昭王闻之，使人遗赵王书，愿以十五城请易璧。赵王与大将军廉颇诸大臣谋：欲予秦，秦城恐不可得，徒见欺；欲勿予，即患秦兵之来。计未定，求人可使报秦者，未得。宦者令缪贤曰：“臣舍人蔺相如可使。”王问：“何以知之?”对曰：“臣尝有罪，窃计欲亡走燕。臣舍人相如止臣曰：‘君何以知燕王?’”
赵惠文王时，得到了楚国的和氏璧。秦昭王听说了，派人给赵王送了一封信，想用十五座城来换取和氏璧。赵王和大将军廉颇等诸位大臣商量：想给秦国，而秦国的城池恐怕得不到，白白地被欺骗；想不给，又害怕秦军来攻打赵国。计谋还没有定下来，想寻找一个可以出使答复秦国的人，没有得到。宦官令缪贤说：“我的家臣蔺相如可以出使。”赵王问他：“你怎么知道的?”回答说：“我曾经犯了罪，偷偷地计划想逃跑到燕国去。我的家臣蔺相如劝阻我，说：‘您凭借什么知道燕王会收留您呢?’”
King Huiwen of Zhao had come into possession of the jade of Bian He, a man of Chu. When King Zhao of Qin knew this, he sent an envoy with a letter to the king of Zhao, offering fifteen cities in exchange for the jade. The king took counsel with General Lian Po and his chief ministers, who feared that if the jade were sent to Qin they might be cheated and get no cities in return, yet if they refused the soldiers of Qin might attack. They could neither hit on a plan nor find an envoy to take their answer to Qin. Then Mu Xian, the chief eunuch, said, “My steward Lin Xiangru would make a good envoy.” “How do you know?” asked the king. He replied, “Once I did something wrong and secretly planned to escape to Yan, but my steward stopped me, asking, ‘How can you be sure of the king of Yan?’”

臣语曰：‘臣尝从大王与燕王会境上，燕王私握臣手曰“愿结友”。以此知之，故欲往。’相如谓臣曰：‘夫赵强而燕弱，而君幸于赵王，故燕王欲结于君。今君乃亡赵走燕，燕畏赵，其势必不敢留君，而束君归赵矣。君不如肉袒伏斧质请罪，则幸得脱矣。’臣从其计，大王亦幸赦臣。臣窃以为其人勇士，有智谋，宜可使。”
我回答说：“我曾经跟随大王和燕王在边境上会面，燕王私下里和我握手，说‘希望结成好朋友’。因此我知道燕王对我很友好，所以想去燕国。”蔺相如对我说：“赵国强而燕国弱，而您受赵王宠幸，因此燕王对您很友好。如今您是从赵国逃到燕国去，燕国害怕赵国，势必不敢收留您，而会把您捆着送回赵国。您不如光着膀子伏在刀斧砧板上请罪，或许能够免罪。”我听从了他的计策，大王您也施恩赦免了我。我私下里认为这个人是勇士，而且有智谋，应该可以出使。”
I answered, “I met the king of Yan at the frontier with our king, and he privately grasped my hand and offered me his friendship. That is how I know, and why I mean to go there.” Lin said, “Zhao is strong and Yan is weak, and because you stood well with our lord the king of Yan desired your friendship. But if you now fly from Zhao to Yan, for fear of Zhao he will not dare to keep you and will have you sent back in chains. Your only possible way out is to bare your shoulder and prostrate yourself before the axe and block for punishment.” I took his advice and Your Majesty pardoned me. To my mind he is a brave, resourceful man, well fitted to be our envoy.”

于是王召见，问蔺相如曰：“秦王以十五城请易寡人之璧，可予不?”相如曰：“秦强而赵弱，不可不许。”王曰：“取吾璧，不予我城，奈何?”相如曰：“秦以城求璧而赵不许，曲在赵。赵予璧而秦不予赵城，曲在秦。均之二策，宁许以负秦曲。”
于是赵王召见他，问蔺相如说：“秦王想用十五座城来交换我的和氏璧，可以给他吗?”蔺相如说：“秦国强大而赵国弱小，不能不给。”赵王说：“秦国拿了我的和氏璧，却不给我城池，怎么办?”蔺相如说：“秦国用城换璧而赵国不答应，理亏的是赵国。而赵国给了和氏璧秦国却不给城，理亏的就是秦国了。比较两个方面，宁可答应秦国而使他们承担理亏的责任。”
The king thereupon summoned Lin Xiangru and asked him, “Should I accept the king of Qin's offer of fifteen cities in exchange for my jade?” “Qin is strong, we are weak,” replied Lin Xiangru. “We cannot refuse.” “What if he takes my jade but will not give me the cities?” “If we refuse Qin's offer of cities in exchange for the jade, that puts us in the wrong; but if we give up the jade and get no cities, that puts Qin in the wrong. Of these two courses, the better one is to agree and put Qin in the wrong.”

王曰：“谁可使者?”相如曰：“王必无人，臣愿奉璧往使。城入赵而璧留秦；城不入，臣请完璧归赵。”赵王于是遂遣相如奉璧西入秦。
赵王说：“谁可以出使?”蔺相如说：“大王如果真的没有人，我愿意捧着璧出使秦国。秦国的城划归了赵国，我就把璧留在秦国；秦国的城如果没有划归赵国，我一定完璧归赵。”于是赵王就派遣蔺相如捧着和氏璧西行入秦。
“Who can be our envoy?” “If Your Majesty has no one else, I will gladly take the jade and go on this mission. If the cities are given to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qin. If no cities are given, I shall bring the jade back unscathed.” So the king of Zhao sent Lin Xiangru with the jade west to Qin.

秦王坐章台见相如，相如奉璧奏秦王。秦王大喜，传以示美人及左右，左右皆呼万岁。相如视秦王无意偿赵城，乃前曰：“璧有瑕，请指示王!”
秦王坐在章台接见了蔺相如，蔺相如捧着和氏璧奏见秦王。秦王非常高兴，把和氏璧传给美人和手下人看，手下人都高呼万岁。蔺相如看到秦王没有偿还给赵国城邑的意思，就走上前说：“璧有小斑点，请让我为大王指出来!”
The king of Qin sat in his pleasure pavilion (Zhangtai) to receive Lin Xiangru, who presented the jade to him. The king, very pleased, had it shown to his ladies and attendants, and all his attendants cheered. Seeing that the king had no intention of giving any cities to Zhao, Lin Xiangru stepped forward and said, “There is a blemish on the jade. Let me show it to you, sir.”

王授璧。相如因持璧却立，倚柱，怒发上冲冠，谓秦王曰：“大王欲得璧，使人发书至赵王，赵王悉召群臣议，皆曰‘秦贪，负其强以空言求璧，偿城恐不可得’。议不欲予秦璧。臣以为布衣之交尚不相欺，况大国乎!且以一璧之故，逆强秦之欢，不可。于是赵王乃斋戒五日，使臣奉璧，拜送书于庭。何者?严大国之威以修敬也。”
秦王把璧给他。于是蔺相如拿着璧倒退几步站住，靠着柱子，怒发冲冠，对秦王说：“大王想得到和氏璧，让人送信给赵王，赵王召集所有的臣下商量，都说‘秦国贪心，倚仗它的强大，用空话求璧，补偿城邑恐怕得不到’。想要不给秦国和氏璧。我认为平民百姓的交往尚且不可以相互欺骗，何况堂堂大国呢!况且因为一块璧的原因而惹得秦国不高兴，不可取。因此赵王就斋戒五天，让我捧着璧，在朝堂上叩拜，送上国书。为什么呢?是尊敬大国的威严并表示敬意啊。”
As soon as the king gave him the jade, Lin Xiangru retreated to stand with his back to a pillar. His hair bristling with fury, he said, “To get this jade, great king, you sent a letter to the king of Zhao. When our sovereign summoned his ministers to discuss the matter, they said, ‘Qin is greedy and, relying on its strength, hopes to get our jade in return for empty promises. We are not likely to receive the cities.’ They were against giving you the jade. It seemed to me, however, that if even fellows in homespun can trust each other, how much more can powerful states. Besides, how wrong it would be to offend mighty Qin for the sake of a piece of jade! So the king of Zhao, after fasting for five days, sent me with a letter and the jade to your court. Why? To show the respect and awe in which we hold your great country.”

今臣至，大王见臣列观，礼节甚倨；得璧，传之美人，以戏弄臣。臣观大王无意偿赵王城邑，故臣复取璧。大王必欲急臣，臣头今与璧俱碎于柱矣!”相如持其璧睨柱，欲以击柱。
现在我来了，大王在一般的宫殿里接待我，礼节很傲慢；拿到璧以后，传给美人看，来戏弄我。我看大王实在没有偿还赵国城邑的意愿，因此我又把璧取回来。大王如果一定要逼我的话，我的头今天就会和璧一起碎在这柱子上!”蔺相如拿着璧斜视着柱子，准备用璧击柱。
Yet on my arrival you received me in a pleasure pavilion and treated me with contempt. You took the jade and passed it among your ladies to make a fool of me. I can see you have no intention of giving Zhao those cities in return, so I have taken back the jade. If you use force against me, I will smash my head and the jade against this pillar.” With that, glancing at the pillar, he raised the jade and threatened to smash it.

秦王恐其破璧，乃辞谢固请，召有司案图，指从此以往十五都予赵。相如度秦王特以诈详为予赵城，实不可得，乃谓秦王曰：“和氏璧，天下所共传宝也，赵王恐，不敢不献。赵王送璧时，斋戒五日，今大王亦宜斋戒五日，设九宾于廷，臣乃敢上璧。”
秦王害怕他撞坏了璧，就道歉并再三请求，召集有司查看地图，指出从这里以外的十五座城给赵国。蔺相如揣摩秦王只不过是设计假装给赵国城邑，实际上赵国还是拿不到，于是就对秦王说：“和氏璧，是天下共同传扬的宝物，赵王害怕，不敢不献给秦。赵王送出璧时，斋戒了五天，如今大王也应该斋戒五天，设置九宾礼于朝廷，我才敢献上璧。”
To save the jade, the king of Qin apologized and begged him to stop, then ordered the officer in charge to look up the map and point out the boundaries of the fifteen cities to be given to Zhao. Lin Xiangru, thinking this was a subterfuge and that Zhao would never really get the cities, declared, “The jade of Bian He is a treasure known throughout the world, but for fear of Qin the king of Zhao dared not withhold it. Before parting with it he fasted for five days. So it is only right, great king, that you too should fast for five days and then prepare a grand court reception (the Nine Rites). Only then dare I hand it over.”

秦王度之，终不可强夺，遂许斋五日，舍相如广成传。相如度秦王虽斋，决负约不偿城，乃使其从者衣褐怀其璧，从径道亡，归璧于赵。
秦王揣度这件事，终究不可以强夺，于是答应斋戒五天，让蔺相如住在广成公馆。蔺相如估计秦王虽然斋戒，肯定会违背约定不给赵国城邑，于是让他的随从穿着粗布衣服，怀揣着和氏璧，从小道逃走，把和氏璧送回了赵国。
Since he could not seize the jade by force, the king agreed to fast for five days, during which time Lin Xiangru should be lodged in the Guangcheng Hostel. Lin Xiangru suspected that despite his fast the king would not keep his promise to give the cities. So, dressing one of his followers in rags and concealing the jade on his person, he made him hurry back to Zhao by paths and byways, returning the jade to Zhao.

秦王斋五日后，乃设九宾礼于庭，引赵使者蔺相如。相如至，谓秦王曰：“秦自穆公以来二十余君，未尝有坚明约束者也。臣诚恐见欺于王而负赵，故令人持璧归，间至赵矣。且秦强而赵弱，大王遣一介之使至赵，赵立奉璧来，今以秦之强而先割十五都予赵，赵岂敢留璧而得罪于大王乎? 臣知欺大王之罪当诛，臣请就汤镬，惟大王与群臣孰计议之!” 秦王与群臣相视而嘻。左右或欲引相如去。秦王因曰：“今杀相如，终不能得璧也，而绝秦、赵之欢，不如因而厚遇之，使归赵，赵王岂以一璧之故欺秦邪!” 卒廷见相如，毕礼而归之。
秦王斋戒五天后，于是设九宾之礼于朝廷，接见赵国的使者蔺相如。蔺相如来到，对秦王说：“秦国自穆公以来二十多个君主，没有一个能够坚守盟约的。我实在害怕被大王欺骗而对不起赵国，所以让人把璧带回去了，如今已经从小路送回赵国了。况且秦国强大而赵国弱小，大王只派一个使者到赵国，赵国就立刻奉上了璧。现在秦国强大，却要先割让十五座城邑给赵国，赵国哪里敢私自留下和氏璧，从而得罪大王呢？我知道欺骗大王的罪当处死刑，我请求受汤镬之刑，但愿大王和群臣仔细商量这件事！” 秦王和群臣面面相觑，惊叹不已。左右有人想把蔺相如拖下去。秦王却说：“现在杀了蔺相如，终究也得不到璧，反而断绝了秦赵的友好，不如厚待他，让他回到赵国。赵王岂敢因为一块璧而欺骗秦国呢！” 于是就在朝廷上正式接见了蔺相如，行礼完毕后送他回国。
When the king of Qin had fasted for five days, he prepared a grand reception for Zhao’s envoy. Lin Xiangru, arriving, announced to the king: “Since the time of Duke Mu of Qin, not one of the twenty-odd princes of your state has kept faith. Fearful of being deceived by Your Majesty and letting my country down, I sent a man back with the jade. He should be in Zhao by now. Qin is strong and Zhao is weak. When you, great king, sent a single messenger to Zhao, we immediately brought the jade here. If your mighty state had first given us fifteen cities, we should not have dared offend you by keeping the jade. I know I deserve death for deceiving you and beg to be boiled in the cauldron. Consider this well with your ministers, great king!” The king and all his ministers gaped at each other. Some attendants prepared to drag Lin Xiangru away, but the king said: “Killing him now will not get us the jade but would spoil our relations with Zhao. Better treat him handsomely and send him back. The king of Zhao dare not risk offending Qin for the sake of a piece of jade.” Thereupon he entertained Lin Xiangru in his court, dismissing him when the ceremony was over.

相如既归，赵王以为贤大夫使不辱于诸侯，拜相如为上大夫。秦亦不以城予赵，赵亦终不予秦璧。其后秦伐赵，拔石城。明年，复攻赵，杀二万人。秦王使使者告赵王，欲与王为好会于西河外渑池。赵王畏秦，欲毋行。廉颇、蔺相如计曰：“王不行，示赵弱且怯也。”赵王遂行，相如从。廉颇送至境；与王诀曰：“王行，度道里会遇之礼毕，还，不过三十日。三十日不还，则请立太子为王，以绝秦望。”王许之，遂与秦王会渑池。秦王饮酒酣，曰：“寡人窃闻赵王好音，请奏瑟。”赵王鼓瑟。秦御史前书曰：“某年月日，秦王与赵王会饮，令赵王鼓瑟。”蔺相如前曰：“赵王窃闻秦王善为秦声，请奏盆秦王，以相娱乐。”
蔺相如已经回到赵国，赵王认为他是贤能的大夫，出使诸侯而不受辱，任命他为上大夫。秦国也不给赵国城邑，赵国最终也不给秦国和氏璧。之后秦国攻打赵国，攻占了石城。第二年，再攻打赵国，杀死二万人。秦王派使者告诉赵王，想和赵王在西河外的渑池会见言和。赵王害怕秦国，不想去。廉颇、蔺相如商量说：“大王不去，就表明赵国弱小而胆怯。”赵王于是前行，蔺相如跟从。廉颇送他们到边境上，和赵王辞别道：“大王前去，估计路程及会见礼节完毕，直到回来，不会超过三十天。三十天后不回来，就请让我立太子为王，以断绝秦国的贪心。”赵王答应了他，就去同秦王在渑池相见。秦王饮酒正酣，说：“我私下里听说赵王喜好音乐，请赵王弹瑟。”赵王弹瑟。秦国御史上前记载道：“某年某月某日，秦王与赵王一起饮酒，让赵王弹瑟。”蔺相如上前说：“赵王私下里听说秦王善于演奏秦声，请演奏盆声娱乐秦王。”
The king of Zhao was so pleased with the skill with which Lin Xiangru had saved the state from disgrace that he made him a high councillor on his return. Neither did Qin give the cities to Zhao, nor did Zhao give the jade to Qin. After this, Qin attacked Zhao and captured Shicheng. The following year, twenty thousand men of Zhao were killed in another attack. Then the king of Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao, proposing a friendly meeting at Minchi south of Xihe. The king of Zhao was reluctant to go, for fear of Qin. But Lian Po and Lin Xiangru reasoned with him, saying, “Not to go, sir, would make our country appear weak and cowardly.” So the king went, accompanied by Lin Xiangru. Lian Po escorted them to the frontier and bade the king farewell, saying, “I reckon that Your Majesty’s journey, the meeting, and the return should not take more than thirty days. If you fail to return in that time, I suggest appointing the crown prince as king to thwart Qin’s designs.” The king agreed and went to meet the king of Qin at Minchi. The king of Qin, merry after drinking, said, “I have privately heard that the king of Zhao enjoys music. Please play the cithern.” The king of Zhao played it. The Qin chronicler stepped forward and recorded, “On such-and-such a day, the king of Qin drank with the king of Zhao and ordered the king of Zhao to play the cithern.” Lin Xiangru then advanced and said, “The king of Zhao has privately heard that the king of Qin is skilled at Qin music, so he requests to play the pitcher-pitch tune to entertain the king.”

秦王怒，不许。于是相如前进緸，因跪请秦王。秦王不肯击瓴。相如曰：“五步之内，相如请得以颈血溅大王矣!”左右欲刃相如，相如张目叱之，左右皆靡。于是秦王不怿，为一击瓴。相如顾召赵御史书曰：“某年月日，秦王为赵王击瓴。”秦之群臣曰：“请以赵十五城为秦王寿!”蔺相如亦曰：“请以秦之咸阳为赵王寿!”秦王竟酒，终不能加胜于赵。赵亦盛设兵以待秦，秦不敢动。既罢归国，以相如功大，拜为上卿，位在廉颇之右。廉颇曰：“我为赵将，有攻城野战之大功，而蔺相如徒以口舌为劳，而位居我上，且相如素贱人，吾羞，不忍为之下。”宣言曰：“我见相如，必辱之。”相如闻，不肯与会。相如每朝时，常称病，不欲与廉颇争列。已而相如出，望见廉颇，相如引车避匿。于是舍人相与谏曰：“臣所以去亲戚而事君者，徒慕君之高义也。今君与廉颇同列，廉君宣恶言而君畏匿之，恐惧殊甚，且庸人尚羞之，况于将相乎!臣等不肖，请辞去。”
秦王发怒，不答应。于是蔺相如上前献上盆瓴，又跪着请求秦王演奏。秦王不肯击瓴。蔺相如说：“五步之内，我就要把脖子上的鲜血溅到大王身上了!”左右的人想要杀蔺相如，蔺相如瞪眼呵斥，他们都退开了。于是秦王不高兴，只敲了一下瓴。蔺相如回头召来赵国御史，记载道：“某年某月某日，秦王为赵王击瓴。”秦国群臣说：“请赵国用十五座城邑为秦王祝寿!”蔺相如也说：“请秦国用咸阳为赵王祝寿!”整个酒宴结束，秦王始终不能压服赵国。赵国又布置重兵防备秦国，秦国因此不敢轻举妄动。会见结束回到赵国后，赵王因蔺相如功劳卓著，任命他为上卿，职位在廉颇之上。廉颇说：“我作为赵国将军，在攻城野战上有大功，而蔺相如只是凭口舌立功，却位居我之上，而且蔺相如本是卑贱之人，我觉得羞耻，不能容忍他的职位在我之上。”并宣称：“我见到蔺相如，必定要羞辱他。”蔺相如听闻，不愿与廉颇同席。在每次朝会中，他常称病，不愿与廉颇争列。后来蔺相如出门，看见廉颇时，便引车避开隐藏。于是他的舍人劝谏说：“我们离开亲戚而事奉君主，是因为仰慕君的高义。如今您与廉颇同列，而廉颇说恶言，您又畏惧隐藏，恐惧极大；即使是普通人都会感到羞耻，何况是将相呢？我们这些不才的臣子，请求辞去。”
The king of Qin angrily refused. But Lin Xiangru went forward with the pitcher and, kneeling, requested the king to play. The king still refused. Lin Xiangru said, “Within five steps, I shall spatter my own blood onto Your Majesty!” The attendants wanted to attack Lin Xiangru, but he glared at them and shouted, and they all shrank back. The king of Qin, displeased, then struck the pitcher once. Lin Xiangru turned to summon the Zhao chronicler and recorded, “On such-and-such a date, the king of Qin played the pitcher for the king of Zhao.” The ministers of Qin said, “Let Zhao present fifteen cities to the king of Qin as a birthday gift!” Lin Xiangru replied, “Then let Qin present Xianyang to the king of Zhao as a birthday gift!” By the end of the banquet, the king of Qin had failed to dominate Zhao. Zhao had also deployed a strong army to guard against Qin, so Qin did not dare make a move. After returning to Zhao, the king appointed Lin Xiangru as chief minister for his great merit, placing him above Lian Po. Lian Po said, “I am a general of Zhao, with great achievements in siege and field battles, yet Lin Xiangru has only used his tongue to gain merit, and now ranks above me. Moreover, Lin Xiangru comes from a humble background. I feel ashamed and cannot tolerate being below him.” He proclaimed, “If I see Lin Xiangru, I will humiliate him.” Lin Xiangru heard of this and refused to attend the same gatherings as Lian Po. At court, he often feigned illness to avoid competing with Lian Po for precedence. Later, when Lin Xiangru went out and saw Lian Po, he deliberately avoided him. Then his attendants advised, “We serve our lord only out of admiration for your high virtue. Now that you are ranked alongside Lian Po, and he speaks ill of you while you shrink in fear, the shame is extreme; even ordinary men would feel ashamed, let alone generals and ministers. We, your unworthy attendants, request to resign.”

蔺相如固止之，曰：“公之视廉将军孰与秦王?”曰：“不若也。”相如曰：“夫以秦王之威，而相如廷叱之，辱其群臣，相如虽驽，独畏廉将军哉?顾吾念之，强秦之所以不敢加兵于赵者，徒以吾两人在也。今两虎共斗，其势不俱生。吾所以为此者，以先国家之急而后私仇也。”廉颇闻之，肉袒负荆，因宾客至蔺相如门谢罪，曰：“鄙贱之人，不知将军宽之至此”
蔺相如坚决阻止他们，说：“你们看廉颇将军和秦王，谁更厉害?”他们回答说：“秦王厉害。”蔺相如说：“像秦王那样威风，我还当廷叱责他，羞辱他的臣子，我蔺相如虽然笨拙，难道单单害怕廉颇将军吗?我这样考虑，是因为强大的秦国之所以不敢对赵用兵，只因为有我们两个人在。如今两虎发生争斗，势必不可能共存。我之所以这样做，是把国家的安危放在前面，把私怨放在后面。”廉颇听说以后，光着膀子背着荆条，由宾客带着来到蔺相如家门口谢罪，说：“我是鄙贱之人，不知道将军能宽容至此。”
Lin Xiangru firmly stopped them and asked, “In your eyes, General Lian Po or the king of Qin, who is more powerful?” They replied, “The king of Qin is more powerful.” Lin Xiangru said, “If, useless as I am, I can rebuke the mighty king of Qin in court and insult his ministers, why should I be afraid of General Lian Po? To my mind, the reason powerful Qin has not dared to attack Zhao is solely because of the two of us. Now if two tigers fight, both cannot survive. I act as I do because I put the state’s urgent matters before personal grudges.” When Lian Po heard this, he bared his shoulders, fastened a thorned switch to his back, and, accompanied by his attendants, went to Lin Xiangru’s gate to apologize, saying, “Contemptible boor that I am, I did not understand your magnanimity, sir!”

卒相与欢，为刎颈之交。是岁，廉颇东攻齐，破其一军。居二年，廉颇复伐齐幾,拔之。后三年，廉颇攻魏之防陵、安阳，拔之。后四年，蔺相如将而攻齐，至平邑而罢。其明年，赵奢破秦军阏与下。赵奢者，赵之田部吏也。收租税而平原君家不肯出租，奢以法治之，杀平原君用事者九人。平原君怒，将杀奢。奢因说曰：“君于赵为贵公子，今纵君家而不奉公则法削，法削则国弱，国弱则诸侯加兵。诸侯加兵，是无赵也，君安得有此富乎?以君之贵，奉公如法则上下平，上下平则国强，国强则赵固，而君为贵戚，岂轻于天下邪?”平原君以为贤，言之于王。王用之治国赋，国赋大平，民富而府库实。
终于相互和好，结成生死之交。那一年，廉颇向东攻打齐国，打败了齐国的一支军队。两年后，廉颇又攻打齐国的幾邑，并攻占它。三年后，廉颇攻打魏国的防陵和安阳，并攻占它们。四年后，蔺相如率军攻打齐国，到平邑就撤军。第二年，赵奢在阏与城下击败了秦军。赵奢是赵国负责田赋的官员。当平原君家不肯缴纳租税时，赵奢依法处理，杀掉了平原君家里管理事务的九个人。平原君十分愤怒，想要杀赵奢。赵奢劝说道：“您在赵国是贵公子，如果纵容家族而不守公法，法律被削弱，则国家会衰弱，国家衰弱则诸侯会用兵攻击赵国。一旦诸侯用兵，赵国就不复存在，您哪还有现在的财富呢?以您的尊贵身份，依法办事，则国内上下公平，上下公平则国家强盛，国家强盛则赵国稳固，而您作为贵戚，也不会被天下轻视。”平原君认为赵奢贤能，于是向赵王推荐他。赵王任命赵奢治理国家赋税，国家的赋税治理平稳，百姓富足，国库充实。
They became close friends, ready to die for each other. That year, Lian Po attacked Qi in the east and defeated one of its armies. Two years later he captured another city of Qi. Three years later he stormed Fangling and Anyang in Wei and seized them. Four years later Lin Xiangru led an army against Qi but withdrew after reaching Pingyi. The following year Zhao She defeated the Qin army at Yuyu. Zhao She was an official in charge of land taxation in Zhao. When Lord Pingyuan’s family refused to pay taxes, Zhao She enforced the law and executed nine stewards. Lord Pingyuan became angry and wanted to kill Zhao She. Zhao She reasoned with him, “You are a noble of Zhao, but if you let your family ignore the law, then the law is weakened, the state becomes weak, and other lords may invade. If Zhao falls, how will you preserve your wealth? If you, as a noble, follow the law, society will be just, the state strong, Zhao secure, and you as a royal relative will not be despised by the world.” Impressed by Zhao She’s wisdom, Lord Pingyuan recommended him to the king, who put him in charge of taxation. Under Zhao She’s management, taxes were fairly collected, the people prospered, and the treasury was full.

秦伐韩，军于阏舆。王召廉颇而问曰：“可救不?”对曰：“道远险狭，难救。”又召乐乘而问焉，乐乘对如廉颇言。又召问赵奢，奢对曰：“其道远险狭，譬之犹两鼠斗于穴中，将勇者胜。”王乃令赵奢将，救之。兵去邯郸三十里，而令军中曰：“有以军事谏者死!”秦军军武安西，秦军鼓噪勒兵，武安屋瓦尽振。军中侯有一人言急救武安，赵奢立斩之。坚壁，留二十八日不行，复益增垒。秦间来人，赵奢善食而遣之。间以报秦将，秦将大喜，曰：“夫去国三十里而军不行，乃增垒，阏舆非赵地也。”赵奢既已遣秦间，乃卷甲而趋。
赋税从此非常合理，百姓富足，国库充实。秦国攻打韩国，在阏舆驻军。赵王召来廉颇问：“可以救韩国吗?”廉颇回答说：“道路遥远，又险又窄，很难救。”又召来乐乘问，乐乘的回答和廉颇相同。再召问赵奢，赵奢说：“道路又远又狭，就像两只老鼠在洞中搏斗，勇者获胜。”赵王于是任命赵奢为将军，出兵救韩国。军队离邯郸三十里，赵奢向军中下令：“有敢对军事进谏者处死!”秦军驻扎在武安西，擂鼓呐喊，武安城的屋瓦都震动。一名侦察员说应急救武安，赵奢立即斩了他。赵军坚守营垒，停军二十八天不动，并进一步加固营垒。秦国的间谍来，赵奢好好招待他吃饭，并将其遣回。间谍将情况报告秦军将领，秦将大喜，说：“离赵都三十里而军队不行，还增加营垒，阏舆绝不会成为赵地。”赵奢遣返间谍后，让军队卸去铠甲继续行动。
Then Qin invaded Han and stationed an army at Yuyu. The king of Zhao summoned Lian Po and asked, “Can we go to their aid?” Lian Po replied, “The road is long and passes through dangerous, narrow terrain; it would be hard to rescue them.” The king also consulted Yue Sheng, who gave the same answer. Finally, Zhao She was consulted, and he said, “The way is long and narrow, like two rats fighting in a hole—the braver will prevail.” The king then appointed Zhao She as general to lead troops to rescue Han. When the army had traveled thirty li from Handan, Zhao She issued an order to his men: “Anyone who dares to criticize the campaign will be executed!” The Qin army was stationed west of Wuan. Their drumming and shouting made the tiles of Wuan vibrate. A scout suggested hastening to rescue Wuan, but Zhao She executed him on the spot. Zhao’s army fortified their camp, remained in place for twenty-eight days, and further strengthened the defenses. When a Qin spy arrived, Zhao She fed him well and sent him away. The spy reported this to the Qin general, who rejoiced: “Their army is only thirty li from their capital, yet they stop and strengthen their fortifications; Yuyu will never become Qin territory.” After sending back the spy, Zhao She ordered his troops to remove their armor and proceed.

二日一夜至，令善射者去阏舆五十里而军。军垒成，秦人闻之，悉甲而至。军士许历请以军事谏。赵奢曰：“内之!”许历曰：“秦人不意赵师至此，其来气盛，将军必厚集其阵以待之。不然，必败。”赵奢曰：“请受令。”许历曰：“请就铁质之诛。”赵奢曰：“胥后令邯郸。”许历复请谏，曰：“先据北山上者胜，后至者败。”赵奢许诺，即发万人趋之。秦兵后至，争山不得上，赵奢纵兵击之，大破秦军。秦军解而走，遂解阏舆之围而归。赵惠文王赐奢号为马服君，以许历为国尉。赵奢于是与廉颇、蔺相如同位。
赵奢迅速行军，两天一夜赶到前线，让擅长射箭的士兵在阏舆城外五十里驻军。营垒建立好后，秦军听说了，全军赶来。军士许历请求进谏，赵奢说：“请他进来。”许历说：“秦军没想到赵军到此，他们气势汹汹，将军应集中兵力等待他们，否则必败。”赵奢答应采纳。许历说：“请处以杀头之刑。”赵奢说：“等回到邯郸再处理。”许历又进谏：“先占北山者胜，后到者败。”赵奢答应，派一万人速取北山。秦军后到，争夺山头未能成功，赵奢遂发兵攻击，大败秦军。秦军解围逃走，赵奢解了阏舆之围并回国。赵惠文王封赵奢为马服君，任命许历为国尉，从此赵奢与廉颇、蔺相如地位相等。
Zhao She advanced at full speed and reached Yuyu in two days and one night, stationing his best archers fifty li from the city. After the camp was established, the Qin army, hearing of this, came in full force. An officer named Xu Li requested to offer military advice, and Zhao She said, “Bring him in.” Xu Li said, “The Qin army did not expect us to reach this far. Their morale is high. You must concentrate your troops to meet them, or we will be defeated.” Zhao She agreed. Xu Li said, “I beg to die by the axe if wrong.” Zhao She replied, “Wait until we return to Handan.” Xu Li further advised, “Whoever reaches the North Hill first will win; the latecomers will lose.” Zhao She approved and sent ten thousand men to seize the hill. The Qin troops arrived later and could not take the hill. Zhao She then launched an attack and decisively defeated the Qin army. The Qin troops retreated, and Zhao She lifted the siege of Yuyu and returned. King Huiwen of Zhao honored Zhao She with the title Lord of Mafu and appointed Xu Li as marshal. From then on, Zhao She ranked equal with Lian Po and Lin Xiangru.

后四年，赵惠文王卒，子孝成王立。七年，秦与赵兵相距长平。时赵奢已死，而蔺相如病笃。赵使廉颇将攻秦，秦数败赵军，赵军固壁不战。秦数挑战，廉颇不肯。赵王信秦之间。秦之间言曰：“秦之所恶，独畏马服君赵奢之子赵括为将耳。”赵王因以括为将，代廉颇。蔺相如曰：“王以名使括，若胶柱而鼓瑟耳。括徒能读其父书传，不知合变也。”赵王不听，遂将之。赵括自少时学兵法，言兵事，以天下莫能当。尝与其父奢言兵事，奢不能难，然不谓善。括母问奢其故，奢曰：“兵，死地也，而括易言之。使赵不将括即已，若必将之，破赵军者必括也。”及括将行，其母上书言于王曰：“括不可使将。”王曰：“何以?”对曰：“始妾事其父，当时为将，身所奉饭饮而进食者以百数，大王及宗室所赏赐者尽以予军吏士大夫，受命之日，不问家事。今括一旦为将，东向而朝，军吏无敢仰视之者，王所赐金帛，归藏于家，而日视便利田宅，可买者买之。王以为何如其父?父子异心，愿王勿遣!”王曰：“母置之，吾已决矣!”括母因曰：“王终遣之，即有如不称，妾得无随坐乎?”王许诺。
四年后，赵惠文王去世，儿子孝成王即位。孝成王七年，秦赵两国在长平对阵。此时赵奢已死，蔺相如病重。赵王派廉颇率军攻秦，秦军屡次击败赵军，赵军坚守营垒不出战。秦军屡次挑战，廉颇不肯应战。赵王相信了秦国的反间谍之计。秦国的间谍说：“秦国只是害怕马服君赵奢的儿子赵括做将军。”赵王于是任命赵括为将军，代替廉颇。蔺相如说：“大王凭名声任命赵括，好比把弦柱用胶固定再弹琴。赵括只会读父亲的兵书，不懂随机应变。”赵王不听，坚持派赵括出征。赵括自小学习兵法，自诩无人能敌，曾与父亲赵奢论兵，赵奢虽无法反驳，但未称赞。赵括的母亲问原因，赵奢说：“用兵是生死大事，而赵括谈兵轻率。如果不任他为将还好，一旦任他出征，破赵军的必是他。”赵括出征前，他母亲上书劝王不要任命。赵王问原因，她说：“我侍奉其父时，他为将军，亲自端饭款待数百人，将王及宗室赏赐尽分给军吏士大夫，受命时不理家务。如今赵括做将，面对士兵指挥，军官不敢正眼看他，将王所赏赐之物收归家中，每天寻找可买田宅。王以为他与其父相比如何？父子心志不同，望王勿派。”赵王说：“母亲勿管，我已决定。”母亲又问：“若派他出征，不称职，妾可否不受牵连？”赵王允诺。
Four years later, King Huiwen of Zhao died and his son King Xiaocheng ascended the throne. In the seventh year of his reign, Qin and Zhao confronted each other at Changping. By then Zhao She had died and Lin Xiangru was gravely ill. Zhao sent Lian Po to lead the army against Qin. The Qin army repeatedly defeated Zhao’s forces, and Zhao’s army remained behind fortifications, refusing to fight. Repeatedly challenged, Lian Po refused to engage. The king trusted Qin spies, who said, “All Qin fears is Zhao Kuo, the son of Lord Zhao She of Mafu.” The king appointed Zhao Kuo to replace Lian Po. Lin Xiangru protested, “If Your Majesty appoints him based on his father’s reputation, it is like gluing the frets of a cithern before playing. Zhao Kuo only knows his father’s writings; he cannot adapt.” The king ignored him. Zhao Kuo had studied military science since childhood, claiming no one could surpass him. Once he debated strategy with his father, who could not refute him, yet did not praise him. When Zhao Kuo’s mother asked why, Zhao She said, “War is a matter of life and death, yet he speaks lightly. If Zhao does not appoint him, fine; if appointed, the army’s defeat will be his fault.” Before Zhao Kuo’s departure, his mother wrote to the king urging him not to send him. She explained that Zhao Kuo, unlike his father, treated officers with arrogance, appropriated royal gifts, and neglected duties. The king replied, “Mother, leave it; I have decided.” She asked, “If he fails, may I be spared blame?” The king promised.

赵括既代廉颇，悉更约束，易置军吏。秦将白起闻之，纵奇兵，详败走，而绝其粮道，分断其军为二，士卒离心。四十余日，军饿，赵括出锐卒自搏战，秦军射杀赵括。括军败，数十万之众遂降秦，秦悉坑之。赵前后所亡凡四十五万。明年，秦兵遂围邯郸岁余，几不得脱。
赵括代替廉颇做将军后，全面改变法令，更换军吏。秦将白起得知后，派奇兵，假装败退，切断赵军粮道，将军队一分为二，使士兵士气涣散。四十多天后，赵军缺粮，赵括亲自带精锐士兵出战，秦军射杀赵括。赵军大败，数十万士兵投降秦军，秦军全部活埋。赵国前后损失士兵约四十五万。次年，秦军围攻邯郸一年多，几乎无法脱困。
After Zhao Kuo replaced Lian Po, he rescinded all prior orders and replaced the officers. When the Qin general Bai Qi learned of this, he sent a surprise force, feigned a retreat, cut off Zhao’s supply lines, and split the army into two, demoralizing the troops. After more than forty days, Zhao’s forces were starving. Zhao Kuo led his elite troops personally into battle but was shot and killed by the Qin army. Zhao’s army was utterly defeated; hundreds of thousands surrendered and were buried alive by Qin. Zhao lost approximately 450,000 soldiers in total. The following year, Qin besieged Handan for over a year, nearly capturing it.

赖楚、魏诸侯来救，乃得解邯郸之围。赵王亦以括母先言，竟不诛也。自邯郸围解五年，而燕用栗腹之谋，曰“赵壮者尽于长平，其孤未壮”，举兵击赵。赵使廉颇将，击，大破燕军于部，杀栗腹，遂围燕。燕割五城请和，乃听之。赵以尉文封廉颇为信平君，为假相国。廉颇之免长平归也，失势之时，故客尽去。及复用为将，客又复至。廉颇曰：“客退矣!”客曰：“唉!君何见之晚也?夫天下以市道交，君有势，我则从君，君无势，则去。此固其理也，有可怨乎?”
邯郸被围长达一年多，几乎难以脱险。靠楚、魏等诸侯出兵救援，才解围。赵王也因赵括母亲事先劝言，最终没有处死她。自邯郸围解五年后，燕国采纳宰相栗腹的计谋，说：“赵国的壮年士兵几乎都死在长平，孤儿尚未成年。”便举兵攻赵。赵派廉颇为将，迎战大败燕军于部，杀栗腹，并围攻燕国。燕国割让五座城以求和，赵王才同意。赵王将尉文邑封给廉颇，称信平君，并代理相国。廉颇从长平免职回来，势力衰微时，门客皆去。复任将军后，门客又回，廉颇说：“你们退下吧。”宾客答：“唉！君怎么才明白呢？天下交情如市场交易，君有权势，我们随从；君失势，我们离开，这是常理，有何可怨？”
The siege of Handan lasted over a year and was nearly disastrous. Only with reinforcements from the states of Chu and Wei was the city relieved. The King of Zhao did not execute Zhao Kuo’s mother because of her prior warning. Five years after the relief, Yan attacked Zhao following the advice of its minister Li Fu, who said, “All Zhao’s able-bodied men were killed at Changping; their orphans are not yet grown.” Zhao appointed Lian Po as commander, who routed Yan’s forces at Hao, killed Li Fu, and laid siege to Yan. Yan offered five cities in peace, which Zhao accepted. Zhao rewarded Lian Po with the district of Weiwen, titled him Lord Xinping, and made him acting chief minister. When Lian Po returned from Changping, his protégés had left during his fall from power. When he was reappointed, they returned. Lian Po said, “Go back, all of you!” They replied, “Alas! Why do you realize it so late? All friendships follow the market: when you have power we follow, when you have none we leave. This is natural; why complain?”

居六年，赵使廉颇伐魏之繁阳，拔之。赵孝成王卒，子悼襄王立，使乐乘代廉颇。廉颇怒，攻乐乘，乐乘走。廉颇遂奔魏之大梁。其明年，赵乃以李牧为将而攻燕，拔武遂、方城。廉颇居梁久之，魏不能信用。赵以数困于秦兵，赵王思复得廉颇，廉颇亦思复用于赵。赵王使使者视廉颇尚可用否。廉颇之仇郭开多与使者金，令毁之。赵使者既见廉颇，廉颇为之一饭斗米，肉十斤，被甲上马，以示尚可用。赵使还报王曰：“廉将军虽老，尚善饭，然与臣坐，顷之三遗矢矣。”赵王以为老，遂不召。楚闻廉颇在魏，阴使人迎之。廉颇一为楚将，无功，曰：“我思用赵人。”廉颇卒死于寿春。
六年后，赵国派廉颇攻打魏国繁阳，攻下此地。赵孝成王去世，其子悼襄王即位，用乐乘代替廉颇为将。廉颇生气，攻打乐乘，乐乘逃走，廉颇遂投奔魏国大梁。次年，赵国派李牧为将攻燕，攻下武遂、方城。廉颇在魏久居，但魏国不信任他。赵国因多次被秦军围困，赵王希望重新起用廉颇，廉颇也希望回赵。赵王派使者前去探查，廉颇的仇人郭开贿送使者金钱诋毁他。但使者见到廉颇时，廉颇吃了一斗米和十斤肉，并披甲上马，以示自己尚可服役。使者回报说：“廉将军虽老，但食量尚可；与我同坐，一会儿就排三次便。”赵王认为他年老，不再召回。楚国得知廉颇在魏，暗中派人接他。廉颇曾作为楚将无功而归，说：“我想统领赵军。”廉颇最后死在寿春。
Six years later, Zhao sent Lian Po to capture Fanyang in Wei, which he successfully took. After King Xiaocheng of Zhao died, his son King Daoxiang ascended and appointed Yue Sheng to replace Lian Po. In anger, Lian Po attacked Yue Sheng, who fled. Lian Po then went to Daliang in Wei. The following year Zhao appointed Li Mu to attack Yan, capturing Wusui and Fangcheng. Lian Po stayed in Wei for many years but was not trusted. Zhao, having been repeatedly besieged by Qin, wished to recall him; Lian Po also wished to serve Zhao again. The king sent an envoy to assess him, but an enemy, Guo Kai, bribed the envoy to slander him. When the envoy met Lian Po, he ate a peck of rice and ten catties of meat, donned armor, and mounted his horse to show his fitness. The envoy reported, “Although old, General Lian Po still has a good appetite, but he relieved himself three times while I was present.” The king considered him too old to summon. Chu heard Lian Po was in Wei and secretly invited him. As a general of Chu, he achieved nothing, saying, “I wish to command Zhao’s troops.” Lian Po eventually died in Shouchun.

李牧者，赵之北边良将也。常居代雁门，备匈奴。以便宜置吏，市租皆输入莫府，为士卒费。日击数牛飨士，习射骑，谨烽火，多间谍，厚遇战士。为约曰：“匈奴即入盗，急入收保，有敢捕虏者斩!”匈奴每入，烽火谨，辄入收保，不敢战。如是数岁，亦不亡失。然匈奴以李牧为怯，虽赵边兵亦以为吾将怯。赵王让李牧，李牧如故。赵王怒，召之，使他人代将。岁余，匈奴每来，出战。出战，数不利，失亡多，边不得田畜。复请李牧。牧杜门不出，固称疾。赵王乃复强起使将兵。曰：“王必用臣，臣如前，乃敢奉令。”王许之。
李牧是赵国北方边境的名将，常驻代郡和雁门以防匈奴入侵。他根据实际情况任命官吏，将市场税收送入军府供士兵使用。每天宰几头牛犒劳士兵，训练骑射，严守烽火台，派出很多间谍，厚待士兵。他立下规矩：“匈奴若入侵抢掠，迅速撤入堡垒防守，敢抓俘虏者斩！”匈奴每次入侵，赵军谨慎防守，从不交战，数年无损失。然而匈奴仍认为李牧胆怯，连边军士兵也以为将领胆小。赵王责备李牧，他依旧从前行事。赵王生气，召回他，让别人代替指挥。一年多来，匈奴每次入侵赵军都出战，结果屡战屡败，损失惨重，边境无法耕种畜牧。赵国再次请李牧出任将领，他闭门称病推辞，直到赵王再次派他出征。李牧说：“大王若用我，我如旧才能奉命。”赵王同意。
Li Mu was an able general on Zhao’s northern frontier, stationed in Dai and Yanmen to defend against the Huns. He appointed officers as needed, directing market taxes to army headquarters for soldier expenses. Each day he slaughtered several oxen to reward soldiers, trained them in mounted archery, strictly guarded beacons, deployed many spies, and treated his soldiers well. He decreed: “If the Huns raid, retreat quickly to the fort. Anyone who engages them will be executed.” Whenever the Huns raided, Zhao forces withdrew carefully without fighting, suffering no losses for several years. Yet the Huns still considered Li Mu cowardly, as did some Zhao frontier troops. The king reprimanded him, but he continued as before. Angered, the king recalled him, appointing another to command. For over a year, Zhao troops were repeatedly defeated by the Huns and could not farm or tend livestock on the frontier. Zhao requested Li Mu again. He closed his doors, claiming illness, until the king insisted. Li Mu said, “If Your Majesty insists, I will serve as before.” The king agreed.
