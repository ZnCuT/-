伍子胥者，楚人也，名员。员父曰伍奢。员兄曰伍尚。其先曰伍举，以直谏事楚庄王,有显,故其后世有名于楚。
伍子胥是楚国人，名员。他的父亲叫伍奢，哥哥叫伍尚。他的先人有个叫伍举的，曾经以直谏闻名，在楚庄王驾前做过事，功业显达，所以他的后代在楚国便成了一个有名望的家族。
Wu Zixu,or Wu Yuan,was a native of Chu.His father was Wu She,his elder brother Wu Shang.Their ancestor Wu Chu had been noted for his frank advice to King Zhuang of Chu,and so his descen-dants were well-known in that state.

楚平王有太子名曰建,使伍奢为太傅,费无忌为少傅。无忌不忠于太子建。平王使无忌为太子取妇于秦,秦女好，无忌驰归报平王曰：“秦女绝美，王可自取，而更为太子取妇。"平王遂自取秦女而绝爱幸之，生子轸。更为太子取妇。
楚平王的太子名建，楚平王让伍奢做太子的太傅，让费无忌做少傅，一起在太子身边服务。但费无忌对太子建不忠。楚平王让费无忌到秦国去给太子迎亲，费无忌看到这位秦国女子长得好，于是赶紧跑回来向楚平王报告说：“秦国女子长得太好了，您可以自己留下，而给太子另找一个。”于是楚平王果然就自己要了这个秦国女子，对她特别宠爱，和她生了一个儿子，名轸。而给太子另娶了一个媳妇。
King Ping of Chu appointed Wu She senior guardian to Crown Prince Jian,with Fei Wuji as junior guardian.Fei was not loyal to the prince,however.Sent to Qin by the king to bring back a wife for the prince and finding her very lovely,he galloped back to report,"This girl from Qin is a marvellous beauty.Your Majesty had better take her yourself and find another wife for the crown prince.”So King Ping took the girl,who became his favourite and gave birth to a son Zhen,while a different bride was found for the crown prince.

无忌既以秦女自媚于平王，因去太子而事平王。恐一旦平王卒而太子立，杀己，乃因谗太子建。建母，蔡女也,无宠于平王。平王稍益疏建,使建守城父,备边兵。
费无忌通过娶秦女这件事讨好了楚平王，于是就离开了太子，到楚平王身边去做事了。但是他担心一旦平王去世，太子立为楚王，自己会被杀头，于是就在平王面前说太子的坏话。太子建的母亲是一个蔡国的女子，平王本来就不喜欢她，又听了费无忌的谗言，于是对太子建越来越疏远，派他带兵去镇守北部的城父要塞，保卫楚国的边防。
Since Fei had pleased the king in this matter,he left the crown prince and entered the king's service.But fearing that when the king died and Jian ascended the throne he might be killed,he began to slander Jian.As the king did not love the crown prince's mother,who was from Cai,he gradually became estranged from Jian,whom he sent to guard the frontier city of Chengfu.

顷之，无忌又日夜言太子短于王曰：“太子以秦女之故，不能无怨望,愿王少自备也。自太子居城父，将兵，外交诸侯，且欲入为乱矣。”平王乃召其太傅伍奢考问之。伍奢知无忌谗太子于平王，因曰：“王独奈何以谗贼小臣疏骨肉之亲乎?”无忌曰：“王今不制，其事成矣。王且见禽。”于是平王怒，囚伍奢，而使城父司马奋扬往杀太子。行未至,奋扬使人先告太子：“太子急去，不然将诛。”太子建亡奔宋。
过不多久，费无忌又不分昼夜地在平王面前给太子编造坏话说：“太子没有娶到秦国女子，他的心里不能没有怨恨，希望您要有所防备。太子自打镇守城父以来，领兵在外，广交诸侯，他就要带兵杀回来造反了。”平王一听，就派人把太子的太傅伍奢叫了回来，向他盘问。伍奢知道这是费无忌在平王面前说了太子坏话的缘故，就气愤地回答说：“大王为什么要相信说坏话害人的奴才的挑拨，而疏远自己的亲骨肉呢?”费无忌则怂恿平王说：“大王要是不先发制人，等他们叛乱成功，您就会被他们捉去了。”平王大怒，立即囚禁了伍奢，而让城父守军的司马奋扬去捕杀太子。奋扬知道太子冤枉，就提前派人通知太子说：“太子快逃跑，不然就要被杀掉了。”太子建得讯，出逃到了宋国。
Soon Fei was belittling Jian day and night to the king. "The crown prince naturally resents losing his bride from Qin,"he said.“I must beg Your Majesty to be on your guard.Now the prince is in command of an army at Chengfu and in contact with other states,he may make trouble."King Ping summoned the senior guardian Wu She and asked him about it.Wu She,knowing of Fei's slander,told the king,"Don’t let yourself be estranged from your own flesh and blood,sir,by a petty treacherous slanderer."Fei insisted,"Unless you stop them,they will succeed.And then you will be trapped.”So the king in his anger had Wu She imprisoned.He ordered FenYang,the military commander at Chengfu,to kill the crown prince,but instead Fen Yang sent a man to warn Jian,saying,"Fly for your life,or you are lost!"So Prince Jian fled to Song.

无忌言于平王曰：“伍奢有二子，皆贤，不诛且为楚忧。可以其父质而召之，不然且为楚患。” 王使使谓伍奢曰：“能致汝二子则生，不能则死。” 伍奢曰：“尚为人仁，呼必来。员为人刚戾忍询，能成大事，彼见来之并禽，其势必不来。”
这时费无忌又跟楚平王说：“伍奢有两个儿子，都很能干，不杀了他们，将来都是楚国的祸害。我们可以用他们的父亲作人质，把他们骗来一起杀掉，不然后患无穷。” 于是楚平王就派人去对伍奢说：“能把你的两个儿子叫来就饶了你，叫不来就把你杀掉。” 伍奢说：“伍尚秉性仁慈，我叫他，他一定来；伍员则刚烈倔强能忍受耻辱，能成大事，他知道来了会一起被杀，肯定不会来的。”
Fei Wuji told the king,"Wu She has two sons,both able.If you do not eliminate them they will cause Chu trouble.With their father as hostage you can summon them.Failing this,they will be a menace to our state."Then the king sent word to Wu She,“Get your two sons here and you shall live.Otherwise you die.”“Shang has a good heart and would come,"replied Wu She.“But Zixu has a hard character,can stand abuse and is capable of great things.When he sees this is a trap,he will not come.”

王不听，使人召二子曰：“来，吾生汝父；不来，今杀奢也。” 伍尚欲往，员曰：“楚之召我兄弟，非欲以生我父也，恐有脱者后生患，故以父为质，诈召二子。二子到，则父子俱死。何益父之死？往而令仇不得报耳。不如奔他国，借力以雪父之耻，俱灭，无为也。”
平王不信，派人去对伍氏兄弟说：“如果你们来了，我就放了你们的父亲；如果你们不来，我就立刻把你们的父亲杀掉。” 伍尚一听马上想回去。伍员说：“楚王之所以叫我们回去，并不是想给我们父亲留下活命，而是怕我们跑了，以后给他们闹乱子，所以才用父亲作人质，来骗我们。如果我们回去，就只有父子三人一起被杀。这对于父亲的死又有什么好处呢？白白地落一个没有人给父亲报仇。还不如我们一起逃奔别的国家，向别的国家借兵来给父亲报仇。回去和父亲一块死，有什么意义呢？”
The king paid no attention but sent for both sons,saying,“Come, and your father lives.Otherwise he must die.”Shang wanted to obey the summons but Zixu reasoned,"The king has no intention of sparing our father but has sent for us because he is afraid of the trouble we may cause if we escape.He is holding our father as hostage in order to trick us.If we go we shall all die together what good would that do our father?We should simply lose all chance of revenge.No,better escape to another state and enlist support to avenge him.There is no point in perishing together."

伍尚曰：“我知往终不能全父命。然恨父召我以求生而不往，后不能雪耻，终为天下笑耳。” 谓员：“可去矣！汝能报杀父之仇，我将归死。” 尚既就执，使者捕伍胥。伍胥贯弓执矢向使者，使者不敢进，伍胥遂亡。闻太子建之在宋，往从之。
伍尚说：“我也知道回去救不了父亲，但我怕的是今天父亲叫我回去我没有回去，日后我也没有给父亲报仇，结果落一个被天下人耻笑。” 他对伍员说：“你可以逃走！因为你日后肯定能报这场杀父之仇，我准备回去和父亲一道死。” 说罢伍尚遂束手被擒了。来人又想逮捕伍子胥。伍子胥弯弓搭箭，对准来人，来人不敢靠近，伍子胥乘势逃走了。他听说太子建这时正逃亡在宋国，于是他也去了宋国。
"I know I cannot save him by going,"Shang rejoined.“But I don't want to be sneered at by the whole world for staying away to save my own skin and perhaps failing later to avenge him."He added,"You leave!You can avenge our father while I die with him."With Shang in their hands,the messengers tried to seize Zixu,but he fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed it at them so that they dared not advance.Thus he escaped.Hearing that the crown prince was in Song,he went there to join him.

奢闻子胥之亡也，曰：“楚国君臣且苦兵矣。” 伍尚至楚，楚并杀奢与尚也。
伍奢听说伍子胥逃跑了，感叹地说：“楚国的君臣们将来要吃兵火之苦了。” 伍尚被押到郢都后，楚王把伍奢和伍尚都杀掉了。
When Wu She learned of Zixu's flight he said,"Now the king of Chu and his ministers face military disaster.”As soon as Shang returned,he was put to death with his father.

伍胥既至宋，宋有华氏之乱,乃与太子建俱奔于郑。郑人甚善之。太子建又适晋,晋顷公曰:“太子既善郑，郑信太子。太子能为我内应，而我攻其外，灭郑必矣。灭郑而封太子。”太子乃还郑。事未会,会自私欲杀其从者，从者知其谋，乃告之于郑。郑定公与子产诛杀太子建。建有子名胜。伍胥惧，乃与胜俱奔吴。到昭关，昭关欲执之。伍胥遂与胜独身步走，几不得脱。追者在后。至江，江上有一渔父乘船，知伍胥之急，乃渡伍胥。伍胥既渡，解其剑曰：“此剑直百金,以与父。”父曰：“楚国之法，得伍胥者赐粟五万石，爵执珪”,岂徒百金剑邪!”不受。伍胥未至吴而疾，止中道，乞食。至于吴，吴王僚方用事,公子光为将。伍胥乃因公子光以求见吴王。
伍子胥逃到宋国后，正赶上华亥等人发动叛乱，于是伍子胥就和太子建一起离开了宋国转到了郑国。郑国人对他们很好。后来太子建到晋国访问，晋顷公对太子建说：“你和郑国的关系好，郑国人相信你，如果你能为我做内应，我从外面往里打，就一定可以灭掉郑国。灭郑国后，我就把那块地盘封给你，立你为君。”太子答应后返回了郑国。事情还没办，恰巧赶上太子想杀他的一个侍从，而这个侍从知道太子勾结晋国企图灭郑的阴谋，于是就逃出来把事情报告了郑国。郑定公和大夫子产一听立刻就把太子建抓起来杀掉了。这时太子建有个儿子名胜，伍子胥害怕受牵连，就和太子的儿子胜一起逃到了吴国。中途经过楚、吴交界的昭关时，昭关的守吏想逮捕他们，伍子胥和太子的儿子胜只好丢弃了车马从人，单身步行，差点被人家逮住。追兵一直在后边跟着，伍子胥逃到江边，见江上有一个渔父摇船。渔父知道伍子胥正急着避难，于是就把他渡了过去。伍子胥过江后，解下了身上的佩剑，对渔父说：“这把宝剑价值百金，我把它送给你吧。”渔父说：“楚国早有悬赏，谁能抓到伍子胥，赏给他粮食五万石，赐爵为‘执珪’,那些难道只值百金吗?”渔父没有接受伍子胥的酬谢。伍子胥还没到达吴国首都就病倒了，半道上只好停下来，以乞讨为生。伍子胥终于到达了吴国首都，吴国当时正是王僚执政，公子光为将军。于是，伍子胥就通过公子光见到了吴王。
After Wu Zixu reached Song there was a revolt led by Hua Hai,so Wu Zixu and Prince Jian went on to Zheng,where they were well received.Then PrinceJian visited Jin. Duke Qing of Jin said,"You are a good friend of Zheng and trusted there.If you help from within while I attack from without,I can certainly conquer Zheng and give it to you.” The prince returned to Zheng.But before the plan was carried out he made an attempt on the life of one of his followers against whom he had a grudge,and this man,knowing the plot,informed against him.Then Duke Ding of Zheng and his minister Zichan killed Prince Jian. The prince had left a son named Sheng,with whom Wu Zixu fled in alarm to Wu.The guards at the Zhao Pass tried to arrest them and, being on foot,they were very nearly caught.With pursuers hot behind them they reached the river,where a fisherman who saw that their case was desperate ferried them across in his boat.On the further shore,Wu Zixu unbuckled his sword. "This sword,worth a hundred gold pieces,I leave with you,"he said. The fisherman answered,"A reward of fifty thousand piculs of grain and a noble title has been offered in Chu to the man who captures Wu Zixu.Why should I take a sword worth only a hundred gold pieces?”And he refused it. On the way to Wu,Wu Zixu fell ill and had to stop to beg for food.When he reached Wu,King Liao was on the throne with Lord Guang as his commander,and through him Wu Zixu obtained an au- dience with the king.

久之，楚平王以其边邑钟离与吴边邑卑梁氏俱蚕,两女子争桑相攻，乃大怒，至于两国举兵相伐。吴使公子光伐楚，拔其钟离、居巢而归。伍子胥说吴王僚曰：“楚可破也。愿复遣公子光。”公子光谓吴王曰：“彼伍胥父兄为戮于楚，而劝王伐楚者，欲以自报其雠耳。伐楚未可破也。”伍胥知公子光有内志,欲杀王而自立，未可说以外事，乃进专诸于公子光,退而与太子建之子胜耕于野。
过了很长一段时间，楚国边境钟离县的女子和邻境吴国卑梁邑的女子因为养蚕采桑发生了殴斗，进而发展成了楚、吴两个国家的边境战争。吴国派公子光率兵伐楚，攻占了楚国的钟离、居巢两座县城。这时伍子胥对吴王僚说：“看此情形，可以打败楚国。大王可以派公子光再次出兵。”公子光说：“伍子胥的父亲、哥哥都是被楚王杀的，他劝大王伐楚，是为了给他的家族报仇。楚国现在是难以打败的。”伍子胥知道公子光有个人野心，他是想杀掉吴王而自立，在这种情况下，不可能劝他对外用兵，于是找来了一个勇士名叫专诸，把他推荐给公子光，而后自己就和太子建的儿子胜去隐居农耕，徐以待变了。
Some time later,the women raising silkworms in Wu's frontier town of Beiliangshi started fighting about mulberry leaves with those in Chu's frontier town Zhongli.King Ping of Chu was so incensed by this that he called out his troops,and the king of Wu sent Lord Guang to attack Chu.Upon his return after storming Zhongli and Juchao,Wu Zixu advised the king,“Chu can be defeated if you send Lord Guang out on another expedition.” But Lord Guang told the king,"Wu Zixu's father and brother were killed in Chu.He is advisingyou to attack because he wants revenge. We cannot defeat Chu." Wu Zixu knew that Lord Guang was plotting to kill the king and take his place,and that therefore it was useless to speak to him about matters outside.So he introduced Zhuan Zhu to Lord Guang and went into retirement himself ploughing the fields with Sheng,the son of Prince Jian.

五年而楚平王卒。初，平王所夺太子建秦女生子轸，及平王卒，轸竟立为后，是为昭王。吴王僚因楚丧，使二公子将兵往袭楚。楚发兵绝吴兵之后，不得归。吴国内空，而公子光乃令专诸袭刺吴王僚而自立,是为吴王阖庐。阖庐既立,得志，乃召伍员以为行人，而与谋国事。
五年后，楚平王死了。当初楚平王所夺的那个应该属于太子建的秦女，生了个儿子名轸，平王死后，其子轸就继承了王位，这就是楚昭王。这时吴王看到楚国正忙于办理丧事，就趁机派他的两个弟弟率兵伐楚。不想这支吴军被楚军截断了退路，回不来了。吴国内部空虚，公子光就趁机会派专诸刺杀了吴王僚，自立为王，这就是吴王阖庐。阖庐当了吴王，心满意足了，就召来伍子胥，任命他为行人，让他参与国家大事的决策。
Five years later King Ping of Chu died and Zhen,his son by the beauty from Qin,succeeded him as King Zhao.King Liao of Wu seized this opportunity to dispatch two lords with troops against Chu,but the army of Chucut off their retreat so that Wuwas left undefended. Then Lord Guang made Zhuan Zhu assassinate the king and set him- self up as King Helü.His ambition realized,he put Wu Zixuin charge of relations with other states and consulted him on government affairs.

楚诛其大臣邵宛、伯州犁,伯州犁之孙伯豁亡奔吴，吴亦以豁为大夫。前王僚所遣二公子将兵伐楚者，道绝不得归。后闻阖庐弑王僚自立，遂以其兵降楚，楚封之于舒。阖庐立三年,乃兴师与伍胥、伯豁伐楚，拔舒，遂禽故吴反二将军。因欲至郢,将军孙武曰:“民劳，未可，且待之。”乃归。
这时楚国又杀了大臣邵宛和伯州犁，伯州犁的孙子伯話也逃到了吴国，吴王阖庐任命他为大夫。当初吴王僚派去伐楚因退路被截断不能回来的那两位公子，听说阖庐杀了王僚自立了，就率兵投降了楚国，楚王把他们封在了舒县。阖庐自立后的第三年，便与伍子胥、伯部等人一起出兵伐楚，攻克了舒县，俘虏了投降楚国的那两位吴国公子。当时阖庐就想一鼓作气乘胜进攻楚国的郢都，而将军孙武说：“士民已经很疲惫了，不能再打，我们应该暂时等一等。”于是吴军回师。
When the king of Chu killed his ministers Xi Wan and Bo Zhouli, the latter's grandson Bo Pi fled to Wu and King Helü made him a minister too. After the two lords sent to attack Chu found retreat impossible and heard that Lord Guang had assassinated King Liao and enthroned himself,they surrendered with their forces to Chu and were given the district of Shu as their fief. Three years after King Helü ascended the throne,he raised an army and with the help of Wu Zixu and Bo Piattacked Chu,took Shu and captured the two renegades.He wanted to advance on Ying,the capi- tal of Chu,but his commander Sun Wu said,“Our men are tired.The time has not yet come.We had better wait."So they returned.

四年,吴伐楚，取六与溉。五年,伐越，败之。六年,楚昭王使公子囊瓦将兵伐吴。吴使伍员迎击，大破楚军于豫章,取楚之居巢。
阖庐四年，吴又兴兵伐楚，占领了六、濡两县。阖庐五年，吴国起兵伐越，击败了越国。阉庐六年，楚昭王派公子囊瓦率军伐吴。吴派伍子胥率军迎击，大败楚军于豫章，又重新占领了楚国的居巢。
In the fourth year the army of Wu attacked Chu again and took Liu and Jian.In the fifth year they attacked and defeated Yue.In the sixth year King Zhao of Chu sent Lord Nang with troops against Wu, but Wu Zixu,who had been dispatched by King Helü to resist,utterly routed him at Yuzhang and captured Juchao from Chu.

九年,吴王阖庐谓子胥、孙武曰：“始子言郢未可入，今果何如?”二子对曰：“楚将囊瓦贪，而唐、蔡皆怨之。王必欲大伐之，必先得唐、蔡乃可。”阖庐听之，悉兴师与唐、蔡伐楚，与楚夹汉水而阵。吴王之弟夫概将兵请从,王不听，遂以其属五千人击楚将子常。子常败走，奔郑。于是吴乘胜而前，五战，遂至郢。己卯,楚昭王出奔。庚辰,吴王入郢。
阖庐九年，吴王阖庐对伍子胥与孙武说：“过去你们总说不能进攻楚国的郢都，现在怎么样?”两个人回答说：“楚国的大将囊瓦生性贪婪，唐国、蔡国都恨他。您如果一定想要伐楚，应该先取得唐国和蔡国的配合。”阖庐同意了，就发动了全国的军队，和唐国、蔡国一起进攻楚国，双方隔着汉水对阵。这时阖庐的弟弟夫概请求率军出击，阔庐不允许，于是夫概便带着自己部下的五千人突然出动，猛攻楚将子常，子常大败，逃到郑国去了。吴王见夫概获胜，便让全军乘胜进击，沿途又经过五场大战，到达了郢都城下。十一月二十八日，楚昭王离城出逃。第二天，吴王进入了郢都。
In the ninth year of his reign King Helü said to Wu Zixu and Sun Wu,“Some years ago you told me the time was not ripe to attack the capital of Chu.Is the time now ripe?" "Chu's commander,Lord Nang,is a grasping man,"they replied, "and both Tang and Cai bear him a grudge.If you want to attack in strength,first win over Tang and Cai." The king,acting on their advice,mobilized all his forces and at- tacked Chu with the help of Tang and Cai.They took up battle forma- tion facing the army of Chu across the River Han.The king's younger brother Fugai wanted to join in with his troops,but the king refused. However,Fugai charged with five thousand men and defeated Gen- eral Gongsun Wa of Chu,who fled to Zheng.Then the men of Wu advanced victoriously and after five more battles reached the capital of Chu.King Zhao of Chu fled his capital which the king of Wu entered the next day.King Zhao fled to Yunmeng,but being attacked there by rebels escaped to Yun.

昭王出亡，入云梦;盗击王，王走郧。郧公弟怀曰:“平王杀我父,我杀其子，不亦可乎!”郧公恐其弟杀王,与王奔随。吴兵围随，谓随人曰：“周之子孙在汉川者，楚尽灭之。”随人欲杀王，王子綦匿王,己自为王以当之。随人卜与王于吴，不吉，乃谢吴不与王四。
楚昭王逃出郢都后，进入了云梦泽，后来遭到盗贼的袭击，只好又逃到了他们的附庸郧国。郧公的弟弟斗怀说：“楚平王当初杀了我们的父亲，现在我们杀他的儿子，这不是很合理吗?”郧公怕他的弟弟杀害楚昭王，便亲自陪着昭王逃到了随国。吴军紧跟着也包围了随国，吴国对随人说：“周朝子孙被封在汉水流域的国家，几乎都被楚国灭掉了，你们随国为什么还帮助他们呢?”随人听了就想杀死楚昭王，而楚昭王的哥哥王子綦把楚昭王藏了起来，自己冒称楚昭王，准备替昭王死。后来随人占卜，结果显示把楚王交给吴国不吉利，就回绝了吴国，没有把楚王交出去。
Lord Huai,younger brother of the lord of Yun,said,“King Ping killed my father—should I not kill his son?”For fear lest he do so,the lord of Yun escorted King Zhao to Sui. The forces of Wu besieged Sui and told the defenders,“Chu has wiped out all descendants of the House of Zhou in the Han Valley.” Then the men ofSui would have killed King Zhao had not his son Qi hidden him and taken his place.They consulted an oracle to see whether or not they should hand the king over to Wu,but receiving a negative answer they did not surrender him.

始伍员与申包胥为交，员之亡也，谓包胥曰：“我必覆楚。”包胥曰：“我必存之。”及吴兵入郢，伍子胥求昭王。既不得，乃掘楚平王墓，出其尸，鞭之三百，然后已。申包胥亡于山中，使人谓子胥曰：“子之报仇，其以甚乎!吾闻之，人众者胜天，天定亦能破人。今子故平王之臣，亲北面而事之，今至于缪死人,此岂其无天道之极乎!”伍子胥曰：“为我谢申包胥曰，吾日莫途远，吾故倒行而逆施之。”于是申包胥走秦告急,求救于秦。秦不许。包胥立于秦廷，昼夜哭，七日七夜不绝其声。秦哀公怜之，曰：“楚虽无道，有臣若是，可无存乎!”乃遣车五百乘救楚击吴。六月,败吴兵于稷。会吴王久留楚求昭王，而阖庐弟夫概乃亡归，自立为王。阖庐闻之，乃释楚而归，击其弟夫概。夫概败走，遂奔楚。楚昭王见吴有内乱，乃复入郢。封夫概于堂器，为堂豁氏。楚复与吴战，败吴，吴王乃归。
起初伍子胥和申包胥两人是朋友，当伍子胥被害逃离楚国时，对申包胥说：“我将来一定要灭掉楚国。”申包胥说：“那我一定要保住这个国家。”后来吴军攻入郢都，伍子胥就到处搜捕楚昭王，但没有找到，于是他掘开了楚平王的墓，把楚平王的尸体拉出来抽了三百鞭子，才算完事。这时申包胥逃到了荒山之中，他派人去对伍子胥说；“你的这种报仇也太过分啦!人们常说，人有时可以胜天，但是天终究还是要胜人。你原先也是楚平王的臣子，曾在他驾前做过事，可是今天你竟至于鞭打他的尸体，这不是违背天道到极点了吗?”伍子胥对来人说：“你回去替我告诉申包胥，我是一个日暮途远的人，因此我也只能倒行逆施了。”于是申包胥就跑到了秦国告急，请求秦国出兵拯救楚国。秦国开始不答应。申包胥就站在秦宫殿前的院子里，日夜嚎哭，七天七夜没住声。秦哀公听着觉得可怜，说：“楚王虽然残暴无道，但是能有这样忠心的臣子，这样的国家难道不该得到拯救吗?”于是派出了兵车五百辆攻吴救楚。六月，大破吴军于稷丘。这时正好由于吴王长时间地留在楚国搜捕楚昭王，而吴王的弟弟夫概偷偷地回到吴国，自立为王了。阖庐听到国内有变，赶紧扔下楚国率兵回吴去打他的弟弟夫概。结果夫概失败，逃到了楚国。楚昭王见吴国发生内乱，于是回到了郢都。他接受了夫概的投降，把夫概封在了堂豁，称他的家族为堂豁氏。接着楚国又出兵与吴军交战，吴军又被打败，吴王从此也只好死了灭楚的心，收兵回吴去了。
Wu Zixu had been a friend of Shen Baoxu and when he fled from Chu had told him,"I mean to overthrow Chu." Shen had replied,“Then I mean to preserve it.” When the army of Wu entered the capital,Wu Zixu searched in vain for the king.Then he dug up King Ping's grave,exhumed the corpse and gave it three hundred lashes.Shen fled into the mountains but sent back a message saying,“Are you not overdoing your revenge? I have heard that when they are many,men can overcome Heaven,but that Heaven can break men too.You were King Ping's subject,serving him as your lord,yet now you go so far as to defile the dead.Surely this is utterly counter to the laws of Heaven?” Wu Zixu told the messenger,"Take this answer to Shen.Because time is short and I still have far to go,I am forced to act counter to propriety." Shen Baoxu fled to Qin to ask for help.When he was refused,he stood in the court of Qin and wept without ceasing for seven days and seven nights till Duke Ai of Qin took pity on him,saying,“Although the king of Chu did wrong,since they have such a minister we cannot let the state perish.”He sent five hundred chariots to aid Chu against Wu,and in the sixth month they defeated Wu atJi. King Helü stayed so long in Chu searching for the King that his brother Fugai went back and usurped the throne.When Helü knew this,he decided to leave Chu.He returned to attack Fugai,who fled to Chu in defeat.King Zhao,seeing that Wu was torn by internal strife, went back to his capital and gave Fugai the district of Tangxi as his fief. Thus Fugai became lord of Tangxi.Chu inflicted another defeat upon Wu,whereupon King Helü withdrew.

后二岁,阖庐使太子夫差将兵伐楚，取番。楚惧吴复大来，乃去郢，徙于都。当是时，吴以伍子胥、孙武之谋，西破强楚，北威齐晋，南服越人。
过了两年，阖庐又派太子夫差率军伐楚，占领了鄱阳。而楚国也害怕吴军再次大举进攻，于是把国都从郢向北迁到了都。这个时候，吴国靠着伍子胥、孙武等人，向西打败了强大的楚国，向北威震着齐国和晋国，向南收服了越国。
Two years later the king sent his son Fucha with an army against Chu and he took Fan.Afraid that Wu might strike again with a great force,the king of Chu abandoned his capital,Ying,and moved his court to Ruo. So now,thanks to the stratagems of Wu Zixu and Sun Wu,Wu had defeated powerful Chu in the west,awed Qi and Jin in the north and subdued Yue in the south.

其后四年,孔子相鲁。
在此以后的第四年，孔子做了鲁国的宰相。
Four years later Confucius became prime minister of Lu.

后五年，伐越。越王句践迎击，败吴于携李,伤阖庐指,军却。阖庐病创将死,谓太子夫差曰:“尔忘句践杀尔父乎?”夫差对曰：“不敢忘。”是夕，阖庐死。夫差既立为王，以伯豁为太宰,习战射。二年后伐越,败越于夫湫。越王句践乃以余兵五千人栖于会稽之上四，使大夫种厚币遗吴太宰豁以请和,求委国为臣妾。吴王将许之。伍子胥谏曰：“越王为人能辛苦。今王不灭，后必悔之。”吴王不听，用太宰豁计，与越平。
吴入郢后第五年，吴国起兵伐越。越王句践出兵迎击，在携李大破吴军，阖庐的大脚趾受伤，吴军退却。阖庐的伤势发作，临死前对太子夫差说：“你会忘掉句践杀了你父亲吗?”夫差说：“我至死也不会忘记。”当天夜里阖庐就死去了。夫差即位后，任命伯語为太宰，并开始加紧训练军队。两年后起兵伐越，大破越军于夫湫。越王句践带着他的残兵五千人逃到了会稽山上，他派大夫文种送厚礼给吴国的太宰伯話,通过他向吴王夫差求和，说句践愿把国家交给吴王管辖，连自己夫妻二人也情愿给吴王做奴做婢。吴王心软想答应。伍子胥劝道：“句践能忍受辛苦发愤图强，现在不消灭他，日后一定要后悔的。”但吴王不听伍子胥的劝阻，最后还是采纳了伯話的主张与越国讲和了。
Five years later King Helü attacked Yue.King Goujian of Yue resisted and de- feated the army of Wu at Gusu,wounding King Helu in the hand.The Wu forces retreated.King Helü's wound made him mortally ill,and as he lay dying he asked his son Fucha,"Will you forget that Goujian has killed your father?”"I shall never forget!"swore Fucha. That night King Helü died and Fucha became king.He made Bo Pihis chief minister and practised archery and other military arts.Two years later he attacked Yue and defeated its army at Fujiao.King Goujian withdrew to Mount Kuaiji with the five thousand men remaining to him and sent his minister Zhong with rich presents to Bo Pi to sue for peace,promising to be Wu's vassal.The king of Wu was willing,but Wu Zixu advised against it. "The king of Yue knows how to bide his time,"he said.“If you do not destroy him now,you will live to regret it.”King Fucha disre- garded him,however,and on Bo Pi's advice made peace with Yue.

其后五年,而吴王闻齐景公死而大臣争宠,新君弱,乃兴师北伐齐。伍子胥谏曰：“句践食不重味,吊死问疾，且欲有所用之也。此人不死，必为吴患。今吴之有越，犹人之有腹心疾也。而王不先越而乃务齐，不亦谬乎!”吴王不听，伐齐，大败齐师于艾陵,遂威邹鲁之君以归。益疏子胥之谋。
又过了五年，吴王听说齐景公死了，齐国的大臣正争权夺势，新即位的国君软弱，无法驾驭他们，于是趁势兴兵北伐。伍子胥又劝道：“句践现在饭桌上不摆两个菜，经常去吊问死者，抚恤伤残，可以看出他是为了取得国人的信任，日后要使用他们。这个人只要不死，日后肯定要成为吴国的大患。越国对于吴国来说，是心腹之中的大病。您不首先解决越国而去攻伐齐国，这不是很荒谬吗?”吴王不听，出兵伐齐，大败齐军于艾陵，同时使邹、鲁两国受到极大的威胁。这一来吴王对伍子胥的话就更不听了。
Five years later King Fucha heard that Duke Jing of Qi had died and that the new king was weak,with his ministers contending for power.He raised an army to march north and attack Qi. Wu Zixu advised against this expedition,saying,"King Goujian eats only one dish at each meal.He mourns his dead subjects and shows concern for the sick.This means that he intends to use his men for some purpose.So long as he lives,he is a menace to us.Today Yue is like a cancer in our stomach.It is wrong to attack Qi before destroying Yue." The king paid no attention but attacked Qi,inflicting a great defeat on its army at Ailing and striking awe into the hearts of the kings of Zou and Lu.After that he paid even less attention to Wu Zixu's advice.

其后四年,吴王将北伐齐，越王句践用子贡之谋，乃率其众以助吴,而重宝以献遗太宰豁。太宰豁既数受越赂，其爱信越殊甚，日夜为言于吴王。吴王信用豁之计。伍子胥谏曰：“夫越，腹心之病，今信其浮辞诈伪而贪齐。破齐，譬犹石田,无所用之。且《盘庚之诰》曰:‘有颠越不恭，劓殄灭之，俾无遗育，无使易种于兹邑。’此商之所以兴。愿王释齐而先越；若不然，后将悔之无及。”而吴王不听，使子胥于齐。子胥临行，谓其子曰：“吾数谏王，王不用，吾今见吴之亡矣。汝与吴俱亡，无益也。”乃属其子于齐鲍牧,而还报吴。
又过了四年，吴王又要北伐齐国，这时越王句践听从子贡的计谋，自动地率领军队帮助吴国，同时还献给了伯豁许多宝物。而伯豁已经多次地接受越国的贿赂了，他对于越国分外信任，于是就日夜不停地在吴王面前说越国的好话。吴王对这些全都信以为真。伍子胥对吴王说：“越国是我们真正的心腹之患，可是我们却相信他们的花言巧语而醉心于北伐齐国。即使我们占有了齐国，那也只如得到一片石头地，什么东西也不会长的。《盘庚》里曾说：‘凡是横行无法不服管教的，就要彻底消灭他们，不要让他们留下根子，不能让他们再滋长起来。’商朝所以兴旺，就因为他们有果断的措施。希望大王能够放弃齐国先消灭越国，否则我们将后悔不及。”吴王还是不听，并且打发伍子胥去齐国出使。伍子胥临回国时，对他的儿子说：“我几次劝说吴王，吴王都不听，我看吴国很快就要灭亡了。你留在这里跟着吴国一起灭亡，是没有意义的。”于是，就把他的儿子带到了齐国，把他嘱托给了齐国的鲍牧，而后单独一人回来了。
Four years later King Fucha decided to strike at Qi again.King Goujian of Yue,adopting Zigong's plan,sent troops to help Wu and presented rich gifts to the chief minister Bo Pi who,because he had received many bribes from Yue,liked and trusted Goujian and constantly spoke well of him to the king.And the king was influenced by him. Once more Wu Zixu warned,"Yue is a cancer in our stomach, yet now trusting their empty,deceitful promises you mean to invade Qi.Even if you conquer Qi,it will be as useless to us as a stony field. The Admonition of Pangeng says,An unruly and insolent people should be wiped out,leaving no remnants,no seeds of trouble sown in the land.'This was how the Shang Dynasty prospered.I entreat you to give up Qi and deal first with Yue,before it is too late for anything but regret." The king,instead of listening to him,sent him on a mission to Qi. Just before he left,he told his son,"The king has turned a deaf ear to all my warnings.I can see that Wu will fall,but there is no need for you to fall with Wu."He entrusted his son to Bao Mu of Qi,after which he returned alone to Wu to report on his mission.

吴太宰豁既与子胥有隙，因谗曰：“子胥为人刚暴，少恩，猜贼，其怨望恐为深祸也。前日王欲伐齐，子胥以为不可，王卒伐之而有大功。子胥耻其计谋不用，乃反怨望。而今王又复伐齐，子胥专愎强谏，沮毁用事，徒幸吴之败以自胜其计谋耳。今王自行，悉国中武力以伐齐，而子胥谏不用，因辍谢，详病不行。王不可不备，此起祸不难。且豁使人微伺之，其使于齐也，乃属其子于齐之鲍氏。夫为人臣，内不得意，外倚诸侯，自以为先王之谋臣，今不见用，常鞅鞅怨望。愿王早图之。”
太宰伯豁与伍子胥的矛盾已经是越来越深了，于是就在吴王面前说：“伍子胥生性刚暴，狠毒残忍，他长期以来怨恨大王，我们必须提防他造反作乱。前次大王伐齐，他就说不行，结果大王获得了全胜。但伍子胥并不因此认错，而是相反地更恨大王不听他的话了。如今大王又要伐齐，伍子胥又硬是拦阻，诋毁破坏，希望吴国打败仗以证实他有先见之明。现在大王统率着全国的兵力亲自出征齐国，伍子胥就因为您没听他的话，就故意装病推辞不去。大王不能不防备他，看来恐怕他很快就要造反了。另外我还派人暗中盯过他的梢，他在出使齐国的时候，已经把他的儿子托付给了齐国的鲍氏。作为一个臣子，在国内稍微有点不痛快，就去勾结国外的诸侯，自己仗恃着是先王的老臣，因为今天一时的不被信用，就心怀不满。对于这样的人希望大王早作处置。”
Since Bo Pi bore Wu Zixu a grudge he slandered him to the king, saying,"Wu Zixu is stubborn,hot-tempered,heartless and suspicious. His resentment may lead to serious trouble.When you decided to attack Qi he was against.it,and when your expedition was so successful he felt humiliated at having his advice passed over and became an embittered man.Now that you are going to attack Qi again,Wu Zixu is so set against it that he is undermining our efforts in the hope that we will fail,and thus prove him right.You are going to lead the campaign in person with all the armed forces of the state,yet Wu Zixu,because his advice was disregarded,has excused himself from going on the pretext of illness.Be very vigilant,sir!He could easily start a rebellion.Besides,I have sent men to watch his movements.When he went on that mission to Qi,he entrusted his son to a family there named Bao.He is your subject,yet in his dissatisfaction he has found a protector elsewhere.He is always complaining that he was your father's adviser but is now no longer trusted.I hope you will take steps against him in good time.”

吴王曰：“微子之言，吾亦疑之。” 乃使使赐伍子胥属镂之剑，曰：“子以此死。”
吴王夫差说：“即使你不说这些话，我自己也早就怀疑他了。” 于是就派人给伍子胥送去一把名叫 “属镂” 的宝剑，说：“你就用这把剑来自杀吧。”
The king said,"I had my suspicions before you spoke."He sent a messenger to give Wu Zixu his sword Shulou with the order,"You may kill yourself with this.”

伍子胥仰天叹曰：“嗟乎！谗臣豁为乱矣，王乃反诛我。我令若父霸。自若未立时，诸公子争立，我以死争之于先王，几不得立。若既得立，欲分吴国予我，我顾不敢望也。然今若听谀臣言以杀长者。”
白话文：伍子胥接过剑仰天长叹说：“唉！本来是奸臣伯部误国作乱，可是大王却反而杀我。我曾经辅助你的父亲在诸侯中称霸，在你还没有即位的时候，许多弟兄都争夺过这个王位，是我在先王面前誓死保你，才让你勉强继承王位。你当了吴王之后，想把吴国分一半给我，我都没有要。没想到今天你听信小人的坏话，反而来杀我。”
Wu Zixu cast up his eyes to heaven and sighed.“Ah,that slanderer Bo Pi is plotting treason,but you,my king,are punishing me instead!I made your father a mighty conqueror.Before you came to the throne many princes were contending for it,and had I not fought for you with the last king you would never have been enthroned.After you became king you offered me half your kingdom,but I declined.Now, taken in by the words of a flatterer,you are killing your senior statesman.”

乃告其舍人曰：“必树吾墓上以梓，令可以为器；而抉吾眼悬吴东门之上，以观越寇之入灭吴也。” 乃自刭死。
于是回头告诉他手下的人们说：“你们要在我的墓前种几棵梓树，让它长大了可以作棺材，还要把我的眼珠挖下来挂在吴国国都的东门，我要看着有朝一日越国人从这里进来灭掉吴国。” 说完就自刎而死了。
He instructed his steward,"Plant catalpas over my grave to provide a coffin for the king in time to come.Pluck out my eyes and hang them over the East Gate to see when the Yue invaders break through and destroy our state.”With that he cut his throat.

吴王闻之大怒，乃取子胥尸盛以鸱夷革，浮之江中。吴人怜之，为立祠于江上，因命曰胥山。
吴王听到了伍子胥死前的这番话非常生气，他叫人把伍子胥的尸体装进了一条皮口袋，把它扔进了江里。吴国人对伍子胥十分同情，便在江边为他立了一座庙，并把附近的一座小山称为胥山。
These words so enraged the king that he had Wu Zixu's corpse stuffed in a leather sack and thrown into the river.The men of Wu, grieving over Wu Zixu,built a temple to him by the river and renamed the hill there Mount Zixu.

吴王既诛伍子胥，遂伐齐。齐鲍氏杀其君悼公而立阳生。吴王欲讨其贼，不胜而去。其后二年,吴王召鲁卫之君会之橐皋。其明年,因北大会诸侯于黄池,以令周室。越王句践袭杀吴太子，破吴兵。吴王闻之，乃归，使使厚币与越平。后九年,越王句践遂灭吴，杀王夫差,而诛太宰豁，以不忠于其君，而外受重赂，与己比周也。
吴王杀掉了伍子胥之后便北上伐齐。这时正好齐国的鲍氏杀了齐悼公而另立了公子阳生为君。吴国想抱打不平地讨伐鲍氏，结果没能取胜，只好退兵了。又过了两年，吴国召集鲁国、卫国的国君在橐皋会盟。第二年，吴王又率兵北上，大会各国诸侯于黄池，并借以要挟周王室。不料想越王句践这时乘虚带兵袭击吴国，杀死了吴国的太子，打败吴国的军队。吴王夫差闻讯后，只好由黄池赶回，并派人带着厚礼去与越国求和了。又过了九年，越王句践终于灭掉了吴国，杀死了吴王夫差，同时也杀掉了吴国的太宰伯豁，因为他不忠于自己的国君，接受外人的贿赂，与敌国狼狈为奸。
After killing Wu Zixu, King Fucha set out on his expedition against Qi. The Bao clan of Qi killed Duke Dao and set up Yangsheng in his place, but King Fucha failed to crush their rebellion and withdrew. Two years later he summoned the princes of Lu and Wei (1024B.C.-209B.C.) to a conference at Tuogao. The following year he went north and held a great conference with the heads of all the states at Huangchi, posing as the protector of Zhou. Then King Goujian of Yue launched a sudden attack, killed the crown prince of Wu and routed Wu's army. When King Fucha heard this he went back, sending envoys with rich gifts to sue for peace. Nine years later King Goujian destroyed Wu and killed King Fucha. He also put to death the chief minister Bo Pi because he had been disloyal to his sovereign, collaborated with another state and considered only his own selfish interests.

伍子胥初所与俱亡故楚太子建之子胜者，在于吴。吴王夫差之时，楚惠王欲召胜归楚。叶公谏曰:“胜好勇而阴求死士,殆有私乎!”惠王不听。遂召胜，使居楚之边邑鄢,号为白公。白公归楚三年而吴诛子胥。
当初和伍子胥一起逃出来的原楚国太子建的儿子胜，也一直住在吴国。当吴王夫差在位时，楚王曾想叫他回去。但叶公劝谏说：“胜这个人勇敢好斗，而且还暗中收养了许多亡命之徒，他别是有什么阴谋吧!"楚惠王不听，终于还是把他叫回来了，让他住在楚的边城鄢邑，号为白公。白公归楚的第三年，吴王杀了伍子胥。
Wu Zixu, at his first coming to Wu, had been accompanied by Sheng, son of Crown Prince Jian, who had also fled from Chu. During the reign of Fucha of Wu, King Hui of Chu wanted to recall Sheng, but the lord of Ye advised against it, saying, "Sheng sets store by military prowess and is quietly assembling men ready to die for him. He may be plotting something.” King Hui did not listen to this warning but summoned Sheng back and installed him in the frontier district of Yan with the title lord of Bai. Three years after Sheng's return to Chu, Wu Zixu was killed.

白公胜既归楚，怨郑之杀其父，乃阴养死士求报郑。归楚五年,请伐郑，楚令尹子西许之。兵未发而晋伐郑，郑请救于楚。楚使子西往救，与盟而还。白公胜怒曰：“非郑之仇，乃子西也。”胜自砺剑,人问曰：“何以为?”胜曰：“欲以杀子西。”子西闻之，笑曰：“胜如卵耳，何能为也。”
白公胜归楚以后，怨恨郑国杀了他的父亲太子建，于是就开始豢养敢死队寻机报仇。白公胜回国后的第五年，他请求国家出兵伐郑，楚国的令尹子西答应了他的请求。谁知楚军还没派出而晋国已经出兵伐郑了，郑国派人向楚国求救。楚王派子西前去救郑，子西去后与郑国结盟而回。白公胜见此情景心中大怒，说：“如今我的仇人已经不是郑国，而是子西了。”于是他就自己霍霍磨剑，有人问他：“你磨剑干什么?”白公胜说：“杀子西。”子西听了笑着说：“白公胜像个鸡蛋，一碰就破，他能干什么。”
After the lord of Bai returned to Chu, he nursed a grievance against the state of Zheng for killing his father, and secretly kept armed men to seek revenge. Five years later he asked permission to attack Zheng and the chief minister Zixi agreed. But before the expedition set out, Zheng was invaded by Jin and begged Chu for aid. Then Chu sent Zixi to the rescue, and he returned after making a pact with Zheng. The lord of Bai was angry and declared, "It seems Zixi is my enemy, not Zheng!" He whetted his sword and, when asked the reason, replied, "This is to kill Zixi!" When Zixi heard this he said with a laugh, "That egg-shell Sheng, what can he do to me?”

其后四岁,白公胜与石乞袭杀楚令尹子西、司马子綦于朝。石乞曰：“不杀王，不可。”乃劫王如高府。石乞从者屈固负楚惠王亡走昭夫人之宫。叶公闻白公为乱，率其国人攻白公。白公之徒败，亡走山中,自杀。而虏石乞，而问白公尸处，不言将亨图。石乞曰：“事成为卿，不成而亨，固其职也。”终不肯告其尸处。遂亨石乞，而求惠王，复立之。
四年后的一天，白公胜和石乞乘着上朝的机会发动突然袭击，一举杀死了楚国的令尹子西与司马子綦。石乞对白公胜说：“不把楚王一起杀掉，恐怕不行。”于是就劫持着楚惠王一起向高府转移。不想石乞的随从屈固，偷偷地背着楚惠王逃到惠王的母亲昭王夫人的宫中去了。外面的叶公听说白公在朝内发动了叛乱，便率领着他的属下讨伐白公，白公被打败，逃到山中自杀了。石乞被叶公俘虏，叶公问石乞白公的尸体现在何处，如果不说，就把他烹了。石乞说：“事成了当卿，事败了受烹，本来就理当如此。”到末了他也没有说出白公的尸首在什么地方。于是叶公下令烹了石乞，而后又找出了楚惠王让他恢复了王位。
Four years later the lord of Bai and his follower Shi Qi fell on the Chu chief minister Zixi and the war minister Ziqi and killed them. Then Shi Qi said, “We must kill the king as well.” They pursued the king, who fled to the Gao Mansion. One of Shi Qi's retainers, Qu Gu, carried the king on his back to the queen mother's palace. When the lord of Ye heard that the lord of Bai had rebelled, he led his men to attack him. With the defeat of his followers, the lord of Bai fled into the mountains and killed himself. Shi Qi was captured and threatened with death in the cauldron if he refused to disclose where his master's corpse lay. "Had we succeeded," replied Shi Qi, "I should have been a high minister. Now that we have failed, it is my duty to die in the cauldron.” He refused to say where his lord had died and so he was boiled alive.Then they found King Hui and restored him to the throne.

太史公曰：怨毒之于人甚矣哉!王者尚不能行之于臣下，况同列乎!向令伍子胥从奢俱死，何异蝼蚁。弃小义，雪大耻，名垂于后世。悲夫!方子胥窘于江上，道乞食，志岂尝须臾忘郢邪?故隐忍就功名,非烈丈夫孰能致此哉?白公如不自立为君者,其功谋亦不可胜道者哉!
太史公说：像费无忌那样狠毒地设计害人也做得太过分了!做君主的都不能这样对待臣下，何况同僚呢?至于伍子胥如果当初跟着他的父亲一块死了，那跟死一只蝼蚁没有什么区别。而伍子胥能够不顾眼前的小义，终于报了大仇，又扬名于后世，这是多么悲壮啊!当伍子胥在江上受困，在路边乞食的时候，他何尝有一分一秒忘掉灭楚报仇呢?所以他忍辱发愤终于功成名就，要不是一个坚强刚烈的大丈夫哪能做出这番事业呢?白公如果不图谋自立为王，他的功业恐怕也是称道不完的。
The Grand Historian comments:How deeply resentment rankles in men's hearts!A ruler cannot afford to offend his subjects,much less one of his peers.Had Wu Zixu died with his father,he would have had no more significance than an ant.But setting aside minor scruples to wipe out a great wrong,he made a name that has come down to later ages.Alas for him!Whether hard pressed by the river or begging for food by the roadside,he never for a moment forgot the Chu capital. He endured disgrace to achieve great deeds and fame,and none but a true hero could have done this.If the lord of Bai had not aspired to the throne,his practical achievements and good advice would also have been remarkable.
