越王句践,其先禹之苗裔，而夏后帝少康之庶子也。封于会稽,以奉守禹之祀。文身断发,披草莱而邑焉。后二十余世，至于允常。允常之时，与吴王阖庐战而相怨伐。允常卒，子句践立，是为越王。
越王句践，他的先祖是夏禹的后代，是夏朝的帝王少康的妃妾所生的儿子。被封在会稽，要他在那里祭祀和守护夏禹的坟墓。于是他就入乡随俗地在身上刺上花纹，剪断了长发，在那里开荒种地兴建城堡居住下来了。一直传了二十多代，传到了允常，开始和吴王闺庐作战结下了怨仇互相攻伐。允常死后，他的儿子句践继立当了越王。
Goujian,king of Yue,traced his ancestry back to Yu the Great through descendants of King Shaokang of the Xia Dynasty who were enfeoffed at Kuaiji,where they kept up the sacrifices to Yu.They tat- tooed themselves,cut their hair short,and lived among brambles and weeds.After more than twenty generations there was Yunchang,whose fight with King Helü of Wu resulted in a feud.When Yunchang died, his son Goujian succeeded him as king of Yue.

元年,吴王阖庐闻允常死，乃兴师伐越。越王句践使死士挑战，三行，至吴陈，呼而自刭。吴师观之，越因袭击吴师，吴师败于携李,射伤吴王阖庐。阖庐且死，告其子夫差曰：“必毋忘越。”
句践元年，吴王阖庐得知允常去世的消息，于是趁机兴兵伐越。越王句践组织了一支敢死队去挑战，让他们排成三行一直走到吴军的阵前，而后大呼一声一齐自刎了。吴国军队被这种异常奇特的行动惊呆了，而越军则乘着吴军愣神的工夫突然发起了猛攻，结果吴军在携李遭到惨败，吴王闺庐也被射伤了。闺庐临死前，告诫他的儿子夫差说：“一定不要忘了向越国报仇!"
In the first year of King Goujian,1 King Helu,hearing of Yunchang's death,raised an army to attack Yue.Goujian made his desperadoes challenge the enemy.In three parties they went to the Wu lines and with a great shout cut off their own heads.While the men of Wu were watching this Yue launched a surprise attack at Zuili,defeated Wu and wounded Helü with an arrow.As he lay dying the king ordered his son .Fucha,"Never forget Yue!"

三年，句践闻吴王夫差日夜勒兵,且以报越，越欲先吴未发往伐之。范蠡谏曰:“不可。臣闻兵者凶器也，战者逆德也，争者事之末也。阴谋逆德，好用凶器，试身于所末,上帝禁之，行者不利。”越王曰：“吾已决之矣。”遂兴师。吴王闻之，悉发精兵击越，败之夫椒。越王乃以余兵五千人保栖于会稽。吴王追而围之。
句践三年，他得知吴王夫差日夜练兵、准备复仇的消息，就想抢在吴国没有动手之前主动出击。范蠡劝阻说：“不能轻举妄动。俗话说战争是一种不吉祥的东西，发动战争是违背人道的，到战场上去争胜负也是解决矛盾的最下策，暗中策划违反人道的行动，喜好动用杀人凶器，不顾后果地采取最下策，这些都是上天所绝对禁止的，谁做这种事情谁就会失败。”句践说：“我已经下定决心了。”于是就出了兵。吴王听到消息后，调集了全国的精锐部队迎击越军，在夫椒一战把越军打得大败。句践领着残兵五千人退到了会稽山上，吴王夫差派兵把会稽山团团围住。
Three years later Goujian heard that King Fucha ofWu was train- ing troops day and night to avenge himself.He thought of attacking before Wu's troops set out,but Fan Li advised against this,saying, "Think again.I have heard that arms are unlucky,war an evil force,and that disputes are minor affairs.If you plot with an evil force,by un- lucky means,risking your life over a minor affair,you will be flouting Heaven's will and your campaign will not prosper." "My mind is made up,"said the king,and he raised an army. When the king of Wu knew this,he sent picked troops against Yue and won the battle of Fujiao.Then with the five thousand men left to him,the king of Yue withdrew to Kuaiji,where he was pursued and besieged by the king of Wu.

越王谓范蠡曰：“以不听子故至于此，为之奈何?”蠡对曰：“持满者与天，定倾者与人，节事者以地。卑辞厚礼以遗之，不许，而身与之市。”句践曰：“诺。”乃令大夫种行成于吴,膝行顿首曰：“君王亡臣句践使陪臣种敢告下执事:句践请为臣，妻为妾。”吴王将许之。子胥言于吴王曰:“天以越赐吴，勿许也。”种还，以报句践。句践欲杀妻子，燔宝器，触战以死。种止句践曰：“夫吴太宰部贪,可诱以利，请间行言之。”于是句践乃以美女宝器令种间献吴太宰豁。豁受，乃见大夫种于吴王。种顿首言曰：“愿大王赦句践之罪，尽入其宝器。不幸不赦,句践将尽杀其妻子，燔其宝器，悉五千人触战，必有当也。”豁因说吴王曰：“越以服为臣，若将赦之，此国之利也。”吴王将许之。子胥进谏曰：“今不灭越，后必悔之。句践贤君，种、蠡良臣，若反国，将为乱。”吴王弗听，卒赦越，罢兵而归。
越王对范蠡说：“当初由于没听你的劝告，所以落到这种处境，今天可怎么办呢?”范蠡说：“要想保持国家的全盛不衰必须效法天道的不自满，要想扭转国家的危局必须效法做人的谦卑退让，要想节约致富必须效法垦植的因地制宜。我们目前只能用谦恭的话语和丰厚的礼品去向人家求饶，如果他还不答应，那就只有用我们自己的人身去和他周旋，去给他当奴隶。”句践说：“好。”于是就派了大夫文种去向吴国求和。文种到吴国后跪行到吴王跟前，叩头说：“您的败军之臣句践派他的仆从文种来向您禀告：句践现在情愿做您的奴隶，他的妻子情愿做您的婢女。”吴王见说得这等可怜就要答应他们的请求。伍子胥劝阻吴王说：“现在是老天爷把越国给了我们，我们不能允许它存留。”文种失望地回到会稽，把经过报告了句践。句践愤怒地准备杀死妻儿，烧毁珍宝，和吴国决一死战。文种劝阻句践说：“吴国的太宰伯磊很贪婪，我们可以想办法收买他，请让我悄悄地去和他交涉。”于是句践就让文种把美女宝物偷偷地给伯豁送了去。伯磊接受了并很快地领着文种去见了吴王。文种叩头对吴王求情说：“希望大王宽赦句践的罪过，如果能这样，句践将向您献出越国的全部财宝；如果您不宽赦，那么句践将杀掉妻儿，烧毁宝器，率领五千人和您决一死战，那时您肯定要付出相应代价的。”这时伯磊从旁接话劝吴王说：“句践既然已经愿意降服给我们当臣民，看来还是饶恕他，对我们的国家有利。”吴王见此情景，就想答应越国的请求。伍子胥又进前劝阻说：“今天如果不把越国灭掉，将来肯定是要后悔的。句践是一个有才干的国君，文种、范蠡也都是有才干的大臣，如果一朝放他们回了国，必将成为我们的大祸害。”吴王不听，终于宽赦了越国，撤回了包围会稽的军队。
Goujian told Fan Li,"This comes of not following your advice. What shall I do now?” Fan Li replied,“One who overcomes self-satisfaction gains the help of heaven,one who can turn a disastrous situation into a secure one gains the help of men,and one who practises frugality gains the help of the earth.Try to placate him with humble words and rich gifts And if that fails,offer yourself as a hostage." Goujian,approving,sent his minister Wen Zhong to sue for peace. Approaching on his knees,Wen Zhong kowtowed to the king of Wu, saying,"Your worthless subject Goujian sends his slave with the re- quest that he may be your subject and his wife your serving-maid.”The king was about to agree when Wu Zixu said,"Heaven has delivered Yue into our hands.Don't accept." When Wen Zhong reported this on his return,Goujian wanted to kill his wife and children,destroy his bronze vessels and jewels,and die fighting.But Wen Zhong stopped him,suggesting,"Bo Pi,the chancel- lor of Wu,is a grasping man who can be bribed.Let me go and talk to him secretly."So Goujian sent him with beautiful girls and jewels to the chancellor.Bo Piaccepted these and got Wen Zhong another audience with the king of Wu. Wen Zhong kowtowed and said,"I entreat Your Majesty to par- don Goujian and take all his bronze vessels!Unless you have mercy,he will kill his wife and children,destroy his jewels and fight to the last with his five thousand men,who can still do some damage." Bo Pialso advised the king,saying,"Goujian of Yue has surren- dered as your slave.If you pardon him,this will benefit our state.” Again the king of Wu was about to agree when Wu Zixu advanced to warn him,"If you do not destroy Yue now,you will live to regret it. Goujian is an able ruler,while Wen Zhong and FanLiare good ministers. If you let them return to Yue they will make trouble for Wu."But the king,ignoring his advice,pardoned Yue and withdrew his troops.

句践之困会稽也，喟然叹曰：“吾终于此乎?”种曰：“汤系夏台,文王囚羑里,晋重耳奔翟,齐小白奔莒,其卒王霸。由是观之，何遽不为福乎?”
当句践被困在会稽山的时候，他伤心地叹息说：“难道我就在这里完蛋了吗?”文种说：“商汤曾被关押在夏台，周文王曾被囚禁在羑里，晋公子重耳曾逃奔到狄区，齐公子小白也曾逃难到莒国，但他们后来全都称了王称了霸。由这些人的例子看来，谁能说我们这一次不是一件好事呢?”
While besieged at Kuaiji,Goujian had sighed and asked,"Is this the end?”Wen Zhong told him,“King Tang of Shang was a captive in Xiatai,King Wen of Zhou was imprisoned in Youli,Duke Wen of Jin fled to ·Diand Duke Huan of Qi toJu;but they triumphed in the end.For all we know,this may lead to good fortune."

吴既赦越，越王句践反国,乃苦身焦思，置胆于坐，坐卧即仰胆，饮食亦尝胆也。曰：“女忘会稽之耻邪?”身自耕作，夫人自织，食不加肉，衣不重采,折节下贤人，厚遇宾客，振贫吊死,与百姓同其劳。欲使范蠡治国政，蠡对曰：“兵甲之事，种不如蠡；填抚国家,亲附百姓，蠡不如种。”于是举国政属大夫种，而使范蠡与大夫柘稽行成，为质于吴。二岁而吴归蠡。
等到吴国宽赦了越国，句践回到国都之后，便吃苦耐劳，苦思冥想地准备着报仇雪耻。他把一个苦胆吊在坐席旁，使自己坐着躺着都能看到它，在每次吃饭喝水的时候也都要尝尝它的苦味。他借此提醒自己说：“你忘记在会稽山遭到的凌辱了吗?”他亲身耕地做工，他的夫人也亲自纺纱织布，他们饭桌上没有第二盘肉菜，衣服上没有任何花纹和装饰，他们放下架子尊重贤人，对宾客优礼相待，他们救济贫困，抚恤死伤，跟普通百姓一样从事劳动。句践想把治理国家的大政交给范蠡，范蠡说：“练兵作战的事情，文种不如我；安定国家，镇抚百姓的事情，我不如文种。”于是句践就把国家大政交给了文种，而让范蠡跟大夫柘稽去同吴国谈判，并留在那里当人质。两年后，吴国放心地让范蠡回来了。
After being spared by Wu,Goujian returned to his state to lead a hard life and take anxious thought.He kept gall by his mat,looking at it while seated or lying down and tasting it while eating,to remind himself not to forget the disgrace ofKuaiji.He tilled the fields himself, made his wife spin cloth,went without meat and wore no coloured silks.He treated men of talent respectfully and his protégés handsomely, helping the poor,mourning the dead and sharing his people's toil. Fan Li was asked to govern the state,but he said,"In military matters I am better than Wen Zhong.But in governing a state and uniting the people,I am no match for him."So affairs of state were entrusted to Wen Zhong while Fan Li and another minister,Zhe Ji, went to Wu to sue for peace and remained there as hostages.Two years later,Wu sent Fan Li back.

句践自会稽归七年,拊循其士民，欲用以报吴。大夫逢同谏曰:“国新流亡，今乃复殷给，缮饰备利,吴必惧，惧则难必至。且鸷鸟之击也，必匿其形。今夫吴兵加齐、晋,怨深于楚、越,名高天下，实害周室,德少而功多，必淫自矜。为越计，莫若结齐，亲楚，附晋，以厚吴。吴之志广，必轻战。是我连其权，三国伐之，越承其弊，可克也。”句践曰：“善。”
句践从会稽回国的第七年，对百姓的抚慰工作已经差不多了，就准备征兵对吴国作战。这时大夫逢同劝阻道：“国家遭受破败现在才刚刚富裕一点，如果马上就整军备战，吴国立刻就会警觉起来，吴国一警觉我们就要大祸临头了。一只猛禽在它行将袭击小鸟时，一定要把它的身体隐藏好。现在吴国向北对齐国、晋国用兵，在南方又与楚国、越国结怨，他的威名至高无上，这就又危害到了周天子的权威，一个人的仁德少而武功多，他就必定要骄傲自大。为越国着想，不如同齐国、楚国、晋国搞好关系，故意让吴国显得雄厚、强大。随着吴国野心的不断扩大，他也就必然愈来愈好战。到那时我们就掌握了主动权，当齐、晋、楚联合起来伐吴时，我们就可以趁着它几面受敌而一举消灭它了。”句践说：“太好了。”
Seven years after his return from Kuaiji Goujian had succeeded in winning the support of his people,who were eager to take revenge on Wu.But his minister Feng Tong said,“Our state which was nearly de- stroyed is only just becoming self-supporting,prosperous and pre- pared for war.If we alarm Wu,we will inevitably bring disaster on ourselves.A hawk must keep out of sight before it swoops.The king ofWu is now attacking Qi and Jin,while Chu and our state are his old enemies.So great is his prestige that he constitutes a threat to the House of Zhou.His virtue is slight but his achievement great,and he is ambitious,exulting in his strength.Our best plan,therefore,is to ally with Qi,Chu and Jin and keep on friendly terms with Wu.Since Wu aims at conquest,she will think nothing of fighting;but we shall have three other states as our allies against her,and by joining battle when Wu is exhausted we can defeat her.” "Very well,"agreed Goujian.

居二年,吴王将伐齐。子胥谏曰：“未可。臣闻句践食不重味,与百姓同苦乐。此人不死，必为国患。吴有越，腹心之疾；齐与吴，疥癣也。愿王释齐先越。”吴王弗听，遂伐齐，败之艾陵,虏齐高、国以归。让子胥。子胥曰：“王毋喜!”王怒，子胥欲自杀，王闻而止之。越大夫种曰：“臣观吴王政骄矣，请试尝之贷粟，以卜其事。”请贷，吴王欲与，子胥谏勿与，王遂与之，越乃私喜。子胥言曰：“王不听谏，后三年吴其墟乎!”太宰豁闻之，乃数与子胥争越议,因谗子胥曰：“伍员貌忠而实忍人，其父兄不顾,安能顾王?王前欲伐齐，员强谏，已而有功，用是反怨王。王不备伍员，员必为乱。”与逢同共谋,谗之王。王始不从，乃使子胥于齐，闻其托子于鲍氏，王乃大怒，曰：“伍员果欺寡人!”役反，使人赐子胥属镂剑以自杀。子胥大笑曰：“我令而父霸,我又立若，若初欲分吴国半予我，我不受，已，今若反以谗诛我。嗟乎，嗟乎，一人固不能独立!"报使者曰：“必取吾眼置吴东门，以观越兵人也!”于是吴任豁政。
又过了两年，吴王准备北伐齐国，伍子胥劝阻说：“不行。我听说句践现在吃饭都不吃两样有滋味的菜，一心同百姓们共甘苦。这个人不死，一定会成为吴国的祸患。越国的存在，对吴国是心腹之疾，至于齐国那只不过是疥癣而已。恳请大王放弃齐国，先收拾越国。”吴王不听，起兵攻齐，败齐军于艾陵，虏获了齐国的高昭子和国惠子两个大贵族。回来后，吴王得意地斥责伍子胥。伍子胥说：“大王不要高兴得太早!”吴王很生气，伍子胥想要自杀，吴王听说后制止了他。这时越国的文种对句践说：“我看吴王的办事现在已经相当傲慢了，咱们再用向他借粮的办法来试探一下。"于是越国向吴国借粮食，吴王想要借给他们，伍子胥劝说不要给，吴王还是硬自做主给了，越国人心中暗暗高兴。伍子胥底下对人说：“大王总不听我的劝告，恐怕三年之后吴国就要成为一片废墟了!”太宰伯磊听到了伍子胥的埋怨，他过去在对待越国的政策上多次与伍子胥争执不下，这回就在吴王面前挑拨煽动说：“伍子胥貌似忠厚实际上是一个很残忍的人，他连他父兄的生死都不顾哪还会关心大王呢?大王上次伐齐之前，他就竭力反对，后来您伐齐胜利了，他还因此怨恨您。您要是不好好防备他，他一定会造反的。”接着伯話又伙同越国的奸细逢同一起密谋，轮番在吴王面前说伍子胥的坏话。吴王开始还不听，后来他派伍子胥去齐国，听说伍子胥把他的儿子带到齐国去托付给鲍氏照看了，于是才大怒说：“伍子胥果然是在欺骗我!”等伍子胥回来后，吴王就派人给伍子胥送去一把属镂剑让他自杀。伍子胥接过宝剑大笑说：“我曾经辅佐你的父亲成了霸主，又立你当了吴王。想当初你曾经要把吴国的一半分给我，我不要，可是到了今天你却听信小人的诬陷来杀我。嗨!我看你光杆一个将来依靠谁!”他对吴王派来的使者说：“我死后你们要把我的眼睛挖出来放在吴国都城的东门上，让它看着越兵进城吧!”伍子胥死后，吴王把国家的一切大政都交给了伯語。
Two years later the king of Wu decided to make war on Qi.Wu Zixu warned,"Don't do it yet.I have heard that Goujian eats only one dish at each meal and shares the joys and sorrows of his people.So long as this man lives,he is bound to be a threat to our state.Yue is like a cancer in our belly,while Qi is nothing but a disease of the skin.I hope you will leave Qi alone and attack Yue first.” The king paid no attention but attackedand defeated Qiat Ailing, capturing the ministers Gao and Guo. When blamed for giving the wrong advice,Wu Zixu said,"Don't laugh too soon,sir!”The king was angry and Wu Zixu determined to kill himself,but the king,hearing of this,stopped him. Wen Zhong,the minister of Yue,said,"I fancy the king of Wu is over-confident.Let us test him by asking for a loan of grain.”The king of Wu agreed to a loan despite Wu Zixu's protests,to the secret delight of Yue “The king will not listen to good advice,"lamented Wu Zixu."In three years Wu will be in ruins." When Chancellor Bo Piheard this,he disputed with him.They had many arguments and Bo Pislandered him to the king,saying,"He may look loyal but in fact he is quite ruthless.If he cared nothing for his own father and brother,why should he care about his king?When you decided to attack Qihe argued against it.When you were successful he started grumbling again.Unless you take care,he will rebel.” He plotted with Feng Tong to abuse Wu Zixu to the king,who did not believe them at first and sent Wu Zixu as his envoy to Qi.He was enraged,however,to hear that Wu Zixu had entrusted his son to the Bao family there. "So he really is deceiving mel"he exclaimed."He means to rebel." He sent a messenger to Wu Zixu with his sword Shulou and orders to kill himself. Wu Zixu laughed."I made your father a great conqueror and set you on your throne,"he cried."You offered me half your kingdom then,but I would not accept it.Yet now you are putting me to death because of slander.Ah,well!No man can stand alone."He told the messenger,"Pluck out my eyes and set them over the East Gate,so that I can watch the men of Yue march into Wu." After this all affairs of state were entrusted to Bo Pi.

居三年,句践召范蠡曰：“吴已杀子胥，导谀者众,可乎?”对曰：“未可。”
又过了三年，句践问范蠡说：“吴国已经把伍子胥杀了，现今吴王周围大都是一些谄媚讨好的人了，可以出兵打他了吗?”范蠡说：“不行。”
When three more years had passed,Goujian summoned Fan Li to ask,"The king of Wu has killed Wu Zixu and is surrounded by flatter- ers—is this our chance?" The answer was,"Not yet."

至明年春,吴王北会诸侯于黄池,吴国精兵从王，惟独老弱与太子留守。句践复问范蠡，蠡曰“可矣”。乃发习流二千人,教士四万人,君子六千人,诸御千人,伐吴。吴师败，遂杀吴太子。吴告急于王，王方会诸侯于黄池，惧天下闻之，乃秘之”。吴王已盟黄池,乃使人厚礼以请成越。越自度亦未能灭吴，乃与吴平。
又到了第二年春天，吴王北上与诸侯在黄池会盟，吴国的精锐部队都跟随吴王走了，在国内跟着太子留守的只有老弱残兵。这时句践又问范蠡现在的时机如何，范蠡说“可以了”。于是就调集了熟悉水战的两千人，经过专门训练的四万人，有志行享受特殊待遇的六千人，近卫侍从一千人，大举偷袭吴国。结果吴军溃败，吴国太子被杀。当吴国派人到黄池向夫差告急时，夫差正好与诸侯们开会，他怕消息传出会上对吴国不利，于是就秘而不宣。直到盟约签订，夫差才派人带着厚礼去向越国求和。越王估量着暂时也还没有消灭吴国的条件，便答应与吴国讲和了。
The next spring King Fucha,escorted by his best troops,went north to Huangchi for a conference withall the heads of states,leaving only the old and infirm under the crown prince to guard Wu.And now when Goujian questioned Fan Li again,he agreed that the time had come.Yue mobilized two thousand men sentenced to exile,forty thou- sand trained men,six thousand knights and a thousand officers.They attacked Wu,defeated the defenders and killed the crown prince. When this disaster was announced to King Fucha at the conference, he kept it secret from the other states.After an agreement had been reached at Huangchi,he sent envoys with rich gifts to Yue to sue for peace.And since Goujian felt unable to destroy Wu yet,he made peace.

其后四年,越复伐吴。吴士民罢弊,轻锐尽死于齐、晋。而越大破吴，因而留围之三年，吴师败,越遂复栖吴王于姑苏之山。吴王使公孙雄肉袒膝行而前,请成越王曰：“孤臣夫差敢布腹心,异日尝得罪于会稽,夫差不敢逆命,得与君王成以归。今君王举玉趾而诛孤臣,孤臣惟命是听，意者亦欲如会稽之赦孤臣之罪乎?”句践不忍，欲许之。范蠡曰：“会稽之事，天以越赐吴，吴不取。今天以吴赐越，越其可逆天乎?且夫君王蚤朝晏罢,非为吴邪?谋之二十二年,一旦而弃之，可乎?且夫天与弗取，反受其咎。‘伐柯者其则不远’,君忘会稽之厄乎?”句践曰：“吾欲听子言，吾不忍其使者。”范蠡乃鼓进兵，曰：“王已属政于执事,使者去，不者且得罪。”吴使者泣而去。句践怜之，乃使人谓吴王曰：“吾置王甬东，君百家。”吴王谢曰：“吾老矣，不能事君王!”遂自杀。乃蔽其面，曰：“吾无面以见子胥也!”越王乃葬吴王而诛太宰部。
又过了四年，越国又出兵伐吴。这时吴国的军民已经非常疲惫，因为他的精锐部队都在与齐、晋两国的作战中消耗光了，因而越国这回很轻易地把吴军打得大败，而且包围了吴国的首都，一围三年。后来都城又被攻破，吴王夫差逃上了姑苏山。夫差无法只好派公孙雄脱衣露体跪行向前，向句践哀求说：“您无依无靠的外臣夫差斗胆地向您请求，过去我曾经得罪您把您弄到会稽山上去了。后来您一向我提出要求，我二话没说立即就同您讲和，让您回了国。今天劳动您来讨伐我们，我们现在一切都听您的。您是不是也能够像过去我们在会稽山那样，也把我们饶了呢?”句践听着于心不忍，也想答应他的要求。这时范蠡拦阻说：“过去我们被困在会稽，那是老天爷要把越国送给吴国，可是吴国不要。今天老天爷又把吴国送给我们了，我们怎么能违背天命呢?再说大王您每天起早贪黑地奋斗，不就是为了消灭吴国吗?我们花费了二十二年的心血才获得了今天的成功，我们怎能一下子把它扔掉呢?老天爷给你的东西你不要，日后是要倒霉的。《诗经》里曾说‘拿着斧子去砍取一个新的斧子柄，就按照你手里那个旧柄的样子就行’,您难道忘了我们当初在会稽受的罪了吗?”句践说：“你的话是对的，我只是不忍心驳回他们的哀求。”于是范蠡就擂鼓进兵，他高声宣布说：“大王已把事情交给我处理了，吴国使者赶快回去，如果再不走，就休怪我们不客气了。”吴国使者只好流着眼泪离去了。句践觉得太可怜，于是又派人去对吴王说：“我可以把您安置在甬东，让您到那里去当一个百户人家的头领。”吴王谢绝说：“我已经老了，不能再侍候您!”于是就自杀了。死前他用衣服遮上了自己的脸说：“我没有脸面去见伍子胥!”句践安葬完了吴王夫差，跟着就把太宰伯磊也杀掉了。
Four years later Yue attacked Wu again.Because the people of Wu were exhausted and their best troops had fallen in the wars with Qi and Jin,Yue routed their forces and besieged the capital for three years. Then the army of Wu was beaten and the king driven to Mount Gusu.He made Gongsun Xiong his envoy,to advance upon his knees with bared back and beg the king of Yue for peace. "Your subject Fucha presumes to lay bare his heart to you,"said Gongsun Xiong."In days gone by he wronged you at Kuaiji,but com- plied with your request for peace.Now that you have advanced in majesty to mete out punishment,he must obey your commands.Will you pardon his offence,as he pardoned yours at Kuaiji?” Goujian had not the heart to refuse,but Fan Li said,“At Kuaiji, Heaven delivered us into their hands,but they did not seize their chance. Now Heaven has delivered them into our hands:is Yue to oppose the will of Heaven?Did you not hold court for long hours every day on account of Wu?Twenty-two years you have been planning this:how can you throw away your victory now?One who spurns what Heaven offers will suffer for it.As the saying goes,the woodcutter has not far to look for the example of an axehandle.Have you forgotten what trouble you were in on Mount Kuaiji,sir?” "I want to be guided by you,"replied Goujian."But I am sorry for the envoy." Accordingly FanLi sounded drums and ordered troops to advance. Then he announced,"His Majesty has left this in my hands.The envoy must leave or pay the penalty."Then the envoy of Wu left,weeping. Goujian out of pity sent this message to the king of Wu,"I shall settle you east of Yong and make you lord over one hundred families." But the king of Wu declined,saying,"I am too old to serve another King."He covered his face,crying,"How can I face Wu Zi- xu?”And with that he killed himself.Goujian had the king of Wu buried and executed Chancellor Bo Pi.

句践已平吴，乃以兵北渡淮，与齐、晋诸侯会于徐州,致贡于周。周元王使人赐句践胙，命为伯。句践已去,渡淮南，以淮上地与楚,归吴所侵宋地于宋,与鲁泗东方百里。当是时，越兵横行于江、淮东,诸侯毕贺，号称霸王。
句践平定吴国后，接着率军北渡淮河，与齐国、晋国的诸侯会盟于徐州，并给周天子送去了贡品。周元王也派人给句践送来了祭祀的肉，封他作为方伯，也就是诸侯的盟主。句践离开徐州南渡淮河后，就把淮河上游的地盘分给楚国，又把吴国过去侵占的宋国的领土还给了宋国，把泗水以东的纵横百里的地方给了鲁国。这时候，越国的军队在长江、淮河以东强大无敌，各国的诸侯都向他朝贺，句践成了一时的霸主。
After his conquest of Wu he advanced across the River Huai to meet the rulers of Qi and Jin at Xuzhou.He presented tribute to the king of Zhou,who sent an envoy to him with sacrificial meat and gave him the title of Lord Protector.Then Goujian returned south of the River Huai and gave the Huai Valley to Chu,returned the territory of Song which Wu had annexed,and gave a hundred square lieast of the River Si to Lu.The army of Yue was now supreme throughout the eastern Yangtse and Huai River valleys.All the states sent Goujian congratulations,and he called himself the Overlord.

范蠡遂去,自齐遗大夫种书曰:“蜚鸟尽，良弓藏；狡兔死，走狗亨。越王为人长颈鸟喙，可与共患难，不可与共乐。子何不去?”种见书，称病不朝。人或谗种且作乱，越王乃赐种剑曰：“子教寡人伐吴七术,寡人用其三而败吴，其四在子，子为我从先王试之。”种遂自杀。
范蠡离朝远走，他从齐国给大夫文种写了一封信说：“飞鸟一旦捕尽，良弓也就没了用场；狡兔全都死了，猎狗也就要被杀光。越王这个人长脖子鹰钩嘴，只能和他一块吃苦，不能和他一道享福，您怎么还不赶紧离开?”文种见信后，就假托有病不再上朝。这时有人便诬陷文种，说他要造反，于是句践就派人给文种送去一把剑说：“你曾教过我攻伐吴国的七种妙术，结果我只用三种就打败了吴国，还有四种没有用过，你带着它到九泉之下帮我先人们再去试试吧。”逼得文种只好自杀了。
Then Fan Lileft,sending Wen Zhong a letter from Qiin which he said,"When all the birds are killed the good bow is put away.When the cunning hares are dead the hounds are made into stew.The king of Yue with his long neck and predatory mouth is a good companion in time of trouble but not in time of peace.You had better leave.” After receiving this letter,Wen Zhong stayed away from court on the pretext of illness but slanderers accused him of plotting rebellion. Then Goujian sent him a sword with this message,"You told me of seven ways to conquer Wu and by using three of them I have over- thrown it.That leaves you with four—why not try them with my kingly ancestors?”Thereupon Wen Zhong committed suicide.

句践卒，子王師与立。王跖与卒，子王不寿立。王不寿卒，子王翁立。王翁卒，子王翳立。王翳卒，子王之侯立。王之侯卒，子王无彊立。
句践死后，他的儿子師与继位；新与死了，他的儿子不寿继位。不寿死后，他的儿子翁继位。翁死后，他的儿子翳继位。翳死后，他的儿子之侯继位。之侯死后，他的儿子无彊继位。
Goujian died and was succeeded by his son,Shiyu.The throne passed from father to son,from Shiyu to Bushou,Weng,Yi,Zhihou and Wujiang.

王无彊时，越兴师北伐齐，西伐楚，与中国争强。当楚威王之时,越北伐齐，齐威王使人说越王曰:“越不伐楚，大不王，小不伯。图越之所为不伐楚者，为不得晋也。韩、魏固不攻楚。韩之攻楚，覆其军，杀其将,则叶、阳翟危;魏亦覆其军，杀其将，则陈、上蔡不安。故二晋之事越也，不至于覆军杀将，马汗之力不效。所重于得晋者何也?”
无彊在位时，越国出兵北伐齐国，西攻楚国，与中原地区的诸侯们争强斗胜。当时楚国正是楚威王当政。当越国北伐齐国时，齐威王派人对越王说：“如果越国不征服楚国，那就别说不能称王，连个霸主也称不上。我猜想越国之所以不敢攻打楚国，是因为没有得到三晋的支持。但是韩国和魏国是根本不会帮着你们去打楚国的。因为韩国打楚国，一旦失败就不仅是损兵折将，而且他的叶县、阳翟就很危险；魏国一旦失败也不仅是损兵折将，而他的陈县、上蔡也紧跟着告急。因此这两个国家即使能同越国友好也只是为了求得他自己的不致损兵折将而已，他们不会给您尽一点汗马之劳。您为什么那么看重三晋呢?”
During the reign of Wujiang,Yue attacked Qi in the north and Chu in the west,contending for power with the central states.In the time of King Wei of Chu,Yue struck north against Qi and King Wei of Qi sent an envoy to advise the king of Yue,"Unless you attack Chu,you cannot be a king or a conqueror.I assume you have not yet done so because you lack the support of Han(403B.C.-230B. C.)and Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.),who will not attack Chu.If Han de- feated an army of Chu and killed its commander,the Han cities of Ye and Yangdi would be endangered.If Wei destroyed an army of Chu and killed its commander,the Wei cities of Chen and ShangCai would be endangered.These two states cannot help you unless they destroy the enemy's force.Why do you value their support so highly?"

越王曰：“所求于晋者，不至顿刃接兵,而况于攻城围邑乎?愿魏以聚大梁之下,愿齐之试兵南阳、莒地，以聚常、郯之境,则方城之外不南,淮、泗之间不东,商、於、析、郦、宗胡之地,夏路以左，不足以备秦，江南、泗上不足以待越矣。则齐、秦、韩、魏得志于楚也，是二晋不战而分地，不耕而获之。不此之为，而顿刃于河山之间以为齐、秦用,所待者如此其失计，奈何其以此王也!”
越王说：“我们并不要求他们出兵作战，更不用说要他们去攻打楚城池了。我们只希望魏国把兵力聚集在大梁城下，而希望齐国在南阳、莒县搞点军事演习，把兵力驻扎在常县、郯县一带就行了。这样一来楚国就不敢再调方城山一带的守军南下，也不敢再调淮河、泗水一带的守军东移，至于商县、於县、析县、酈县以及宗胡一带夏路以西的楚国军队，光是防备秦国也自顾不暇，他们的江南、泗水一带也就无法抵抗越国了。这样一来，齐国、秦国、韩国、魏国就都从楚国得到好处，韩国、魏国不用打仗就分得了地盘，不用耕作就得到了收获。可是韩国、魏国不这么干，而是把兵力消耗到黄河、华山一带去听齐国和秦国使唤，韩国、魏国的办事竟如此失策，他们还有什么资格称王啊!”
The king of Yue replied,"I am not asking these states to cross swords with Chu,let alone storm its cities.I simply want the Wei army to gather at Daliang,and the forces of Qi to muster at Nanyang andJu and gather at Chang and Yan.Then the men of Chu would not dare march south of Fangcheng or east of the Huai and Si Rivers.They would not have strength enough to defend themselves againstQin west of Shang,Yu,Xi,Liand Zonghu,or against Yue along the Yangtse and Si Rivers.Qi,Qin,Han and Wei would hold Chu at bay while the two states of Jin,without resorting to arms,would get their share of Chu's territory,reaping a harvest without ploughing.Instead of this,however, they are contending by the Yellow River and Mount Hua for the terri- tory of Qi and Qin.This is foolish behaviour;how can they become kings like that?”

齐使者曰：“幸也越之不亡也!吾不贵其用智之如目，见豪毛而不见其睫也。今王知晋之失计，而不自知越之过，是目论也”。王所待于晋者，非有马汗之力也,又非可与合军连和也，将待之以分楚众也。今楚众已分，何待于晋?”
齐国的使者说：“你们越国的不被灭亡真是侥幸!聪明智慧之所以可貴就在于它不同于眼睛看东西，眼睛对别人的什么东西都能看得很细但却看不见自己的睫毛。现在大王您能看清韩、魏两国的失算，却看不清越国自己的错误，这正和眼睛看东西的道理一样。您并不要求韩、魏替你尽汗马之劳，更不要求他们与你联合作战，您只不过是希望他们能为您牵扯一点楚国的兵力而已。实际上楚国的兵力现在已经分散了，还何必期待韩、魏呢?”
The envoy of Qi replied,"Luck alone has saved Yue from destruction.It is not wisdom to see fine hairs but not the eyebrow.In the same way,you see the folly of the states of Jin but not the mistakes of Yue.You do not expect Han and Wei to fight for you or enter into amilitary alliance withyou,butonly want them to exhaust Chu's strength. But why place your hopes on them when Chu's forces are already scattered?”

越王曰：“奈何?”曰：“楚三大夫张九军，北围曲沃、於中,以至无假之关者三千七百里,景翠之军北聚鲁、齐、南阳,分有大此者乎?且王之所求者，斗晋、楚也;晋、楚不斗，越兵不起，是知二五而不知十也。此时不攻楚，臣以是知越大不王，小不伯。复雠、庞、长沙,楚之粟也；竟泽陵，楚之材也。越窥兵通无假之关，此四邑者不上贡事于郢矣。臣闻之，图王不王，其敝可以伯。然而不伯者，王道失也。故愿大王之转攻楚也。”
越王说：“你的话是什么意思?”齐国的使者回答说：“楚国的三个大夫分兵九路，北上包围了曲沃、於中，战线向南一直拉到无假关，全长三千七百多里，而景翠统率的军队则北屯到鲁国、齐国以及韩国的南阳一带，兵力分散还有比这个更严重的么?可是您却总希望挑起韩国、魏国同楚国的争端，只要这种争端不挑起你就不攻击楚国，这就好比是只知二五而不知道一十。就因为你们不抓紧现在的时机进攻楚国，所以我说你们既不能称王，也不能称霸。雠县、庞县、长沙，这是楚国的粮食产地；竟泽陵，是楚国盛产木材的地方。越国只要派兵一占领无假关，这四个地区就不再属于楚国了。俗话说，目标是奔着称王，即使不能称王，至少也还可以成为霸主。如果连个霸主都捞不上，那就说明您的路子根本走得不对。所以我们希望您赶紧去攻打楚国。”
The king of Yue asked him to explain himself. He said,"The three ministers of Chu are deploying their armies. They have laid siege to Quwo and Wuzhong in the north and their line extends 3,700 lito the Wujia Pass.Jing Cui's army is stationed in the north near Lu,Qi and Nanyang.Could they have covered a greater area?You are hoping that Han and Wei will fight Chu,and unless they do your army will not advance.This is like a man who does not know that two fives add up to ten.Unless you attack Chu now,you will never become a conqueror or king.Chu gets its grain from Zhou, Pang and Changsha,its timber from the mountains and marshes of Zeling.If you dispatch troops to the Wujia Pass,those four districts will stop sending tribute to the capital of Chu.I have heard that a man who fails to become a king can at least become a conqueror.If you cannot be a great conqueror,it is because you have not followed the kingly way.I advise you,sir,to turn and attack Chu."

于是越遂释齐而伐楚。楚威王兴兵而伐之，大败越，杀王无彊,尽取故吴地至浙江,北破齐于徐州。而越以此散，诸族子争立，或为王，或为君，滨于江南海上，服朝于楚。
于是越国就放弃了齐国转而进攻楚国。楚威王起兵迎战，结果越军大败，越王无彊被杀，过去吴国的全部地盘一直到浙江一带全部被楚国占领，接着楚军又北上在徐州打败了齐国。而越国则从此土崩瓦解，越王家的子弟们散在海边各地，有的称王，有的称君，全都成了楚国的附庸。
Then the king of Yue called off his attack on Qiand turned against Chu,but King Wei of Chu raised an army and utterly routed the troops of Yue,killing King Wujiang and recapturing all the former territory of Wuup to the River Zhe.He also defeated the army of Qiat Xuzhou in the north. Because of this,Yue became disunited and many princes contended for power.Some took the title of prince,others of lord,and they ruled along the seacoast south of the Yangtse,acknowledging the su- zerainty of Chu.

后七世，至闽君摇，佐诸侯平秦。汉高帝复以摇为越王，以奉越后。东越、闽君，皆其后也。
又过了七代，有个闽君摇，曾参加了诸侯们的反秦活动，刘邦即位后又封他为越王，让他接续越国的衣钵。当时的东越和闽君，都是越王句践的后代。
Seven generations later Lord Yao of Minyue joined forces with other states to overthrow the Qin empire.The First Emperor of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.)made him prince of Yue to continue the Yue dynastic sacrifices.The prince of Dongyue and the lord of Minyue were his descendants.

范蠡事越王句践，既苦身劲力,与句践深谋二十余年，竟灭吴，报会稽之耻，北渡兵于淮以临齐、晋，号令中国，以尊周室，句践以霸,而范蠡称上将军。还反国，范蠡以为大名之下，难以久居，且句践为人可与同患，难与处安，为书辞句践曰:“臣闻主忧臣劳，主辱臣死。昔者君王辱于会稽，所以不死，为此事也。今既以雪耻，臣请从会稽之诛。”句践曰：“孤将与子分国而有之。不然，将加诛于子。”范蠡曰：“君行令，臣行意。”乃装其轻宝珠玉，自与其私徒属乘舟浮海以行，终不反。于是句践表会稽山以为范蠡奉邑。
范蠡辅助越王句践，为之筹谋划策，千辛万苦、竭尽全力地奋斗了二十多年，终于帮着句践灭掉了吴国，报了当年被困守会稽山的深仇，并出兵淮河以北压倒了齐、晋等国，对中原各地发号施令，又以尊崇周天子为名，成了天下的霸主，范蠡自己也做了越国的上将军。待至胜利回国以后，范蠡深感到自己在这种名声太大的情况下，是很难长久平安无事的，而且他看透了句践这个人只能与他同患难，而不能同他共安乐，于是写了一封信向句践告辞说：“俗话说主上有忧患，做臣子的就要不辞辛劳；主上受到屈辱，做臣子的就要不惜牺牲。想当初您被困在会稽山，我当时所以不死，就是为了夺取今天的胜利。现在我们的大仇已报，我应该以死来弥补上次的缺陷了。”句践说：“我准备把国家分一半给你。如果你执意不听，我将严厉地惩罚你。”范蠡说：“您有发号施令的权力，我也有按个人意志行动的自由。"于是就带着他那些轻便的金珠玉器，和他的一些亲信仆从乘船渡海，一去不复返。句践无法，只好把会稽山划出来作为范蠡的封地，聊示纪念而已。
For more than twenty years FanLi had toiled without sparing him- self in the service of Goujian,advising the king till at last he overthrew Wuandavenged the disgrace ofKuaiji.When Goujian dispatched troops north of the River Huai to threaten Qi and Jin,lorded it over all the central states and exhorted them to respect the House of Zhou,he became Lord Protector with Fan Li as his supreme commander. After his return Fan Li realized that he was too prominent now for his own safety,for Goujian was a good companion in danger but not in time of peace.He therefore sent a letter to the-king,saying,"I have heard that if something preys on the ruler’s mind,his minister should exert himself.If the ruler is disgraced,his minister should die.When you suffered disgrace at Kuaiji I did not die because I wished to take revenge,but now that we have wiped out our shame I beg to be punished." "I want to share my kingdom with you,"said Goujian."If you refuse,I shall killyou." However,Fan Li replied,“A sovereign gives commands,a subject does what he thinks right.”So gathering together his jewels and pre- cious possessions,he put out to sea with his followers and never re- turned to Yue.Goujian designated Mount Kuaiji as his fief.

范蠡浮海出齐,变姓名，自谓鸱夷子皮,耕于海畔，苦身戮力，父子治产。居无几何，致产数十万。齐人闻其贤，以为相。范蠡喟然叹曰：“居家则致千金,居官则至卿相，此布衣之极也。久受尊名，不祥。”乃归相印，尽散其财，以分与知友乡党,而怀其重宝，间行以去，止于陶,以为此天下之中，交易有无之路通，为生可以致富矣。于是自谓陶朱公。复约要父子耕畜，废居，候时转物,逐什一之利。居无何，则致赀累巨万。天下称陶朱公。
范蠡渡海来到了齐国，改名换姓，自称鸱夷子皮，在海边耕田劳动。父子几个辛辛苦苦地创置家业，没过多久，又积起了几十万的家产。齐国人听说他能干，就去请他做了齐国的宰相。范蠡感慨地叹息说：“在家为民就能积起千金，在朝为官就能位至卿相，一个平民，这已经达到顶点了。过久地享受这种荣誉，是没有好处的。”于是他交回了相印，把他的家财全部散发给了他的朋友和乡亲，又带着一些贵重的宝物，悄悄地离开齐国，来到了陶县。他认为陶县地处天下的中心，是个贸易往来货物集散的枢纽，如果在这里做买卖肯定可以发财。于是他就自称陶朱公。父子几个重新在这里耕田放牧，买进卖出，准确地把握行情，以追求十分之一的利润。没过多久，又积累起了数以亿计的资产。陶朱公的名声传遍天下。
Fan Li went by sea to Qi,where he changed his name and called himself Master Wine-skin.He worked hard with his sons as a farmer on the coast,and amassed considerable property.Soon he had tens of thousands.The men of Qi,knowing his great ability,made him their prime minister. Then Fan Li said with a sigh,"For a private citizen to make thou- sands of pieces of gold or for an official to become a minister are the highest attainments of ordinary men;but no good can come of a long period of fame and nobility.”So he returned the minister's seal,gave allhis money to his friends and neighbours and left quietly with his jewels to settle in Tao,a great commercial centre where a man could grow rich by trading.He now called himself Lord Zhu of Tao.Here once more he and his sons tilled the soil,bred cattle,stored goods and sold them at the right season to make a ten percent profit.In a short time he had amassed tens of thousands again and his name was known throughout the land.

朱公居陶，生少子。少子及壮，而朱公中男杀人，囚于楚。朱公曰：“杀人而死，职也。然吾闻千金之子不死于市。”告其少子往视之。乃装黄金千溢，置褐器中，载以一牛车。且遣其少子,朱公长男固请欲行，朱公不听。长男曰：“家有长子曰家督,今弟有罪，大人不遣,乃遣少弟，是吾不肖。”欲自杀。其母为言曰：“今遣少子，未必能生中子也，而先空亡长男，奈何?”朱公不得已而遣长子，为一封书遗故所善庄生。曰：“至则进千金于庄生所四，听其所为，慎无与争事。”长男既行，亦自私赍数百金。
范蠡在陶县居住的时候，又生了一个小儿子。待至小儿子长大时，范蠡的二儿子杀了人，被楚国关押起来了。范蠡说：“杀人者偿命，这是理所当然的。但是俗话说富贵人家的儿子不能让他死在刑场上。"于是他准备打发他的小儿子去楚国看看。他让小儿子带着黄金千镒装在一条麻袋里，放在一辆牛车上拉着。当小儿子即将出发上路时，范蠡的大儿子坚决请求让他去。范蠡不听。大儿子说：“长子应该是一切家务的总管，现在我的弟弟犯了罪，您不让我去搭救，却让小弟去搭救，这说明我是没有出息的。”于是就要自杀。他的母亲这时也帮着说：“即使派老三去，也未必能救活老二的命，反而先让老大白白地死了，何苦来呢?”范蠡无法只得派老大去了，他写了一封信让老大带着交给自己的好友庄先生。并嘱咐老大说：“你一到楚国就把千金给庄先生送去，听凭他随意处置，不要和他发生任何争执。”大儿子接受了嘱咐，自己又另外带上了几百两金子，于是出发了。
While in Tao,Lord Zhu had a third son.When this boy grew up, the second son was arrested for murder in Chu. "It is right that a murderer should die,"said Lord Zhu."But I have heard that the son of a wealthy family need not die on the execution ground."He ordered his youngest boy to go and make inquiries,pack- ing one thousand yi²of gold³in sacks and loading these on an ox-cart. But as he was sending the young man off,his eldest son insisted on going instead. When Lord Zhu would not agree,his first-born said,"The eldest son ofa family is the guardian of the house.Now my brother is charged with murder,yet you want to send my younger brother instead ofme —I must be a bad son!”He threatened to kill himself. His mother put in,"Sending the youngest may sill not save the second,while the eldest dies first.What use is that?” So Lord Zhu was forced to send his eldest son.He wrote a letter to his old friend Master Zhuang and told his son,“On your arrival, leave the thousand yi of gold with Master Zhuang to dispose of as he thinks fit.Mind you don't argue with him!” The eldest son set off,having added several hundred pieces of gold ofhis own.

至楚，庄生家负郭,披藜藿到门,居甚贫。然长男发书进千金,如其父言。庄生曰：“可疾去矣，慎毋留!即弟出,勿问所以然。”长男既去，不过庄生而私留，以其私赍献遗楚国贵人用事者。
到了楚国，范蠡的大儿子找到了庄先生家，原来庄先生住在一个靠近城墙的地方，房舍四周都长满了荒草，家境非常贫困。但是他还是按照他父亲的嘱咐给庄先生呈上了书信，送交了千金。庄先生说：“你可以赶紧回去了，千万不要在这里停留!一旦你的弟弟被放出来了，你们也不要问他是怎么出来的。”大儿子离开了庄先生家后，并没有走，他在楚都留下来，用他手中所带的那另外的几百两金子去贿赂楚国的当权者。
Upon reaching the Chu capital,he found that Master Zhuang lived in the suburbin a very humble way,his gate choked with brambles.Sill,he gave him the letter and gold as his father had told him. "You may go straight back,"said Zhuang."Don't stay here.And if your brother is released,don't ask the reason." The eldest son withdrew but stayed on in the city,not calling upon Zhuang but using the gold which he had brought separately to bribe a powerful noble of Chu.

庄生虽居穷阎,然以廉直闻于国，自楚王以下皆师尊之。及朱公进金，非有意受也，欲以成事后复归之以为信耳。故金至，谓其妇曰：“此朱公之金。有如病不宿诫,后复归，勿动。”而朱公长男不知其意，以为殊无短长也。
庄先生虽然身居陋巷，但是他那种廉洁正直的名声却无人不知，所以上自楚王以下全国的人都把他当成师长来尊敬。当范蠡让儿子给他送来黄金，他也并不是真想接受，想等到事情办完以后再退还他以表信义。所以当他一见到黄金时，就嘱咐他的妻子说：“这些金子是陶朱公的。没有想到他突然给送了来，我们日后要退给他们，你们不要动。”可是范蠡的大儿子不明白庄先生的想法，以为他对于自己弟弟的死活没有什么办法。
Although Master Zhuanglived in apoor neighbourhood,the whole state knew that he was incorruptible and he was respected by everyone from the king downwards.He had no intention of keeping Lord Zhu's gold,but meant to return it as soon as he had succeeded.He told his wife,"This gold belongs to Lord Zhu.It is like a disease which must not be left untended overnight.Later it must be returned.Don't touch it!” Lord Zhu's eldest son did not know this,however,but thought Zhuang rather lacking in discrimination.

庄生间时入见楚王,言“某星宿某,此则害于楚”。楚王素信庄生，曰：“今为奈何?”庄生曰：“独以德为可以除之。”楚王曰：“生休矣,寡人将行之。”王乃使使者封三钱之府。楚贵人惊告朱公长男曰：“王且赦。”曰：“何以也?”曰：“每王且赦，常封三钱之府。昨暮王使使封之。”朱公长男以为赦，弟固当出也，重千金虚弃庄生，无所为也,乃复见庄生。庄生惊曰：“若不去邪?”长男曰：“固未也。初为事弟，弟今议自赦,故辞生去。”庄生知其意欲复得其金，曰：“若自入室取金。”长男即自入室取金持去，独自欢幸。
庄先生找了一个机会去见楚王说：“现在某颗星星正处在某个位置，这种现象对楚国不利。”楚王一向信任庄先生，就说：“那怎么办好呢?”庄先生说：“只有施恩于人才能免除灾害。”楚王说：“先生去休息吧，我马上就按您说的办。”于是楚王立即派人把钱库封了起来。这时接受了范蠡长子财物的那些楚国权贵们赶紧告诉范蠡的长子说：“大王马上就要宣布大赦。”大儿子问：“有什么证据呢?”权贵们说：“每回大王宣布大赦前，总要把钱库封起来。昨晚大王又派人封钱库了。”范蠡的大儿子以为楚王既然要宣布大赦，他的二弟当然就会被释放的，因此再把千金的重礼白白地送给庄先生，就没有什么必要。于是他借口辞行又到庄先生家里去了。庄先生一见惊讶地说，“你没有走吗?”大儿子说：“本来我就没有走。当初我是为了救二弟来的，现在我弟弟马上就会自己被放出来了，因此我特来向先生辞行。”庄先生明白他的用意是想把金子要回去，于是说：“你自己到屋里去拿你的那些金子吧。”大儿子立刻进入屋内拿了金子走了，自己还觉得挺美。
Zhuang had an audience with the king of Chu and told him that a certain star in a certain quarter of the heavens boded harm to the state. "What can be done?"asked the king,who trusted him implicitly. “Only by doing good can you avert danger.” "Very well,"said the king."I shall take your advice."He sent a man to seal up the treasury.Then the noble told Lord Zhu's eldest son,"The king is going to declare an amnesty.”Asked how he knew,he explained,"Before each amnesty the kingalways seals up the treasury.And yesterday evening he sent to seal it up." The eldest son reflected that if there was to be an amnesty his brother would be released anyhow,andall the gold given Master Zhuang would be wasted.So he went to see Zhuang again. "How is it you haven'tleft?"asked Zhuangin surprise. "I came hoping to save my brother,"was the reply."Now that an amnesty is to be proclaimed,he will be saved in any case.So I have come to bid you goodbye.” Knowing what he wanted,Zhuang said,“Goin and take the gold.” 	The young man took the gold and left,very pleased with himself.

庄生羞为儿子所卖,乃入见楚王曰：“臣前言某星事，王言欲以修德报之。今臣出，道路皆言陶之富人朱公之子杀人囚楚，其家多持金钱赂王左右，故王非能恤楚国而赦,乃以朱公子故也。”楚王大怒曰：“寡人虽不德耳，奈何以朱公之子故而施惠乎!”令论杀朱公子,明日遂下赦令。朱公长男竟持其弟丧归。
庄先生羞愧被一个年轻人所耍，于是又进宫去对楚王说：“我前些天说过某星处某地的事，大王也准备用修德的办法来报答上天。可是今天我出门，听见道上的人们都说是陶县富翁朱公的儿子杀了人被关在楚国，是他们家里用钱贿赂了大王的亲信，所以大王的大赦不是为了体怜楚国人，而只是为了要赦免朱公的儿子。”楚王闻听大怒说：“我的道德水准尽管不高，难道竟可以为了一个朱公的儿子宣告大赦么!”于是下令先把朱公的儿子处决，第二日才宣布了大赦令。结果朱公的大儿子只好拉着他弟弟的尸体回家了。
But Zhuang,annoyed at being tricked by this youth,went back to the king and said,"Last time when I spoke of the stars,sir,you de- cided to avert bad luck by doing good.But now it is the talk of the town that the son of wealthy Lord Zhu of Tao is in prison here for murder and his family has given your ministers substantial bribes.They say you are not declaring an amnesty out of the goodness of your heart but for the sake of Lord Zhu's son.” The king retorted angrily,"I may not be a good man,but I would not do such a thing just for Lord Zhu's son."He ordered the young man's execution,and a general amnesty was proclaimed the next day. So the eldest son had to take back his brother's corpse.

至，其母及邑人尽哀之，唯朱公独笑，曰：“吾固知必杀其弟也!彼非不爱其弟，顾有所不能忍者也。是少与我俱见苦，为生难，故重弃财。至如少弟者，生而见我富，乘坚驱良逐狡兔，岂知财所从来，故轻弃之,非所惜吝。前日吾所为欲遣少子，固为其能弃财故也。而长者不能，故卒以杀其弟，事之理也，无足悲者。吾日夜固以望其丧之来也。”
回家后，他的母亲和邻居们都很哀伤，唯独范蠡笑着说：“我早就料到老大去了必定要断送他二弟的性命!他倒不是不爱他的弟弟，就是因为他舍不得丢掉钱财。他从小跟着我一起操劳，见过受苦，知道生计的艰难，所以他舍不得钱财。至于老三，他一生下来所看见的就是我的富贵，乘高车，赶大马，行围打猎，他哪里知道钱是怎么来的呢?所以随便挥霍，从不知道吝惜。当初我之所以要让他去，就是因为他舍得花钱。而老大不能，所以最后把他二弟的性命断送了。这也是一种定数，不必再难过了。我早就等着老二的尸体回来了。”
When he reached home his mother and the rest of the household mourned.Only Lord Zhu laughed. "I knew he would kill his brother,"he declared."Not that he did not love him,he just could not help himself.He went through hard times with me when he was young,knows how difficult it is to make a living,and therefore hates parting with money.His younger brother has never seen me as otherwise than wealthy,riding in carriages or on fine horses to hunt the hare.Because he has no idea where money comes from,he is prodigal with it and never counts the cost.That is why I wanted to send him.But the eldest is incapable of that,and so he ended up by killing his brother.This is in the nature of things,not a cause for mourning.I have been waiting day and night for his corpse to be brought back.”

故范蠡三徙，成名于天下，非苟去而已，所止必成名。卒老死于陶，故世传曰陶朱公。
范蠡三次搬家，三次都能扬名于天下，所以他不是随随便便地迁移，而是每到一个地方，一定要能够在那里成名。范蠡最后老死在陶县，因此世人都称他为陶朱公。
Fan Li,who moved three times,won a great reputation through- out the land.And he never moved for nothing,but made a name for himself wherever he went.Since he grew old and finally died in Tao,he is known as Lord Zhu of Tao.

太史公曰：禹之功大矣，渐九川,定九州,至于今诸夏艾安。及苗裔句践，苦身焦思，终灭强吴，北观兵中国,以尊周室，号称霸王。句践可不谓贤哉!盖有禹之遗烈焉。范蠡三迁皆有荣名,名垂后世。臣主若此，欲毋显得乎!
太史公说：夏禹的功业太伟大了，他疏通了九川，平定了九州的水患，一直到今天的中原地区都托他的福而安居乐业。到了他的后代句践，经过了艰难奋斗，苦思深谋，终于灭掉了强大的吴国，并进兵到了中原地区，尊崇周天子以号令诸侯，成了一代霸主。这能够说是不伟大吗?在他身上真像是带有大禹的遗德。范蠡三次迁居，迁到哪里都能名声显赫，流传后世。有这样的臣子和君主，要想不让他们显贵，办得到吗!
The Grand Historian comments:Great were the achievements of Yu,who opened up the Nine Rivers and divided the Nine Regions so that the descendants of Xia dwell in peace to this day.His descendant Goujian led a hard life and took anxious thought till at last he suc- ceeded in overthrowing powerful Wu,manifesting the might of his arms to the central states,giving his support to the House of Zhou and winning the title of an Overlord.Undoubtedly he was an able king and a worthy descendant of Yu.Fan Li moved three times but won fame wherever he went,and his name is remembered by later generations. Indeed,how could such a good minister fail to win glory?
