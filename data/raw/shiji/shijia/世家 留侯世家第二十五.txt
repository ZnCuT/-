留侯张良者，其先韩人也。大父开地，相韩昭侯、宣惠王、襄哀王。父平，相肇王、悼惠王。悼惠王二十三年,平卒。卒二十岁，秦灭韩。良年少，未宦事韩。韩破，良家僮三百人,弟死不葬,悉以家财求客刺秦王,为韩报仇，以大父、父五世相韩故。
留侯张良，他的祖先是韩国人。祖父张开地，曾在韩昭侯、宣惠王、襄哀王三朝当过宰相。父亲张平，又在韩鳌王、悼惠王两朝任宰相。悼惠王二十三年，韩国被秦国所灭。张良年岁小，没有赶上在韩国做官。韩国灭亡后，张良家里还很富，有奴仆三百多人。但当他弟弟死时，在葬礼上他却一切从俭，而省着全部财产，都用来寻求刺客，准备刺死秦始皇，为韩国报仇。因为他的祖父和父亲曾在韩国相继做过五朝的宰相。
The ancestors of Zhang Liang,marquis of Liu,came from the state of Han(403B.C.-230B.C.).His grandfather Kaidi served as prime minister to Marquis Zhao,King Xuanhui and King Xiangai of Han. His father Ping was prime minister to King Xiand King Daohui.Zhang Ping died in the twenty-third year of King Daohui,'and twenty years later Han was conquered by Qin.Zhang Liang,still young,held no official position in Han.At the time of the fall of Han he still had three hundred slaves,yet when his younger brother died he did not bury him but used his patrimony to find an assassin who would kill the king of Qin to avenge his state,because his grandfather and father had been ministers of Han during five reigns.

良尝学礼淮阳。东见仓海君，得力士，为铁椎重百二十斤。秦皇帝东游，良与客狙击秦皇帝博浪沙中，误中副车。秦皇帝大怒，大索天下，求贼甚急，为张良故也。良乃更名姓，亡匿下邳。
张良曾经到淮阳学过礼，又到辽东拜访过仓海君。在辽东物色到了一个大力士，此人手持一个重达一百二十斤的大铁锤。当秦始皇往东方巡游时，张良同这个大力士在博浪沙中对秦始皇进行了突然袭击。结果错打了副车，没伤着秦始皇。秦始皇大怒，下令全国搜查，一定要捉到这个刺客。这就是张良他们干的。于是张良只好改名换姓，逃到了下邳隐藏起来。
Zhang Liang went east to study ceremony at Huaiyang,where he met lord Canghai and found a strong man whom he armed with an iron hammer one hundred and twenty catties in weight.When the First Emperor of Qin made a tour of the east,Zhang Liang and the assas- sin attacked him at Bolangsha,but by mistake struck at his attendant's carriage.In fact,Zhang Liang was the cause of the urgent,countrywide search for brigands ordered by the emperor in his rage.But Zhang Liang escaped to Xiapi and went into hiding under an assumed name.

良尝闲从容步游下邳圯上,有一老父，衣褐，至良所，直堕其履圯下,顾谓良曰：“孺子,下取履!”良鄂然，欲殴之。为其老，强忍，下取履。父曰：“履我!”良业为取履，因长跪履之。父以足受，笑而去。良殊大惊，随目之。父去里所,复还，曰：“孺子可教矣。后五日平明，与我会此。”良因怪之，跪曰：“诺。”五日平明，良往。父已先在，怒曰：“与老人期，后,何也?”去，曰：“后五日早会。”五日鸡鸣，良往。父又先在，复怒曰：“后，何也?”去，曰：“后五日复早来。”五日，良夜未半往。有顷，父亦来，喜曰：“当如是。”出一编书,曰：“读此则为王者师矣。后十年兴，十三年孺子见我济北，谷城山下黄石即我矣“。”遂去，无他言，不复见。旦日视其书，乃《太公兵法》也。良因异之，常习诵读之。
这期间，张良闲着无事曾有一次随便在下邳的桥上散步，这时有一个穿着粗麻布短衣的老人走到张良跟前，故意把自己的鞋子甩到了桥下，转头对张良说：“小伙子，下去把鞋给我捡上来!”张良猛吃一惊，真想揍他一顿。但一看他这么大年纪了，就强压着怒火，下去把鞋捡了上来。老人把脚一伸说：“给我穿上!”张良心想既然已经给他捡上来了，那就给他穿吧，于是就跪下身去给老人穿好了鞋。老人伸着脚等张良给他穿好鞋后，才满意地笑着走了。张良目送着老人的背影，心里很吃惊。那位老人走出去一里来地，又转身回来了，他对张良说：“小伙子，你很有培养前途。五天后的黎明，你我在这儿会面。”张良越发觉得奇怪了，很恭敬地回答说：“好的。”到了第五天，天才蒙蒙亮，张良到桥头去了，结果一看老人早已先在那里等了好久了。老人生气地对张良说：“同老人约会，为什么这样迟到?”说完回身就走，并说：“再过五天早点来。”到了第五天鸡刚叫，张良就来到了桥头，结果老人又先在那里等着了。老人更生气地说：“又迟到了，怎么搞的?”说完回头便走，并说：“再过五天，记着要早点来。”到了第五天，还不到半夜，张良就到桥头去了。过了一会儿，老人来了，高兴地说：“本来就应当这样!”于是拿出一编竹简交给张良说：“好好地通读这部书，就可以成为帝王之师了。再过十年，将有王者兴起。再过十三年，你我将在济北见面，那时你如果在谷城山下见到一块黄石头，那就是我。”说完就走了，没有再说别的话，从此也没有再见过这个人。等到天亮，张良一看这部书，原来是《太公兵法》。于是张良惊奇地把它视为珍宝，经常地研究记诵。
One day he was strolling idly across the bridge at Xiapi when an old man in rough homespun approached,dropped a shoe under the bridge and,turning to Zhang Liang,said,"Boy!Go down,and fetch my slipper!”Zhang Liang was astounded and wanted to hit the fellow. But controlling himself on account of the other's age,he went down to fetch the shoe. "Put it on for me,"ordered the old man.And since Zhang Liang had already fetched the shoe,he knelt down to put it on.The old man stretched out his foot for it,then left with a smile while Zhang Liang watched in amazement.After going some distance the old man came back."You can be taught,boy,"he said."Meet me here five days from now at dawn.” Zhang Liang,his curiosity aroused,knelt down to answer,"I will." At dawn five days later he went back to the place.The old man, there before him,said angrily,"What do you mean by keeping an old man waiting?Come earlier five days from now."With that he left. Five days later Zhang Liang went earlier,only to find the old man already there.He was told to come back after another five days. This time Zhang Liang went before midnight.Presently the old man arrived."That's right!"he said approvingly and handed him a book with the injunction,"Read this and you will become the teacher of kings.Ten years from now you will prosper.Thirteen years from now you will once more encounter me,as the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng north of the River Ji.”Without another word he left and did not appear again.When day broke Zhang Liang examined the book and found it was The Patriarch Li Shangs Arnt of War.Prizing this work,he pored over it again and again.

居下邳，为任侠。项伯常杀人，从良匿。
张良在下邳居住期间，仍是经常做一些行侠仗义的事情。项羽的叔叔项伯当时杀了人，就是跑到张良这里来藏着。
He remained in Xiapi as a champion ofjustice and helped to conceal Xiang Bo after he killed a man.

后十年，陈涉等起兵,良亦聚少年百余人。景驹自立为楚假王,在留。良欲往从之，道遇沛公。沛公将数千人，略地下邳西，遂属焉。沛公拜良为厩将。良数以《太公兵法》说沛公，沛公善之，常用其策。良为他人言，皆不省。良曰：“沛公殆天授。”故遂从之，不去见景驹。
十年过后，陈涉等人果然起兵了。于是张良也趁机纠集起一百多人，起来反秦。这时，景驹立为代理楚王，驻兵留县，张良想去投奔他，结果半道上遇见了刘邦。这时，刘邦正带着几千人开辟地盘，来到了下邳城西，于是张良就归了刘邦，刘邦让张良给他当管马的官。这期间，张良常给刘邦讲《太公兵法》。刘邦很高兴，经常采纳他的主张。这些话张良也对别人讲过，但那些人却总是不开窍。张良说：“沛公的智慧，大概是老天爷赐给他的。”因而就跟上了刘邦，不再去找景驹了。
Ten years later Chen She and the others revolted,and Zhang Liang gathered a band of more than a hundred young men.When JingJu made himself the acting king of Chu in Liu,Zhang Liang decided to join him;but on the way he met Liu Bang,then in command of several thousand men who were conquering the region west of Xiapi,and he threw in his lot with him.Liu Bang made him a cavalry officer.Zhang Liang expounded The PatriarchLi ShangsAnt of Warto him on several occasions and he approved of the book and made use of its strategies, although Zhang Liang found others could not understand them.Struck by Liu Bang's natural genius,he followed him instead of joining Jing Ju.

及沛公之薛，见项梁。项梁立楚怀王。良乃说项梁曰：“君已立楚后，而韩诸公子横阳君成贤，可立为王，益树党。”项梁使良求韩成，立以为韩王。以良为韩申徒,与韩王将千余人西略韩地，得数城，秦辄复取之，往来为游兵颍川。
等刘邦到了薛县，见了项梁，这时项梁已经拥立了楚怀王。于是张良就劝项梁说：“您已经拥立了楚国的后代为王，而韩国的后代横阳君韩成也很贤明，也可以立他为王，这样楚国也多一个盟友。”于是项梁就派张良去找来了公子韩成，立他为韩王，让张良给他做宰相。张良和韩成率领着一千多人西行开辟韩地。开始攻占了几个城邑，但很快又被秦军夺回去了。他们只好在颍川一带来回打游击。
When Liu Bang went to Xue to see Xiang Liang,who had set up King Huai of Chu,Zhang Liang advised Xiang Liang saying,"You have enthroned a descendant of the royal house of Chu.Lord Cheng of Hengyang of the House of Han is also a worthy man.If you make him a king you will win another ally.” So Xiang Liang sent him to find Lord Cheng and make him king of Han with Zhang Liang as his minister.Zhang Liang went with the king of Han and over a thousand men to conquer the territory of Han in the west,but each time they took a city the army of Qin recaptured it.So they carried on mobile warfare in Yingchuan.

沛公之从雒阳南出辗辕,良引兵从沛公，下韩十余城，击破杨熊军。沛公乃令韩王成留守阳翟，与良俱南，攻下宛,西入武关。沛公欲以兵二万人击秦晓下军,良说曰：“秦兵尚强，未可轻。臣闻其将屠者子，贾竖易动以利。愿沛公且留壁,使人先行，为五万人具食，益为张旗帜诸山上，为疑兵，令郦食其持重宝啖秦将。”秦将果畔，欲连和俱西袭咸阳，沛公欲听之。良曰：“此独其将欲叛耳，恐士卒不从。不从必危，不如因其解击之四。”沛公乃引兵击秦军，大破之。逐北至蓝田，再战，秦兵竟败。遂至咸阳，秦王子婴降沛公。
等到刘邦从洛阳出辗辕关南下时，张良又引兵与刘邦会合了，他跟着刘邦一连攻下了韩地的十多个城池，又打败了秦朝杨熊的军队。于是刘邦就派韩成留守阳翟，而让张良跟着他一道南进，攻下了宛城，接着向西挺进，攻入了武关。这时刘邦想用两万人强攻镇守晓关的秦朝军队。张良说：“目前秦军的战斗力还很强，不能轻敌!我听说镇守晓关的将领，是一个屠户的儿子。商人都唯利是图，我们可以用财宝引诱他。您可以先坚守营地，而派出一部分人先到前边去为五万人准备粮食，同时在四周的山头上多树旗帜，虚张声势，迷惑敌人。而后派郦食其带着奇珍异宝去关上贿赂秦国的守将。”秦将果然中计，答应了和刘邦一起袭击咸阳。刘邦正要同意，张良说：“这还只是那个受贿赂的将军想造反，他的部下还不一定听呢!如果他的部下不听，那就要坏事。不如趁着他们思想松懈，对他们发起突然进攻。”刘邦同意，于是引兵突袭蛲关，秦军无备，烧关失守了。接着刘邦乘胜追击到蓝田，与秦军再战，秦军彻底瓦解。刘邦胜利地进入了咸阳，秦王子婴向刘邦投降了。
When Liu Bang marched south from Luoyang through Xuanyuan, Zhang Liang led his men to join him and together they captured more than ten cities of Han and routed Yang Xiong's army.Then Liu Bang ordered King Cheng of Han to defend Yangdi while he went south with Zhang Liang and stormed Wan before advancing west through the Wu Pass.He planned to lead twenty thousand men against the forces of Qin at the Yao Pass,but Zhang Liang said,"Don't underestimate the men of Qin—they are still a powerful force.I hear their general is a butcher's son,and stradesmen are easily tempted by gain.Why not entrench yourself here,send a force ahead with provisions for fifty thousand and set up banners onall the hills around to dismay the enemy, while Li Yijigoes with rich gifts to bribe him?” The Qin general did in fact surrender and offered to advance west with Liu Bang against Xianyang.Liu Bang would have agreed,but Zhang Liang warned,"The general is willing to surrender but I doubt ifhis troops will follow suit.That would put us in a dangerous position. Better strike while they are off their guard."So Liu Bang attacked and defeated the army of Qin,then marched north to Lantian where he routed the Qin forces again.When he reached Xianyang,Ziying,king of Qin, surrendered.

沛公入秦宫，宫室帷帐狗马重宝妇女以千数,意欲留居之。樊哙谏沛公出舍,沛公不听。良曰：“夫秦为无道，故沛公得至此。夫为天下除残贼，宜缟素为资。今始入秦，即安其乐，此所谓‘助桀为虐’。且‘忠言逆耳利于行，毒药苦口利于病’,愿沛公听樊哙言。”沛公乃还军霸上。
刘邦进了宫，宫室里声色狗马、奇珍异宝，不计其数，单是美女就有几千人。刘邦就想住在里头不走了。樊哙一再劝他到外面住，刘邦不听。张良说：“正因为秦朝荒淫无道，所以您今天才打到这里。既然我们是为天下除害，那就应该以俭朴为本。现在才刚刚打进了秦京，您就想要过他们昏君的那种享乐日子，这就叫‘助桀为虐’。俗话说‘忠言逆耳利于行，良药苦口利于病’,希望您接受樊哙的劝告。”于是刘邦退出皇宫，回军到霸上驻扎。
Liu Bang,entering the Qin palaces,found there hangings,curtains, hounds,horses,treasures and women by the thousand.Tempted to stay there,he ignored the advice of Fan Kuai,who urged him to camp outside. Zhang Liang said,"You are here because Qin did not rule well. And now that you have rid the world of a tyrant,you should trade on frugality.If the moment you enter Qin you indulge in its pleasures,you will just be out-doing the despot.Home truths grate on the ears yet are good guides to action;strong medicine tastes bitter yet helps to cure disease.'I hope you will take Fan Kuai's advice.”Then Liu Bang with- drew his troops and stationed them at Bashang.

项羽至鸿门下,欲击沛公，项伯乃夜驰入沛公军，私见张良，欲与俱去。良曰：“臣为韩王送沛公，今事有急，亡去不义。”乃具以语沛公。沛公大惊，曰：“为将奈何?”良曰：“沛公诚欲倍项羽邪?”沛公曰：“鲰生教我距关无内诸侯,秦地可尽王，故听之。”良曰：“沛公自度能却项羽乎?”沛公默然良久，曰“固不能也。今为奈何?”良乃固要项伯，项伯见沛公，沛公与饮为寿，结宾婚。令项伯具言沛公不敢倍项羽，所以距关者，备他盗也。及见项羽后解，语在《项羽》。
项羽的军队来到鸿门后，想要进击刘邦。项伯连夜跑到刘邦兵营去见张良，想叫张良离开。张良说：“我是受韩王之托跟着沛公打到这里的，今天沛公有了危险，我一个人逃跑了，这太不仗义。”于是进去把项伯的话一一地告诉了刘邦。刘邦一听，吃惊地说：“这可怎么办好呢?”张良说：“您当初是真想背叛项羽吗?”刘邦说：“有个无知的小子教我把住关口，不让诸侯们进来，那样，秦国的地盘就可以全部归我，我就可以称王了。所以我听了他的话。”张良说：“您自己估量，您能够打退项羽吗?”刘邦沉默了好一会儿才说：“当然不可能。现在咱该怎么办呢?”于是张良便坚决请项伯进来与刘邦相见，刘邦给项伯敬酒，并与他结成了儿女亲家。刘邦请项伯给项羽带话说他根本没有叛变项羽的意思。至于派人守关，那是为了防备土匪的骚扰。后来刘邦又亲自见到了项羽，问题才得以解决。这些事详细记述在《项羽本纪》中。
When Xiang Yu,arriving in Hongmen,decided to attack Liu Bang, Xiang Bo hastened by night to their camp and secretly urged Zhang Liang to leave with him.But Zhang Liang said,“I came on behalf of my prince to help Liu Bang.It would not be right to desert him in his hour of danger." He reported the whole matter to Liu Bang,who asked in consternation,"What shall I do?" "Do you really intend to oppose Xiang Yu?"asked Zhang Liang. “A worthless fellow advised me to hold the Pass against the other princes so that I could rule over the whole of Qin.I acted on his advice." “Do you believe you can defeat Xiang Yu?” After quite a long silence he answered,"No,of course not.What shall I do?” Then Zhang Liang urged Xiang Bo to come in and see Liu Bang, who drank a toast to him,promised to link their families by marriage, and asked him to explain to Xiang Yu that he would never think of betraying him and had simply held the Pass against brigands.So Xiang Bo went back and cleared up this matter,as has been recorded in the account of Xiang Yu.

汉元年正月,沛公为汉王，王巴、蜀。汉王赐良金百溢，珠二斗，良具以献项伯。汉王亦因令良厚遗项伯，使请汉中地。项王乃许之，遂得汉中地。汉王之国,良送至褒中，遣良归韩。良因说汉王曰：“王何不烧绝所过栈道,示天下无还心，以固项王意。”乃使良还。行，烧绝栈道。
汉高祖元年正月，刘邦被封为汉王，统管巴、蜀地区。刘邦赏给张良黄金百镒、宝珠二斗，张良把这些全部转送给了项伯。刘邦又通过张良厚赠项伯，让项伯帮他向项羽请求汉中地区。项羽答应了，于是刘邦又获得了汉中一带。刘邦要到他的封地去了，张良送他们到褒中，刘邦才让张良回到韩国去。张良临别前对刘邦说：“大王不如把走过的这条栈道烧掉，这可以向人们表示您没有再打回去的想法，可以哄得项羽对您放心。”于是刘邦就让张良在回去的路上边走边烧，整个栈道被烧光了。
In the first month of the first year of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.),Liu Bang became king of Han ruling over Ba and Shu.He gave Zhang Liang a hundred yi of gold and two pecks of pearls,all of which Zhang Liang presented to Xiang Bo.Liu Bang also sent rich gifts to Xiang Bo through ZhangLiang with a request for Hanzhong,and since Xiang Yu agreed Iiu Bang obtained this district. When Liu Bang set off to his kingdom,Zhang Liang accompa- nied him as far as Baozhong before he was told to return.He advised Liu Bang saying,"Why not burn the plank road through the mountains? This would show the world you have no intention of marching east again and reassure Xiang Yu.”Liu Bang,having sent him off,went on, destroying the plank road on his way.

良至韩，韩王成以良从汉王故，项王不遣成之国，从与俱东。良说项王曰：“汉王烧绝栈道，无还心矣。”乃以齐王田荣反书告项王。项王以此无西忧汉心，而发兵北击齐。
张良回到韩国时，因为韩成当初让张良跟了刘邦，所以项羽怀恨，不派韩成回韩国，而是带着一道回了彭城。张良到了彭城对项羽说：“刘邦自己烧毁了栈道，这说明他没有打回来的意思了。”接着又把齐王田荣起兵倒项的檄文送给了项羽，于是项羽便不再防备西边的刘邦，而专心致志地引兵北上去攻打齐国了。
Upon his return to Han(403B.C.-230B.C.),Zhang Liang found that King Cheng had not been allowed to go there but had been taken east by Xiang Yu,because Zhang Liang was on the side of Liu Bang. He told Xiang Yu,"Liu Bang has destroyed the plank road and has no intention of coming east again."He also informed him of the revolt of King Tian Rong of Qi.Then Xiang Yu set his mind at rest about Liu Bang in the west,and led an army north against Qi.

项王竟不肯遣韩王，乃以为侯，又杀之彭城。良亡，间行归汉王，汉王亦已还定三秦矣。复以良为成信侯，从东击楚。至彭城，汉败而还。至下邑，汉王下马踞鞍而问曰:“吾欲捐关以东等弃之,谁可与共功者?”良进曰：“九江王黥布，楚枭将，与项王有郄;彭越与齐王田荣反梁地:此两人可急使。而汉王之将独韩信可属大事，当一面。即欲捐之，捐之此三人，则楚可破也。”汉王乃遣随何说九江王布，而使人连彭越。及魏王豹反,使韩信将兵击之，因举燕、代、齐、赵。然卒破楚者，此三人力也。
项羽最终也没有让韩成去韩国，先是把他降位为侯，后来又在彭城把他杀了。张良闻风逃走，抄小路又西去投奔了刘邦。而刘邦这时已经卷土重来，又收复了关中。刘邦封张良为成信侯，让他跟着一道东征项羽。刘邦开始乘虚占领了彭城，后来又被项羽回师打败。当他们西逃到下邑时，刘邦下马坐着马鞍子休息，他问人们：“如果我豁着把函谷关以东的地盘都分给他们，谁可以帮我一道破楚立功?”张良进前一步说：“九江王黥布，是项羽的猛将，现在正和项羽闹矛盾；彭越和齐王田荣相勾结，正在梁地坚持倒项。这两个人可以迅速利用。在您的部下只有韩信可以委派重任，让他去独当一面。假如您真想把地盘拿出来，那就分给他们三个，那么项羽肯定可以打败。”于是刘邦就派了随何去劝说九江王黥布，又派了其他人去联合彭越。等到魏王豹反叛抗汉时，刘邦又派了韩信前去征讨，韩信遂平定了燕、代、齐、赵等国的大片地区。刘邦最终所以能够打败项羽就是靠着这三个人的力量。
Xiangyu would not let King Cheng go,however,but made him a marquis and then had him killed at Pengcheng. Zhang Liang fled to join Liu Bang,who by then had marched back and conquered the three states of Qin.Zhang Liang,made mar- quis of Chengxin,went east with the army of Han(206B.C.-8A.D.)to attack Chu. At Pengcheng the Han army was defeated and Liu Bang retreated to Xiayi.Unsaddling his horse to squat on the saddle,he said,"I mean to give up all the land east of the Pass to someone who will make common cause with me.Can you suggest anyone?”

张良多病，未尝特将也,常为画策臣，时时从汉王。
张良体弱多病，没有领兵独当一面，他只是作为一个出谋划策的人物，经常跟在刘邦身边。
Zhang Liang stepped forward and said,“Ying Bu,king ofJiujiang, is an able Chu general who hates Xiang Yu.Or there is Peng Yue,who has rebelled with King Tian Rong of Qi in Liang.Both men would serve in this emergency.Of your own generals,Han Xin alone is ca- pable of great things and can play an independent part.If you mean to give up this territory,give it to these three men.Then Xiang Yu can be defeated." Liu Bang sent Sui He to win over Ying Bu and another envoy to make an alliance with Peng Yue.And when King Bao of Wei rebelled, he dispatched Han Xin against him with an army.So he conquered Yan,Dai,Ji and Zhao.And the final overthrow of Chu was thanks to these three men.

汉三年，项羽急围汉王荥阳，汉王恐忧，与郦食其谋桡楚权。食其曰：“昔汤伐桀，封其后于杞。武王伐纣，封其后于宋。今秦失德弃义，侵伐诸侯社稷，灭六国之后，使无立锥之地。陛下诚能复立六国后世，毕已受印，此其君臣百姓必皆戴陛下之德，莫不向风慕义，愿为臣妾。德义已行，陛下南向称霸，楚必敛衽而朝。”汉王曰：“善。趣刻印，先生因行佩之矣。”
汉高祖三年，项羽把刘邦围困在荥阳，形势非常危急，刘邦和邸食其商量如何削弱项羽的势力。邮食其说：“从前商汤打败夏桀之后，把夏的后代封在杞国。周武王灭纣之后，把商朝的后代封在宋国。而秦朝不行德义，灭了东方六国，竟使他们的后代没有立足之地。您今天如果能把六国的后代再封立起来，都发给他们印信，那么这些国家的君臣百姓，一定都会感戴您的恩德，仰慕您的风范，愿意给您做臣仆。到那时，您的德义风行天下，您也就可以成为霸主，项羽也就只好乖乖地向您俯首称臣了。”刘邦说：“好!赶快叫人刻印，刻好印您就可以带着去办了。"
Zhang Liang's health was poor and he never com- manded an army,but in his capacity as an adviser he was constantly with the king. In the third year of Han,Xiang Yu beset Liu Bang so hard at Xingyang that in alarm he asked Li Yiji how to weaken the power of Chu. "When Tang conquered KingJie of the Xia Dynasty,"said Li Yiji, “he gave the land of Qito his descendants.When King Wu conquered King Zhou of the Shang Dynasty,he gave Song to his descendants. But Qin,abandnoning virtue and justice,has abolished the ancestral sacrifices ofthe six princes and disinherited their descendants,leaving them not a single inch ofland.If you restore the descendants of the six royal houses and present them with seals,then they,their ministers and their people will acknowledge your virtue and turn towards you in admiration,willing to be your subjects.When you have done such deeds of virtue and justice,you can rule as the overlord and Xiang Yu will have to submit to your sovereignty." “Good!"said Liu Bang."Have the seals cut at once and you can set out with them."

食其未行，张良从外来谒。汉王方食，曰：“子房前!客有为我计桡楚权者。”具以郦生语告，曰：“于子房何如?”良曰：“谁为陛下画此计者?陛下事去矣。”汉王曰：“何哉?”张良对曰：“臣请藉前箸为大王筹之。”曰：“昔者汤伐桀而封其后于杞者，度能制桀之死命也。今陛下能制项籍之死命乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可一也。武王伐纣封其后于宋者，度能得纣之头也。今陛下能得项籍之头乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可二也。武王入殷，表商容之闾，释箕子之拘，封比干之墓。今陛下能封圣人之墓，表贤者之闾，式智者之门乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可三也。发巨桥之粟，散鹿台之钱，以赐贫穷。今陛下能散府库以赐贫穷乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可四矣。殷事已毕，偃革为轩，倒置干戈，覆以虎皮,以示天下不复用兵。今陛下能偃武行文，不复用兵乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可五矣。休马华山之阳,示以无所为。今陛下能休马无所用乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可六矣。放牛桃林之阴，以示不复输积。今陛下能放牛不复输积乎?”曰：“未能也。”“其不可七矣。且天下游士离其亲戚，弃坟墓，去故旧，从陛下游者，徒欲日夜望咫尺之地。今复六国，立韩、魏、燕、赵、齐、楚之后，天下游士各归事其主，从其亲戚，反其故旧坟墓，陛下与谁取天下乎?其不可八矣。且夫楚唯无强，六国立者复桡而从之,陛下焉得而臣之?诚用客之谋，陛下事去矣。”汉王辍食吐哺,骂曰：“竖儒，几败而公事!”令趣销印。
邮食其还没有出发，张良正好从外面来见刘邦。刘邦当时正在吃饭，他一见张良便说：“子房过来!有人帮我想了一个削弱项羽势力的办法。”接着就把郦食其的主意向张良说了一遍。随后问道：“您看这个做法如何?”张良说：“谁给您出的这个主意?这样一来您的大事就要完了!”刘邦说：“为什么?”张良说：“请把您的筷子给我，让我给您摆摆看。”他说：“当初商汤讨伐夏桀后，所以还封夏的后代于杞国，那是商汤有把握可以置夏桀于死地。您今天能够置项羽于死地吗?”刘邦说：“不能。”张良说：“这是第一个不行。周武王讨伐殷纣王，所以还封殷的后代于宋国，那是周武王有把握能得到殷纣的人头。您今天能得到项羽的人头吗?”刘邦说：“也不能。”张良说：“这是第二个不行。周武王进入殷都后，曾在商容住过的里巷口立表表彰他，曾把箕子从监狱里放出来，而且给比干重修了坟墓。您今天能够去为圣人修墓，去为贤人的里巷口立表表彰，到那些智者的门前去表示敬意吗?”刘邦说：“也不能。”张良说：“这是第三个不行。周武王当时能拿巨桥仓库的粮食和鹿台所存的钱币，来救济贫穷，您今天能把仓库里的东西拿出来去救济贫穷吗?”刘邦说：“也不能。”张良说：“这是第四个不行。周武王伐纣的战争一结束，立刻把战车改为轩车，把兵器倒过头来用虎皮蒙上，表示今后永远不再使用它们了。您今天能够弃武用文，不再打仗吗?”刘邦说：“不能。”张良说：“这是第五个不行。周武王当时还把战马放牧在华山的南坡，表示以后不用它们了。您今天也能把马放出去，不再用它们吗?”刘邦说：“不能。”张良说：“这是第六个不行。周武王当时还把运输队的牛放牧到桃林塞的北面，表示他今后不再运送军饷。您今天也能把牛放出去，不再运送军饷吗?”刘邦说：“不能。”张良说：“这是第七个不行。所有的谋士游客们，他们所以能够离乡背井抛开亲友不顾而来跟着您，他们日夜所盼的也就是希望有朝一日能分到一小块地盘。现在您重新建立起六个国家，让昔日韩、魏、燕、赵、齐、楚六国的后代去为王，那么今天您身边的这些谋士游客们也就全都各自回去侍奉他们的主子，各自回到他们的亲戚故旧、本乡本土上去了，到那时您还靠谁来帮您打天下呢?这是第八个不行。而且今天项羽是最强不过的，您把六国立起来，六国立刻就会屈服于项羽，谁还会来听从您的指挥呢?您要真是采用了这个主意，您的事情全完了!”刘邦一听，气得一口吐出了嘴里的东西，骂道：“这个儒家小子!差点坏了老子的大事!”下令赶紧把那些印章毁掉。
Zhang Liang happened to come in before Li Yijilefton this mission. Liu Bang who was at his meal called,“Come over herel Someone has proposed a plan to weaken Chu's power."Having told Zhang Liang all Li Yiji had said,he asked,“What do you think?” “Who made this plan?"asked Zhang Liang."This will be your ruin!” "In what way?"asked Liu Bang. “Give me your chopsticks and let me explain.When Tang con- quered the Jie he gave Qi to his descendants because he had power of life and death over them.Have you power of life and death over Xiang Yu?” "No,I have not." "Fallacy number one.When King Wu conquered the Shangs,he gave Song to his descendants because he knew he could cut off the head of the Shang king.Can you cut off Xiang Yu's head?”“No,I cannot.” "Fallacy number two.When King Wu took the Shang capital,he honoured Shang Rong's lane,released Ji Zi from prison and enlarged Bi Gan's grave.Are you in a position to enlarge a sage's grave,honour a good man's lane or a wise man's gate?” "No,I am not." "Fallacy number three.King Wu was able to distribute the grain stored at Juqiao and the money stored at Lutai among the poor.Are you able to distribute grain and money to the poor?” "No,I am not." "Fallacy number fout.After his conquest of Shang,King Wu con- verted war chariots into carriages,while shields and spears were laid down and covered with tiger skins to show the world that there would be on more war.Are you in a position to lay down arms,practise the arts of peace and end all wars?” "No,I am not." "Fallacy number five.King Wu grazed his horses south of Mount Hua to show that there would be no more unrest.Are you in a position to turn your horses loose?” “No,I am not.” "Fallacy number six.King Wu pastured his cattle north of Taolin to show that there would be no more transport duty.Are you in a position to do that?” "No,I am not." "Fallacy number seven.Itinerant scholars from all over the world have left their homes,ancestral graves and friends to follow you just in the hope of getting a little land.If you restore the six states and en- throne the descendants of the royal houses of Han(403B.C.-230B.C.), Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.),Yan,Zhao,Qi and Chu,all these gentlemen will go back to serve their old masters,returning to their homes,friends and ancestral graves.Then who will help you to win your empire?This is fallacy number eight.Your main task now is to stop Chu from growing stronger.If the six states are restored and follow Xiang Yu,how can you subjugate Chu?If you really adopt this plan,it will be your ruin.” Liu Bang stopped eating and spat the food out of his mouth. "That fool ofa pedant nearly did for me!"he swore.He gave orders at once to have the seals cancelled.

汉四年,韩信破齐而欲自立为齐王,汉王怒。张良说汉王,汉王使良授齐王信印，语在《淮阴》事中。
汉高祖四年，韩信灭掉齐国后，想要自己做齐王，刘邦听说很生气，张良劝住了刘邦。刘邦于是派张良带着印信去封韩信做了齐王。这件事详细记载在《淮阴侯列传》中。
In the fourth year of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.),Han Xin conquered Qi and wanted to make himself king there.Liu Bang was angry,but Zhang Liang persuaded him to give Han Xin the seal of a king,as is recorded in the account of Han Xin.

其秋，汉王追楚至阳夏南,战不利而壁固陵，诸侯期不至。良说汉王,汉王用其计，诸侯皆至。语在《项籍》事中。
同年秋天，刘邦追项羽到阳夏南，又被项羽打败，无可奈何地退守固陵，而各路诸侯的军队到了约定时间都故意不来，这时张良又出了主意。刘邦采用了张良的主意后，各路诸侯的兵马就来了。这件事详细记述在《项羽本纪》中。
That autumn Liu Bang pursued Xiang Yu to south of Yangxia; then,being worsted in battle,he entrenched himself in Guling,but the other commanders failed to come to his aid.Only when he acted on Zhang Liang's advice did the reinforcements come,as is recorded in the account of Xiang Yu.

汉六年正月，封功臣。良未尝有战斗功，高帝曰：“运筹策帷帐中,决胜千里外，子房功也。自择齐三万户。”良曰：“始臣起下邳，与上会留，此天以臣授陛下。陛下用臣计，幸而时中，臣愿封留足矣，不敢当三万户。”乃封张良为留侯，与萧何等俱封。
汉高祖六年正月，分封开国功臣，张良没有带兵打仗独当一面的功绩。刘邦说：“决策于大帐中，制胜于千里外，这就是张良的功劳。你可以在齐地自己选择三万户作封邑。”张良说：“当初我自己在下邳起兵，到留县遇上了您，这是老天爷把我交给您的，您采纳了我的意见，有的也的确让我给蒙上了。现在我只要一个留县就够了，不敢领受这三万户的厚赏。”于是刘邦便封张良为留侯，与萧何等人一起受封。
In the first month of the sixth year of Han,fiefs were given for outstanding services.Zhang Liang had never distinguished himself in battle,but the emperor said,"The strategies you planned in your tent won battles for us a thousand liaway—that is your achievement.Take your choice of any thirty thousand households in Qi.” Zhang Liang answered,"After I rebelled at XiapiI met you at Liu. Heaven sent to you,and I am glad that some of the plans I proposed proved useful.I shall be satisfied with the district of Liu as my fief.I cannot accept thirty thousand households.”So Zhang Liang was made marquis of Liu at the same time as Xiao He and the others were enfeoffed.

上已封大功臣二十余人,其余日夜争功不决，未得行封。上在雒阳南宫,从复道望见诸将往往相与坐沙中语。上曰：“此何语?”留侯曰：“陛下不知乎?此谋反耳。”上曰：“天下属安定,何故反乎?”留侯曰：“陛下起布衣，以此属取天下,今陛下为天子，而所封皆萧、曹故人所亲爱，而所诛者皆生平所仇怨。今军吏计功，以天下不足遍封，此属畏陛下不能尽封，恐又见疑平生过失及诛，故即相聚谋反耳。”上乃忧曰：“为之奈何?”留侯曰：“上平生所憎，群臣所共知，谁最甚者?”上曰：“雍齿与我故，数尝窘辱我。我欲杀之，为其功多，故不忍。”留侯曰：“今急先封雍齿以示群臣，群臣见雍齿封，则人人自坚矣。”于是上乃置酒，封雍齿为什方侯,而急趣丞相、御史定功行封。群臣罢酒，皆喜曰：“雍齿尚为侯，我属无患矣。”
待至刘邦封过二十几个大功臣时，其余的就开始互相攀比，日夜争吵不休，直闹得刘邦分封不下去了。有一天刘邦在洛阳南宫的空中走廊上向下闲望，看见将领们三三两两地坐在沙堆上在议论什么。刘邦问张良：“这些人在议论什么?”张良说：“您还不知道吗?他们正在商量着造反呢。”刘邦说：“天下才刚刚安定下来，他们为什么又要造反呢?”张良说：“您出身于一个平民百姓，靠着他们给您夺得了天下，现在您做了皇帝，您所封的都是萧何、曹参等这种亲密的老朋友，而杀掉的都是您平常所恨的人。现在军事长官们统计一下各人的功劳，恐怕把整个国家都封出去也不够。因而他们害怕得不到封赏；另外他们还担心过丈记去曾在您面前有过什么过失，怕您把他们杀掉，所以他们就一起商量着要造反。”刘邦一听很担忧地说：“那我们该怎么办呢?”张良说：“您平常所最恨而人们也都知道的是谁?”刘邦说：“是雍齿。雍齿与我有旧仇，曾几次让我吃了苦头。我总想杀他，但又因为他功多，所以一直没忍心下手。”张良说：“那就赶快先封赏雍齿，给他们做个样子，他们一见雍齿都能受封，他们自己也就安心了。”于是刘邦立即大摆酒席，封雍齿为什方侯，当众催促丞相、御史让他们赶快给大家评定功劳，赶快进行封赏。宴会一结束，大臣们都高兴地说：“雍齿都能被封侯，我们就不用担心了!”
That same year,after the emperor had enfeoffed more than twenty men with great achievements to their credit,the others disputed day and night and could not reach agreement,so that the work of enfeoff- ment was held up.One day in his Southern Palace in Luoyang,the emperor looked down from a terrace and saw some generals sitting by the river and talking together."What are they discussing?"he asked. "Don’t you know,sir?"replied Zhang Liang."They are plotting rebellion.” “Peace has just been restored.Why should they revolt?”"You started out as a common citizen but with their help won the empire.Since becoming the emperor you have ennobled close friends like Xiao He and Cao Shen and punished all your former enemies. Now these officers,comparing their achievements,think you have not land enough to give fiefs to all.They fear you may not ennoble them, or may even punish them for past shortcomings.That is why they are gathering together to plot revolt.” The emperor was disturbed and asked,“What shall I do?” “Is there any man they all know you abominate?” "Yong Chi is one of my old confederates,but he keeps plaguing and insulting me.If not for all he's done,I'd kill him.” “Then lose no time in giving Yong Chi a fief.When the others see him enfeoffed,they will rest assured.” So the emperor gave a feast at which he made Yong Chi marquis of Shifang and ordered the prime minister and chief counsellor to decide on the other fiefs.After this feast the officers were pleased and said,"If even Yong Chi is made a marquis,we need have no worry."

刘敬说高帝曰“都关中”。上疑之。左右大臣皆山东人，多劝上都雒阳:“雒阳东有成皋，西有崤、黾，倍河，向伊、雒,其固亦足恃。”留侯曰：“雒阳虽有此固，其中小,不过数百里，田地薄，四面受敌，此非用武之国也。夫关中左崤、函,右陇、蜀,沃野千里，南有巴蜀之饶,北有胡苑之利,阻三面而守,独以一面东制诸侯。诸侯安定，河、渭漕挽天下,西给京师；诸侯有变，顺流而下，足以委输。此所谓金城千里，天府之国也,刘敬说是也。”于是高帝即日驾，西都关中。
刘敬劝刘邦说：“国都应该设在关中。”刘邦听了迟疑不决。刘邦的大臣们都是崤山以东的人，他们大都劝刘邦建都洛阳。他们说：“洛阳东有成皋，西有崤山和渑水，背靠黄河，面对伊、洛二川，形势险要，可以让人放心。”张良说：“洛阳固然有它险要的一面，但是它方圆才不过几百里，而且土地瘠薄，四面都容易受到敌人的攻击，这不是一个可以发挥军事优势的地方。关中就不同了，它左有崤山和函谷关，右有陇山与岷山，中间沃野千里。它南面连着物产丰富的巴、蜀，北面挨着盛产牛马的胡地，我们背靠着万无一失的南、北、西三面，集中力量只用于控制东方的诸侯。东方安定的时候，可以通过黄河、渭水把全国各地的粮食运到长安；一旦有诸侯叛乱，关中的人力物力可以通过渭水、黄河顺流而下供给前线。这就是人们通常所说的‘金城千里，天府之国’。刘敬的说法是对的。”于是刘邦当天就坐着车子西行建都关中了。
Liu Jing advised the emperor to make his capital within the Pass. The emperor was in two minds about this.As most of his attendants and high ministers came from east of the mountains,they urged him to make Luoyang the capital.“East of Louyang there is Chenggao,west Mount Yao and the River Min,"they said."With the Yellow River behind and the Yiand Luo Rivers before,it is surely impregnable!” ButZhang Liang objected,"Though Luoyang has these advantages, it covers no more than a few hundred li,the land is not fertile and the city is open to attack on four sides.It is not strategically situated.Within the Pass,however,we have Mount Yao and the Hangu Pass to the east, the Long and Shu ranges to the west,and a thousand li of fertile field; while to the south is the wealth of Ba and Shu,to the north the advan- tage of the Hunnish pastures.With natural barriers on three sides,we need only cope with the barons in the east.So long as they are quiet, ships can sail along the Yellow River and the Wei to all parts of the empire to bring back grain to the capital in the west.And if the barons make trouble,we can sail downstream with supplies and reinforcement. This is truly a mighty stronghold of solid gold,a thousand-li wall of bronze,a natural treasure-house!Liu Jing is right.”That same day the empeor drove west in his carriage to make his capital within the Pass.

留侯从入关。留侯性多病，即道引不食谷，杜门不出岁余。
张良也跟着刘邦进了关中。张良一直多病，到了关中以后，就整天学习道家的导引吐纳之术，不吃五谷杂粮，几乎有一年多闭门不出。
ZhangLiang accompanied him. As his health was poor,Zhang Liang practised breath control and ate no grain,not venturing out of his house for a year and more.

上欲废太子，立戚夫人子赵王如意。大臣多谏争，未能得坚决者也。吕后恐，不知所为。人或谓吕后曰：“留侯善画计策，上信用之。”吕后乃使建成侯吕释之劫留侯,曰：“君常为上谋臣,今上欲易太子，君安得高枕而卧乎?”留侯曰：“始上数在困急之中，幸用臣策。今天下安定，以爱欲易太子，骨肉之间，虽臣等百余人何益。”吕释之强要曰：“为我画计。”留侯曰：“此难以口舌争也。顾上有不能致者,天下有四人。四人者年老矣，皆以为上慢侮人，故逃匿山中，义不为汉臣。然上高此四人。今公诚能无爱金玉璧帛，令太子为书，卑辞安车,因使辩士固请，宜来。来，以为客，时时从入朝,令上见之，则必异而问之。问之，上知此四人贤，则一助也。”于是吕后令吕释之使人奉太子书，卑辞厚礼，迎此四人。四人至，客建成侯所。
后来，刘邦想废掉太子刘盈，另立戚夫人所生的儿子赵王如意。很多大臣劝阻，但都始终没能彻底改变刘邦的态度。吕后很害怕，不知如何是好。这时有人提醒吕后说：“留侯张良善于出谋划策，皇上一贯信任他。”于是吕后就派建成侯吕释之去胁迫张良说：“您曾为皇上出谋划策，现在皇上想要更换太子，您怎么能躺在屋里睡大觉不闻不问?”张良说：“当初皇上曾多次处于危急之中，所以他能采纳我的意见；现在天下已经安定了，他是出于个人的感情，想换太子，这是人家家庭内部的事情，对于这种事情，即使有一百个张良也没有用。”吕释之强逼着说：“无论如何您必须给想个办法。”张良说：“这种事，空口劝说是不行的。皇上有四个一直想请而至今请不到的人，这四个人年纪都大了，他们讨厌皇上的傲慢无礼，宁愿逃到深山里躲起来，也不愿做汉朝的子民。但是皇上还一直对这四个人很崇敬。现在您如果能够不吝惜金银财宝，多多地带着礼物，让太子写上一封信，言词要谦恭，安排好舒适的车子，派一个会说话的人去请他们，我估计他们是会来的。如果来了，叫他们充当太子的宾客，经常跟随太子上朝，故意让皇上看到他们。这样皇上感到奇怪，就会问他们。一问是他们，皇上知道他们德高望重，这对太子将是一种很大的帮助。”于是吕后就让吕释之派人带着厚礼和太子的书信，谦恭地去请这四个人。四人请来后，先住在建成侯吕释之的家里。
The emperor wished to depose the crown prince in favour of Prince Ruyi of Zhao,his son by Lady Qi;but because many of his chief ministers objected,he had not reached a final decision.Empress Lü was alarmed and did not know what to do till someone suggested, “The marquis of Liu is a shrewd schemer and the emperor trusts him." Accordingly Empress Lü sent Lü Ze,marquis of Jiancheng,to enlist ZhangLiang's help saying,"You have always advised the emperor. Now that he wants to disinherit the crown prince,how can you lie easy on your pillow?“” "When the emperor was in difficulties he used several of my plans," replied Zhang Liang."Now the empire is at peace and,if he wants to substitute his favourite son for the crown prince,this is between his own flesh and blood.A hundred or more ministers like myself can do nothing.” But Lü Ze insisted,"Think of some plan for us!" "Hard to talk him out of this,"was Zhang Liang's answer.“But there are four men the emperor has failed to win ovet.These four men are old and,because they think his manner insulting,they have hidden themselves in the hills and refuse to serve the House of Han.The em- peror has a high regard for these men.Now if you spare no expense on gold and rich gifts,get the crown prince to write a letter couched in humble terms,send comfortable carriages for them and an eloquent speaker to press the invitation,it is possible they may come.If they do, you can entertain them as guests,taking them from time to time with you to the palace,where the emperor will notice them,wonder who they are and make inquiries.When he learns that they are these four worthies,that should help your case.”Then Empress Lümade LüZe send a messenger with the crown prince's letter,inviting these four men with humble words and rich gifts.Upon their arrival,LüZe made them his guests.

汉十一年，黥布反,上病，欲使太子将，往击之。四人相谓曰：“凡来者，将以存太子。太子将兵，事危矣。”乃说建成侯曰：“太子将兵，有功则位不益太子；无功还，则从此受祸矣。且太子所与俱诸将，皆尝与上定天下枭将也,今使太子将之，此无异使羊将狼也，皆不肯为尽力，其无功必矣。臣闻‘母爱者子抱’,今戚夫人日夜侍御,赵王如意常抱居前，上曰‘终不使不肖子居爱子之上’,明乎其代太子位必矣。君何不急请吕后承间为上泣言:‘黥布，天下猛将也，善用兵，今诸将皆陛下故等夷,乃令太子将此属，无异使羊将狼，莫肯为用，且使布闻之，则鼓行而西耳。上虽病，强载辎车，卧而护之”,诸将不敢不尽力。上虽苦，为妻子自强。'”于是吕泽立夜见吕后，吕后承间为上泣涕而言，如四人意。上曰：“吾惟竖子固不足遣，而公自行耳。”于是上自将兵而东，群臣居守，皆送至灞上。留侯病，自强起，至曲邮，见上曰：“臣宜从，病甚。楚人剽疾，愿上无与楚人争锋。”因说上曰：“令太子为将军，监关中兵。”上曰：“子房虽病，强卧而傅太子。”是时叔孙通为太傅，留侯行少傅事。
汉高祖十一年，黥布起兵造反，刘邦当时有病，想让太子率兵前去征讨。四个人彼此商量道：“我们之所以到这里来，就是为了保护太子。如果今天让太子领兵出征，那事情就很危险了。”于是四人去找吕释之说：“太子领兵出征，即使有了功劳，也不会给太子带来什么好处；假如无功而回，那就要从此遭殃了。而且太子所统领的那些将领，都是过去同皇上一道打天下的猛将。现在让太子去统领他们，这简直就是让一只羊去统领一群狼，谁也不会替太子尽力，这样去了是绝对不会获得成功的。俗话说：‘爱哪个母亲，就抱哪个母亲所生的孩子。’现在戚夫人整天围着皇上转，赵王如意常常被抱放在皇帝面前，皇上常说‘我无论如何不会让那不成器的小子坐在我这个心爱的儿子的上头’,很明显赵王如意要取代太子是肯定无疑的。你为什么还不赶快请吕后找机会向皇上哭诉，就说：‘黥布是天下有名的将领，很会用兵，而咱们的这些将领，又都和您是同一辈的。如果让太子去统领他们，简直就是让羊去统领狼，没有人会听他使唤。这要叫黥布一知道，那他就会毫无顾忌地向西长驱直入了。您现在虽然有病，但最好还是坚持一下，即使躺在一辆篷车里不动，只要您在，他们就谁也不敢不尽力。您虽然吃些苦，为了老婆孩子，就再硬撑一回吧。'”吕释之听罢，当夜就把四个人的意思告诉了吕后。吕后赶紧找机会按着四个人的意思对刘邦哭诉了一遍。刘邦一听说：“我也早就琢磨着这个小子不中用，还是老子自己去吧!”于是刘邦亲自率军东征了。留守京都的大臣们，都送行到霸上。张良正有病，但也挣扎着来到曲邮。张良对刘邦说：“我本来应随您一道去，但因病重不可能了。楚地人迅猛剽悍，希望您不要同黥布的军队正面硬拼。”并乘机又说：“应该任命太子为统帅，让他留守后方，监督节制关中的所有军队。”刘邦答应了，说：“您虽有病，也请您勉为其难替我照顾太子吧!”因为当时叔孙通已经是太傅，所以刘邦遂命张良代理少傅的职务。
In the eleventh year of Han,Ying Bu rebelled.The emperor,who was ill,wanted the crown prince to command the army sent against him.The four worthies said to each other,"We came here to preserve the crown prince.If he commands the army he will be endangered.” So they told Lü Ze,"If the crown prince commands the army and is successful that will not improve his position,while if he returns unsuc- cessful that will be disastrous.Besides,all the generals under him will be redoubtable veterans who helped his father to win the empire.The crown prince at their head will be like a lamb commanding a pack of wolves.As they will not fight well for him,his failure is certain.” "We have heard that whoever loves the mother will fondle her child.Now Lady Qiwaits on the emperor day and night so that Prince Ruyi is always dandled before him,and the emperor has declared that no unworthy son shall ever rule over a son whom he loves.It is obvi- ous that he is going to replace the crown prince.Lose no time,then,in urging Empress Lü to find some chance to plead to the emperor with tears.She can say that Ying Bu is a formidable fighter,a briliant com- mander known throughout the world.Since our generals are all the emperor’s old comrades-in-arms,setting the crown prince at their head would be like setting a lamb at the head of wolves —they would never obey him.And once Ying Bu knew this,he would march west towards the capital to the roll of drums.Although the emperor is unwell,he should make the effort to lead this campaign and direct his troops from a carriage,for then his generals will not dare to shirk. Hard as it is,the emperor should do this for the sake of his wife and child.” Lü Ze went that same night to see the empress,who did as the four worthies suggested,seizing an opportunity to plead to the em- peror with tears in her eyes. "I suppose the boy is not up to said the emperor."Your old man will have to go!”So he led his army eastwards.The ministers left in charge saw him off at Bashang.Although Zhang Liang was ill,he forced himself to get up and see the emperor at Quyou. "I should have accompanied you,"he said,"but I am too ill.The men of Chu are swift.Don't risk a head-on clash.”He persuaded the emperor to give the crown prince the command of the troops within the Pass. “Although you are ill,"said the emperor,"do your best to help the crown prince from your couch.”At this time Shusun Tong was the prince's senior guardian,so Zhang Liang acted as the junior guardian.

汉十二年，上从击破布军归，疾益甚，愈欲易太子。留侯谏，不听，因疾不视事。叔孙太傅称说引古今，以死争太子。上详许之,犹欲易之。及燕,置酒，太子侍。四人从太子，年皆八十有余，须眉皓白，衣冠甚伟。上怪之，问曰：“彼何为者?”四人前对，各言名姓，曰东园公、角里先生、绮里季、夏黄公。上乃大惊，曰：“吾求公数岁，公辟逃我,今公何自从吾儿游乎?”四人皆曰：“陛下轻士善骂，臣等义不受辱，故恐而亡匿。窃闻太子为人仁孝，恭敬爱士，天下莫不延颈欲为太子死者，故臣等来耳。”上曰：“烦公幸卒调护太子。”
汉高祖十二年，刘邦打败黥布从前线回来后，病情越来越重了，想更换太子的心情也越来越急迫了。张良劝说无效，遂推说有病，不问政事。叔孙通在刘邦面前称古道今地引证了许多历史教训，甚至要用最后一死来劝阻刘邦。刘邦假意答应，而心里仍是想要换太子。这时正好宫廷里有宴会，酒席已经排开，太子在一旁侍候，而四位老人便跟随在太子身后。四个人的年纪都在八十开外，须发皆白，衣帽伟丽。刘邦觉得奇怪，便问太子：“他们几个是什么人?”于是四个人过去各报自己的姓名，是：东园公、角里先生、绮里季、夏黄公。刘邦一听大吃一惊，说：“我找你们好几年，你们老是避而不见，今天你们为什么来和我儿子交往呢?"四人说：“您生性傲慢动不动就骂人，我们决不受您的侮辱，所以离开您远远的。后来我们听说皇太子忠孝仁慈，礼贤下士，普天下没有一个人不愿意为他效死，所以我们就来了。”刘邦说：“那就多劳你们，请你们始终如一地照护他吧。”
In the twelfth year of Han the emperor returned after defeating Ying Bu.His illness had grown worse and he was more determined than ever to depose the crown prince.When Zhang Liang's advice against this was disregarded,he retired on the pretext of illness.The senior guardian Shusun Tong,quoting precedents ancient and modern, put up such a hard fight for the crown prince that the emperor pre- tended to agree,though he still meant to change his heir. One day there was a feast and wine was served.The crown prince came to wait on his father,attended by four old men each over eighty. Their beards and eyebrows were white,their hats and gowns most imposing. The emperor asked in surprise,"Who are these men?" Then the four advanced and gave their names as Master Dongyuan, Scholar Luli,Qili Ji and Master Xiahuang. The emperor exclaimed in astonishment,"I tried for several years to get hold of you,yet you always kept away.What are you doing with my son?" The four men replied,"You insult gentlemen,sir,and are addicted to swearing.Unwilling to put up with humiliation,we ran away in fear. Then we heard that the crown prince was kind,pious and courteous to all,and that the people of the empire are ready to die for him,and so we came." The emperor said,"Take good care of the crown prince!"

四人为寿已毕，趋去。上目送之，召戚夫人指示四人者曰:“我欲易之，彼四人辅之，羽翼已成，难动矣。吕后真而主矣。”戚夫人泣，上曰：“为我楚舞，吾为若楚歌。”歌曰：“鸿鹄高飞，一举千里。羽翮已就，横绝四海。横绝四海，当可奈何!虽有赠缴，尚安所施!”歌数阕，戚夫人嘘唏流涕。上起去，罢酒。竟不易太子者，留侯本招此四人之力也。
于是四个人一齐向刘邦敬酒，而后一齐退去。刘邦望着他们，指着他们退去的身影对戚夫人说：“我想换掉太子，可是那四个人保护他，他的翅膀已经长成，不能再动了。看来吕后真是你的主子!”戚夫人听着不由得泪如雨下。刘邦又说：“你为我跳个楚地的风俗舞吧，我来伴你唱楚歌。”说罢刘邦唱道：“鸿鹄展翅高飞，一飞横空千里。翅膀已经长硬，任凭东西南北。任凭东西南北，谁能对它奈何!纵有强弓硬弩，也将徒劳无益!”他反复地唱了好几遍。戚夫人抽抽噎噎，涕泪横流。于是刘邦快快地离席而去，宴会就此结束。刘邦之所以最终没能废掉太子，就是由于张良出主意，请来了这四个人的结果。
After the four had paid their respects they rose to leave,and the emperor watched them go.He called Lady Qi and pointed them out to her,saying,"I meant to depose the crown prince,but these four men have come to his aid.His feathers are grown,it would be hard to dislodge him.Empress Lü is going to be your mistress now." Iady Qi shed tears,at which the emperor said,"Dance one of the dances of Chu for me,and I shall sing a song of Chu for you."With that he sang: High flies the wild swan, Soaring a thousand li; His feathers grown, He sweeps freely across the four seas; Sweeps freely across the four seas, And what can we do? Even our stringed shafts Are powerless against him. He sang this several times while Lady Qiwept and sobbed.Then he rose and left the feast.So thanks to these four men invited at the suggestion of Zhang Liang,the crown prince retained his position.

留侯从上击代,出奇计马邑下,及立萧何相国,所与上从容言天下事甚众,非天下所以存亡，故不著。留侯乃称曰：“家世相韩，及韩灭，不爱万金之资，为韩报仇强秦，天下振动。今以三寸舌为帝者师,封万户，位列侯，此布衣之极，于良足矣。愿弃人间事，欲从赤松子游耳。”乃学辟谷，道引轻身。会高帝崩，吕后德留侯，乃强食之,曰：“人生一世间，如白驹过隙，何至自苦如此乎!”留侯不得已，强听而食。
后来张良又跟随刘邦去讨伐代国，在马邑为刘邦出过奇计。后来刘邦任萧何当相国，也是听从张良劝告的结果。此外他与刘邦谈过的事情还有很多，但那些不是关系国家存亡的根本问题，所以这里就不一一记述了。张良自己说：“我们家世世代代在韩国当丞相，韩国被灭亡后，我为了替韩国向秦朝报仇，曾不吝惜万贯家财，闹得天下震动。现在我靠着三寸不烂之舌，当了帝王的老师，被封为万户侯。作为一个平民来说，这已经到达顶点，我的愿望已经满足了!我愿意抛弃人世间的一切事情，想跟着赤松子去当神仙。”于是他就学着不吃粮食，意想平地飞升。等到刘邦死后，吕后回想从前，感激张良的恩德，就去强迫他吃东西，并劝他说：“人活在世上，就像白马驰过墙缝一样短暂，为什么要这样自讨苦吃呢!”张良不得已，又勉强恢复了吃饭。
Zhang Liang accompanied the emperor on his expedition against Chen Xi in Dai,he devised the stratagem at Mayi,and it was he who urged that Xiao He be made prime minister.In his leisure he advised the emperor on various matters,but since these were not vital affairs of state they need not be recorded. Then Zhang Liang announced,"My forefathers were ministers of the state of Han (403B.C.-230B.C.)and after the state was overthrown I gave up a fortune to avenge Han against mighty Qin,causing a great stir in the world.With my ready tongue I became the adviser of an emperor,was given a fief of ten thousand households and made a marquis.This is all a common citizen could desire,andI am satisfied. Now Imean to turn my back on worldly affairs and follow the Master of the Red Pine."He abstained from grain and studied breath control so that he might fly through the air. When the emperor died, Empress Lü was so grateful to Zhang Liang that she insisted on his taking nourishment and said,“A man's life passes as swiftly as a white charger seen through a crack in the door. Why should you mortify yourself in this way?"So Zhang Liang had to take food.

后八年卒,谥为文成侯。子不疑代侯。
又过了八年，张良死了，朝廷谥之为“文成侯”。他的儿子张不疑继承了留侯的爵位。
Eight years later he died and was given the posthumous title of Marquis of Wencheng.His son Buyi succeeded to his title.

子房始所见下邳圯上老父与太公书者，后十三年从高帝过济北，果见谷城山下黄石，取而葆祠之。留侯死，并葬黄石。每上冢伏腊，祠黄石。
当初，张良在下邳桥头遇到的送给他《太公兵法》的那位老人，十三年以后，张良跟着刘邦经过济北，果然在谷城山下见到了一块黄石头。张良就把它带回珍重地供了起来。后来张良死时，人们就把这块黄石头同他埋在了一起。每逢夏、冬两季人们给张良扫墓时，同时也祭祀那块黄石头。
As for the old man who met him on the bridge Xiapi and gave him The Patriarch Lü Shang's Art of War,when Zhang Liang went north of the Ji River with the emperor thirteen years after their meeting,he found a yellow stone at the foot of Mount Gucheng which he took away and worshipped.After his death this stone was buried with him, and during the summer and winter sacrifices men sacrificed to the stone too.

留侯不疑，孝文帝五年坐不敬，国除。
留侯张不疑在孝文帝五年因犯了不敬朝廷的罪，封爵被废除。
In the fifth year of Emperor Wen,Zhang Liang's son Buyi was charged with impiety and deprived of his fief.

太史公曰：学者多言无鬼神，然言有物。至如留侯所见老父予书，亦可怪矣。高祖离困者数矣,而留侯常有功力焉，岂可谓非天乎?上曰：“夫运筹策帷帐之中，决胜千里外，吾不如子房。”余以为其人计魁梧奇伟,至见其图，状貌如妇人好女。盖孔子曰：“以貌取人，失之子羽。”留侯亦云。
太史公说：学者们都不相信鬼神，但却认为有物怪。至于像张良所见到的那位给他书的老人，也可以说是一怪了。汉高祖曾多次陷入困境，而张良常常能使他转危为安，这能够说不是一种天意吗?汉高祖曾佩服地说：“运筹于军帐之中，决胜于千里之外，我不如张良。”也正因此我总认为张良一定是一个身材魁梧、相貌非凡的人。等到后来一见他的画像，原来长得像个柔弱的妇女。孔子曾说过：“单以容貌取人，我就看错过澹台子羽。"对于张良，我也差点犯了同样的错误。
The Grand Historian comments:Most scholars deny the existence of ghosts and spirits,but admit that marvels take place.The story of Zhang Liang's meeting with the old man who gave him the book is certainly a strange one.It was surely the will of Heaven that Zhang Liang was so often able to save the first emperor of Han(206B.C.-8A. D.)when he was in trouble.The emperor said,"When it comes to scheming in the commander's tent to win a battle a thousand li away,I am no match for Zhang Liang."So I had always visualized him as a tall,imposing figure,yet when I saw his portrait he looked like a woman or a pretty girl.Confucius said,"“Judging by appearances I have been mistaken in the case of Ziyu."The same might be said of Zhang Liang.
