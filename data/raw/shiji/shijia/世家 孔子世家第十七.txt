孔子生鲁昌平乡陬邑。其先宋人也,曰孔防叔。防叔生伯夏，伯夏生叔梁纥。纥与颜氏女野合而生孔子，祷于尼丘得孔子。鲁襄公二十二年而孔子生。生而首上圩顶,故因名曰“丘”云。字仲尼,姓孔氏。
孔子生在鲁国昌平乡的陬邑。他的祖先是宋国人，他的曾祖父叫孔防叔。孔防叔的儿子叫伯夏，伯夏的儿子叫叔梁纥。叔梁纥与颜家的一个女子私通生了孔子。据说他们曾往尼丘山做过祷告。所以在鲁襄公二十二年孔子降生后脑袋就长得中间低四面高，因此他的母亲给他取名叫丘，字仲尼，姓孔。
Confucius was born in Zou,a village in the district of Changping in the state of Lu.His ancestors came from Song and one of them, Kong Fangshu,had a son named Boxia,whose son was Shulianghe.In his old age Shulianghe took a daughter of the Yan family,and after he had prayed at the shrine of Niqiu she gave birth to Confucius.That was in the twenty-second year of Duke Xiang of Lu.Because he was born with a hollow in the top of his head,he was given the personal name of Qiu,with the courtesy name Zhongni and the surname Kong.

丘生而叔梁纥死,葬于防山。防山在鲁东，由是孔子疑其父墓处，母讳之也。孔子为儿嬉戏，常陈俎豆，设礼容。孔子母死，乃殡五父之衢，盖其慎也。陬人貌父之母诲孔子父墓,然后往合葬于防焉。
孔丘降生不久叔梁纥就死了，叔梁纥死后埋在防山，防山处在鲁国的东面。但是孔子始终不知道他父亲埋在什么地方，因为他的母亲故意不告诉他。当孔子还是一个孩子与小伙伴们做游戏的时候，就爱把玩具当做祭器摆设起来，模仿大人祭祀的样子。后来孔子的母亲死了，孔子就把她的灵柩停放在五父之衢，没有正式埋葬，大概就是因为还没有找到父亲的墓地而谨慎等待的缘故吧。陬邑人貌父的母亲告诉了孔子他父亲坟地的地点，而后孔子才把他母亲的灵柩送到了防山与他的父亲一起合葬了。
Soon after his birth Shulianghe died and was buried at Mount Fang in the east of Lu.Later Confucius suspected that his father’s grave was there,but his mother hid the truth from him.As a child,Confucius liked to play with sacrificial vessels,setting them out as if for a ceremony. After his mother's death,as a precaution,he had her coffin entombed in Wufu Lane.Then the mother of Wan Fuof Zou told him the where- abouts of his father's grave,and he had his mother buried with her husband at Mount Fang.

孔子要绖,季氏飨士,孔子与往。阳虎绌曰:“季氏飨士，非敢飨子也。”孔子由是退。
孔子的腰里正系着白带子给他的母亲守孝，这时正巧大贵族季孙氏的家里请客，于是孔子也去了。到了季孙氏门口，季孙氏的管家阳虎挡住孔子说：“季孙氏家所宴请的是士卒，没有请您。”孔子于是退了回来。
Confucius was still wearing the belt of mourning when he went to a feast for gentlemen given by the Ji clan.Yang Hu turned him away, saying,"TheJi clan is entertaininggentlemen:you are not included."At that Confucius withdrew.

孔子年十七,鲁大夫孟螫子病且死,诫其嗣懿子曰:“孔丘，圣人之后,灭于宋。其祖弗父何始有宋而嗣让厉公。及正考父佐戴、武、宣公,三命兹益恭,故鼎铭云:‘一命而偻，再命而伛，三命而俯，循墙而走,亦莫敢余侮。馆于是，粥于是，以糊余口。”其恭如是。吾闻圣人之后，虽不当世，必有达者。今孔丘年少好礼，其达者欤?吾即没，若必师之。”
孔子十七岁的时候，鲁国的大夫孟鳌子病重，临死前告诚他的儿子孟懿子说：“孔丘是圣人的后代，他的先祖在宋国受害所以后代才到鲁国来。孔子的九世祖弗父何本来应该享有宋国而他却让给了宋厉公。弗父何的曾孙正考父先后辅佐过宋戴公、宋武公、宋宣公三代，曾受过三次晋封的任命，而他的表现却是地位越高为人越谦逊。因此在他家的一个鼎上刻的铭文说：‘第一次听到任命我低着头，第二次听到任命我弯着腰垂着袖，第三次听到任命我弓着身子，顺着墙根走，到头来也没有人给我气受。我每天一碗稀饭一碗粥，就凭着这个糊口。'他的谦恭就是这个样子。我听说凡是圣人的后代，即使当不了大官，也一定会成为名人。现在孔丘从小就喜好礼仪，说不定他就是那个该出现的名人吧?我就要死了，你一定要去拜他为师。”
When Confucius was seventeen,Meng Xizi the minister ofLu fell ill and as he was dying he told his successor Yizi,“Kong Qiu is de- scended from sages.One of his ancestors was killed in Song.One of his ancestors,Fufuhe,should have been the ruler of Song but made over the state to his younger brother Duke Li.And Zheng Kaofu,his great-grandson who served Duke Dai,Duke Wu and Duke Xuan, behaved more modestly after each appointment.Thus his tripod in- scription reads:'At the first appointment I inclined my head,at the second I bowed,at the third I bent low.I hug the wall and no one dares insult me.Pap and gruel stay my hunger.'See how unassuming he was!I have heard that even if he does not hold office the descendant of sages is always a wise man.Kong Qiu is young,but he sets such store on the rites that I am sure he is a man of understanding.When I am gone,make him your teacher."

及鳌子卒，懿子与鲁人南宫敬叔往学礼焉。是岁,季武子卒，平子代立。
等到孟鳌子死后，孟懿子果然就和另一个鲁国人南宫敬叔一道去向孔子学礼了。也就在这一年，鲁国贵族季孙氏家的季武子死了，季平子代立为卿。
So after Meng Xizi's death,Yizi and Nangong Jingshu,another native of Lu,studied the rites with Confucius.That same year Ji Wuzi died and Pingzi succeeded him.

孔子贫且贱。及长，尝为季氏史，料量平；尝为司职吏而畜蕃 息。由是为司空。已而去鲁，斥乎齐，逐乎宋、卫，困于陈蔡之间，于是反鲁。孔子长九尺有六寸，人皆谓之“长人”而异之。鲁复善待，由是反鲁。
孔子贫穷而且地位低下。等到他长大后，曾经作过季氏的小 吏，管理仓库，出入的东西都称量得很公平；曾经做过管理畜牧 的官吏，养的牲畜肥壮繁多。孔子由此作了司空。后来他离开鲁 国，到了齐国遭到排斥，又受到宋国、卫国的驱逐，被困在陈国 和蔡国之间，于是又返回了鲁国。孔子身高九尺六寸，人们都叫 他“长人”,认为他很奇异。鲁国又很好地对待他，从此他就返回鲁国。
Confucius was poor and humble.Growing up and working as keeper of the granaries for the Ji clan he measured the grain fairly; when he was keeper of the livestock the animals flourished;and so he was made minister of works.Subsequently he left Lu,was dismissed from Qi,driven out of Song and Wei(1024B.C.-209B.C.)and ran into trouble between Chen and Cai.Finally he returned to Lu.Well over six feet,Confucius was called the Tall Man and every- body marvelled at his height.He returned to the state of Lu as it had treated him well.

鲁南宫敬叔言鲁君曰:“请与孔子适周。”鲁君与之一乘车,两马，一竖子俱,适周问礼，盖见老子云。
这时南宫敬叔对鲁君说：“请让我和孔子一同到周国去。”鲁君答应了，于是给了他们一乘车，两匹马，和一个仆人。他们一同到了周国学习礼仪，据说还在那里见过老子。
Nangong Jingshu asked the duke of Lu to let him accompany Confucius to Zhou,and the duke gave them a carriage,a pair of horses and a page boy.They went to Zhou to study rites and there met Lao Zi.

辞去，而老子送之曰：“吾闻富贵者送人以财，仁人者送人以言。吾不能富贵，窃仁人之号,送子以言,曰：‘聪明深察而近于死者,好议人者也。博辩广大危其身者，发人之恶者也。为人子者毋以有己,为人臣者毋以有己。'”孔子自周反于鲁，弟子稍益进焉。
等到他们离周回国时，老子给孔子送行说：“富贵的人临别送钱财，仁人临别则是送上几句话。我不是富贵的人，却叨居了一个‘仁人’的称号，那我就送给您几句话吧。这就是：‘聪明而见识深刻的人之所以反而容易自寻死路，是因为他们爱议论别人。学识渊博能言善辩的人之所以容易给自身带来危险，是因为他们好揭露别人的丑恶。做儿子的在父母面前不要显示自己的存在，做臣子的在国君面前也不要显示自己的存在。”孔子从周国回到鲁国后，学生们就一天比一天多起来了。
When Confucius was leaving,Lao Zi's parting words to him were, "I have heard that the rich and great offer farewellgifts of money while the good offer advice.I am neither rich nor great but,unworthy as I am,have been called good;so let me offer you a few words of advice.”Then he said,“A shrewd observer,prone to criticize others, risks his own life.A learned man who exposes the faults of others endangers himself.A filial son must never thrust himself forward,and neither may a good subject.”On his return from Zhou to Lu,Confucius began to gather more disciples.

是时也，晋平公淫,六卿擅权,东伐诸侯；楚灵王兵强,陵铄中国;齐大而近于鲁。鲁小弱，附于楚则晋怒；附于晋则楚来伐；不备于齐，齐师侵鲁。
这时候，晋平公荒淫无道，晋国的政权落在了六个大贵族手里，他们经常出兵进攻东方的诸侯国；在南方是楚灵王强大，经常出兵侵陵中原各国；在东方则是齐国强大而又离鲁国近。鲁国既小且弱，如果他归附楚国则晋国就要发怒；如果他靠拢晋国则楚国就要来打；如果对齐国侍候得稍微不周到，则齐国也要来进攻。
Now the situation at this time was that Duke Ping of Jin was a dissolute man whose six ministers held the reins of government and were attacking other states in the east,King Ling of Chu was harrying the central states with his powerful armies,and mighty Qi bordered on Lu.Lu was small and weak.If she attached herself to Chu,this would offend Jin;while if she allied with Jin,Chu would attack her;if she took no defensive measures,the men of Qi would invade her.

鲁昭公之二十年,而孔子盖年三十矣。齐景公与晏婴来适鲁,景公问孔子曰：“昔秦穆公国小处辟,其霸何也?”对曰：“秦，国虽小，其志大；处虽辟，行中正。身举五羖,爵之大夫，起累绁之中,与语三日，授之以政。以此取之,虽王可也，其霸小矣。”景公说。
鲁昭公二十年，孔子已经三十岁了。这一年齐景公和晏婴到鲁国来了。齐景公问孔子说：“过去秦穆公时秦国的国土又小，地势又偏僻，他怎么能够称了霸呢?”孔子说：“秦国的地盘虽小，可是他的国君志向远大；他的地势虽然偏僻，但国君的行为却中正无私。他把五羖大夫百里奚从一个被捆绑的奴隶提拔起来封他为大夫，接着又和他谈了三天话，而后就毫不迟疑地把国家大政交给了他。就从这点说即使称王也完全应该，称霸还委屈了他呢。”景公听了很高兴。
In the twentieth year of Duke Zhao of Lu,Confucius reached the age of thirty.Duke Jing of Qi and Yan Ying visited Lu and the duke said to Confucius,"Duke Mu of Qin had only a small,outlying state, yet he became a great conqueror.How was that?” Confucius replied,"Though Qin was small it aspired to great things. Though outlying,its conduct was correct.With five sheepskins the duke freed a slave from bondage and gave him the rank of a minister.After talking with him for three days he entrusted the affairs of state to him. Judging by this he was worthy to be a king—being a conqueror was not good enough for him.” The duke was pleased with this reply.

孔子年三十五,而季平子与廊昭伯以斗鸡故得罪鲁昭公,昭公率师击平子，平子与孟氏、叔孙氏三家共攻昭公,昭公师败，奔于齐，齐处昭公乾侯。其后顷之,鲁乱。孔子适齐，为高昭子家臣,欲以通乎景公。与齐太师语乐,闻《韶》音,学之，三月不知肉味,齐人称之。
在孔子三十五岁那年，季平子和邸昭伯因为斗鸡赌输赢的事情冒犯了鲁昭公，鲁昭公率军攻打季平子，而季平子与孟孙氏、叔孙氏三家联合起来一道反击鲁昭公，鲁昭公被打败，逃到了齐国，齐国让鲁昭公住在了乾侯。此后不久，鲁国又发生内乱，于是孔子就离开鲁国到齐国去了。他在齐国给高昭子当家臣，想通过高昭子见到齐景公。孔子曾和齐国的太师谈论乐理，当他在那里听到了虞舜时的《韶》乐时，就入迷地学起来，其专心致志的程度据说是一连三个月连肉味都吃不出来了，这件事大大博得了齐国人的赞赏。
When Confucius was thirty-five,Ji Pingzi,because of a cockfight between a bird of his and one owned by Hou Zhaobo,offended Duke Zhao of Lu.The duke led troops against him.Ji Pingzi fought back with the support of the houses of Mengsun and Shusun and defeated the duke,who fled to Qi where he settled at Ganhou.After this there was such confusion in Lu that Confucius went to Qi to serve as Gao Zhaozi's steward in the hope of getting an introduction to Duke Jing.He discussed music with the chief musician of Qi,heard the Shao Music and studied it,and for three months did not know the taste of meat.The men of Qi thought highly of him.

景公问政孔子,孔子曰：“君君，臣臣，父父，子子。”景公曰：“善哉!信如君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子，虽有粟，吾岂得而食诸!”他日又复问政于孔子，孔子曰：“政在节财。”景公说，将欲以尼溪田封孔子。晏婴进曰：“夫儒者滑稽而不可轨法;倨傲自顺,不可以为下；崇丧遂哀,破产厚葬，不可以为俗；游说乞贷,不可以为国。自大贤之息,周室既衰，礼乐缺有间。今孔子盛容饰，繁登降之礼、趋详之节,累世不能殚其学,当年不能究其礼。君欲用之以移齐俗，非所以先细民也。”后景公敬见孔子，不问其礼。异日，景公止孔子曰:“奉子以季氏，吾不能，以季孟之间待之。”
齐景公曾向孔子询问如何治理国家，孔子说：“做国君的要像个国君，做大臣的要像个大臣，做父亲的要像个父亲，做儿子的要像个儿子。”齐景公说：“讲得好呀!要是国君不像国君，大臣不像大臣，父亲不像父亲，儿子不像儿子，那么即使仓库里有的是粮食，恐怕我也吃不上了!”过了几天他又向孔子询问如何治理国家，孔子说：“要注意节省财力。”齐景公很高兴，想把尼溪的一块领地封给孔子。这时晏婴反对说：“他们这些儒家分子只会油腔滑调地瞎扯，而无法让人按着他们的说法做；他们行为傲慢自以为是，谁也使唤不了；他们特别讲究办丧事，甚至出一场殡不惜倾家荡产，这样的事情不能让它成为风俗；他们到处游说，求官求钱，这样的人不能让他们来治理国家。自从那些大贤人们去世之后，周王朝已经日益衰微，礼乐已经残缺很多年了。现在孔子却极其讲究穿戴服饰要合乎礼，在那里将登堂下室以及各种行动的礼节搞得特别繁琐。他搞的那些东西让人一辈子也学不好，多少年也学不透。您要是用他那套东西来改变齐国的风俗，首先您自己就没办法给百姓们起带头作用。”这以后，齐景公再见到孔子时，虽然还很有礼貌，但就绝不再向他问礼了。又过了一些天，齐景公挽留孔子说：“要想让我给您像季孙氏那样的待遇，我做不到，我给予您低于季孙氏而高于孟孙氏的待遇吧。”
Duke Jing of Qi questioned him about government.His answer was,"Let the prince be a prince,the minister a minister,the father a father and the son a son.” The duke rejoined,"Well said!For indeed when the prince is not a prince,the minister not a minister,the father not a father,the son nota son,even if there were grain I might be unable to eat it.” Another day he asked about government again and Confucius said, “The main thing is economy in the use of wealth.” The duke was pleased and would have given the field of Nixi to Confucius as his fief had not Yan Ying protested,"These Confucians are such unruly windbags,so arrogant and self-willed that there is no controlling them.They set great store by long mourning and bankrupt themselves for a sumptuous funeral;it would never do if this became the custom.A beggar who roams the land talking is not a man to entrust with affairs of state.Ever since the passing of the great sages and the decline of the Zhou Dynasty,the rites and music have fallen into decay.Now Confucius lays such stress on appearance and costume, elaborate etiquette and codes of behaviour that it would take genera- tions to learn his rules—one lifetime would not be enough!To adopt his way of reforming the state would not be putting the common people first.”So when next Duke Jing saw Confucius he did not question him about ceremony.And on another day he told him,"I cannot give you the rank of first minister."He treated him as someone between the first and third rank.

齐大夫欲害孔子,孔子闻之。景公曰：“吾老矣，弗能用也。”孔子遂行，反乎鲁。
后来齐国的大夫们嫉恨孔子，孔子听到了这种风声。而齐景公这时也对孔子说：“我已经老了，不能再任用您了。”于是孔子就离开了齐国，又回到了鲁国。
The other ministers of Qi conspired to injure Confucius,who learned of their plot.And Duke Jing said,"I am old, I cannot make use of your services."So Confucius left Qi and re- turned to Lu.

孔子年四十二,鲁昭公卒于乾侯,定公立。定公五年夏,季平子卒，桓子嗣立。季桓子穿井得土缶，中若羊,问仲尼云“得狗”。仲尼曰：“以丘所闻，羊也。丘闻之，木石之怪夔、罔阆,水之怪龙、罔象,土之怪坟羊。”
在孔子四十二岁那年，鲁昭公死在了齐国的乾侯，鲁定公在国内即位。鲁定公五年夏天，季平子死了，季桓子继位为卿。这时季桓子挖井时，挖出了个瓦罐，瓦罐中有个羊一般的小动物。他们到孔子那里说“我们挖到了一只狗”。孔子说：“依我的推测，应该是只羊。因为我听说，森林高山中的怪物叫夔、叫罔阆，水中的怪物叫龙、叫周象，而土里的怪物叫做坟羊。”
When Confucius was forty-two,Duke Zhao ofLu died at Ganhou and Duke Ding succeeded him.In the summer of the fifth year of Duke Ding,Ji Pingzi died and Ji Huanzi took his place as first minister. While sinking a well,Ji Huanzi found an earthenware pot with a crea- ture like a sheep inside it and,although aware of what it was,he told Confucius that it was a dog."From all I have heard,"said Confucius, “it must be a sheep.For kui and wangliang are the spirits of woods and rocks,those of the deep are dragons and wangxiang,while those of the earth are entombed sheep.”

吴伐越，堕会稽,得骨节专车。吴使使问仲尼：“骨何者最大?”仲尼曰：“禹致群神于会稽山,防风氏后至,禹杀而戮之,其节专车，此为大矣。”吴客曰：“谁为神?”仲尼曰：“山川之神足以纲纪天下，其守为神,社稷为公侯,皆属于王者。”客曰：“防风何守?”仲尼曰：“汪罔氏之君守封、禺之山,为鳌姓”。在虞、夏、商为汪罔，于周为长翟,今谓之大人。”客曰：“人长几何?”仲尼曰：“焦侥氏三尺，短之至也。长者不过十之，数之极也。”于是吴客曰：“善哉，圣人!”
后来吴国出兵伐越，在铲平会稽城的时候，得到有一辆车子那么长的一节骨头。吴王就派人来问孔子：“什么人的骨头最长?”孔子说：“当初夏禹召集天下各地的‘神’到会稽山开会，防风氏违命迟到了，夏禹就杀了他并把他的尸体摆出来示众，他的一节骨头就有一辆车子那么长，这应该算是最长的。”吴王的使臣又问：“‘神’是干什么的呢?”孔子说：“山川上的神灵能够主宰天下，而主管祭祀山川的诸侯就叫‘神’,如果只是祭祀社稷的那就叫做公侯，他们都是归属于天子的。”吴国人又问：“防风氏主管祭祀什么地方呢?”孔子说：“汪罔氏的君主主管祭祀的是封山和禺山，他们姓鳌。在虞舜、夏朝、商朝时称作汪罔氏，在周朝初年叫长翟，到了今天又称作大人。”吴国人问：“他们有多高呢?”孔子说：“焦侥氏高三尺，这是最矮的人。最高的人也不能超过十倍，顶多也就是三丈高了。”吴国人一听佩服地说：“好，果然是圣人!”
When Wu attacked Yue and captured Kuaiji,a skeleton was dis- covered that filled a whole chariot.The king of Wu sent an envoy to ask Confucius,"What has the largest bones?" Confucius replied,"When Yu summoned all the gods to Mount Kuaiji,Fangfeng arrived late and Yu killed him as a warning to others. His skeleton filled a whole chariot:that is the largest.” “What gods were those?”asked the envoy. “Gods of the hills and streams to regulate the world,gods who were local chiefs;and gods of earth and grain who became barons under the sovereign.” “Of what was Fangfeng in charge?” "He was lord of Wangwang of the Xi clan,ruling over Mounts Feng and Yu.In the time of King Shun and during the Xia and Shang Dynasties,the family was called Wangwang;in the Zhou Dynasty they were known as the giants of Di;today we just call them giants.” “What height can men reach?” "The Qiaoyao pygmies,three feet high,are the smallest.The tallest cannot be more than ten times their height:that is the upper limit.” Then the envoy of Wu commented,“Well spoken,sage!”

桓子嬖臣曰仲梁怀,与阳虎有隙。阳虎欲逐怀,公山不狃止之。其秋，怀益骄，阳虎执怀。桓子怒，阳虎因囚桓子，与盟而醒之。阳虎由此益轻季氏。季氏亦僭于公室,陪臣执国政,是以鲁自大夫以下皆僭离于正道。故孔子不仕，退而修《诗》、《书》、《礼》、《乐》,弟子弥众，至自远方，莫不受业焉。
季桓子有个宠臣叫仲梁怀，此人与季桓子的管家阳虎有矛盾。阳虎想赶走他，被季桓子的另一个家臣公山不狃劝阻了。到了这年秋天，仲梁怀变得更加盛气凌人，阳虎一怒之下把他扣了起来。季桓子对阳虎的专擅行为不满，于是阳虎又趁势把季桓子也扣了起来，强迫他订立了盟约，才释放了他。从此以后阳虎就越来越不把季桓子放在眼里了。而季桓子也不守本分，他的一切排场都和鲁国的诸侯相同，他作为一个陪臣却掌握着鲁国的大政，所以鲁国上自大夫，下至各层官吏通通不守本分不守礼节。正是由于这种状况孔子也就不想在鲁国当什么官了，于是他回到了家中，专门从事《诗》、《书》、《礼》、《乐》的整理工作，他的学生越来越多，有的是从很远的地方来的，接受他的教育。
Ji Huanzi's favourite minister,Zhongliang Huai,was an enemy of Yang Hu,who would have driven him away had not Gongshan Buniu dissuaded him.That autumn Zhongliang Huai behaved even more in- solently and Yang Hu had him arrested.Because Ji Huanzi was angry, Yang Hu imprisoned him too,releasing him after they had reached an agreement.This made Yang Hu despise the Ji clan more than ever. While the Ji clan usurped the duke's authority,their own servants had actual control of the state.In fact,all the men of Lu from the ministers down overstepped their rightful bounds and did not act correctly.This is why Confucius took no official post but edited the Book of Songs, Book of Documents,Book of Rites and Book of Music in retirement,and more and more pupils came even from distant places to study under him.

定公八年,公山不狃不得意于季氏，因阳虎为乱,欲废三桓之適,更立其庶孽阳虎素所善者,遂执季桓子。桓子诈之，得脱。定公九年,阳虎不胜，奔于齐。是时孔子年五十。
鲁定公八年，公山不狃在季桓子那里也感到不自在了，于是就勾结阳虎一同作乱，想废除季孙、叔孙、孟孙三家法定的嫡系继承人，而另立那些平日被阳虎所喜欢的庶子，于是他们把季桓子拘捕了。后来由于季桓子耍了一个花招，逃脱了出来。到了定公九年，阳虎被季桓子打败，逃到了齐国。这一年，孔子五十岁。
In the eighth year of Duke Ding,Gongshan Buniu who bore a grudge against the Ji family rebelled with Yang Hu,hoping to over- throw the heirs ofthe three chief families and set up in their place the concubines'sons befriended by Yang Hu.Ji Huanzi was captured but contrived to escape.In the ninth year of Duke Ding,Yang Hu was defeated and fled to Qi.By now Confucius was fifty.

公山不狃以费畔季氏，使人召孔子。孔子循道弥久,温温无所试,莫能己用，曰：“盖周文、武起丰、镐而王,今费虽小，傥庶几乎!”欲往。子路不说，止孔子。孔子曰：“夫召我者岂徒哉?如用我，其为东周乎!”然亦卒不行。其后定公以孔子为中都宰,一年，四方皆则之”。由中都宰为司空，由司空为大司寇。
这时公山不狃还占据着费邑和季桓子作对，他派人来请孔子。孔子从小学了很多东西，但始终没有机会施展，没有人用他，今天一见公山不狃来请他，就说：“当初文王、武王就是在丰、镐那么小地方起家而后称王的，今天的费邑虽小，也许能干出一件大事吧!”于是就按捺不住地想去。子路很不满意，反对孔子的想法。孔子说：“那些请我的人，难道就没有点更好的打算吗?如果他们重用我，我一定能在那里重建一个东方的周国!”但最后也还是没有去。后来鲁定公叫孔子做了中都的地方官，结果一年之间大见成效，吸引得周围各地的地方官们都来向他取经。很快地孔子也就由中都宰被提升到鲁国朝廷做了司空，又由司空晋升为大司寇。
Then Gongshan Buniu,who controlled the district of Bi,rebelled against the Ji family and sent for Confucius.Confucius had long been following the true way without being able to put it into practice be- cause no one would employ him.So now he said,“King Wen and King Wu of Zhou started from the districts of Feng and Hao and became kings.Though Bi is small,this may be worth trying.”He was planning to go,but Zilu demurred and stopped him. "He would not send for me without a reason,"said Confucius. "By using my services he could make another Zhou in the east." However,in the end he did not go.He was planning to go,but Zilu demurred and stopped him. "He would not send for me without a reason,"said Confucius. "By using my services he could make another Zhou in the east." However,in the end he did not go. Later Duke Ding appointed Confucius the magistrate of Zhongdu. After one year of his administration,allthe neighbouring districts were following his example.He was promoted to be minister of works, then chief justice.

定公十年春,及齐平。夏，齐大夫黎钽言于景公曰:“鲁用孔丘，其势危齐。”乃使使告鲁为好会，会于夹谷。鲁定公且以乘车好往。孔子摄相事,曰：“臣闻有文事者必有武备，有武事者必有文备。古者诸侯出疆，必具官以从,请具左右司马。”定公曰：“诺。”具左右司马。会齐侯夹谷，为坛位，土阶三等,以会遇之礼相见,揖让而登。献酬之礼毕,齐有司趋而进曰：“请奏四方之乐。”景公曰：“诺。”于是於旄羽祓矛戟剑拨鼓噪而至。孔子趋而进，历阶而登,不尽一等，举袂而言曰：“吾两君为好会，夷狄之乐何为于此!请命有司!”有司却之，不去，则左右视晏子与景公。景公心怍,麾而去之”。有顷，齐有司趋而进曰：“请奏宫中之乐。”景公曰：“诺。”优倡侏儒为戏而前。孔子趋而进，历阶而登，不尽一等，曰：“匹夫而营惑诸侯者罪当诛!请命有司!”有司加法焉，手足异处。景公惧而动，知义不若，归而大恐，告其群臣曰：“鲁以君子之道辅其君,而子独以夷狄之道教寡人，使得罪于鲁君，为之奈何?”有司进对曰：“君子有过则谢以质”,小人有过则谢以文。君若悼之，则谢以质。"于是齐侯乃归所侵鲁之郓、汶阳、龟阴之田以谢过。
鲁定公十年春，鲁国同齐国签订了和约。同年夏天，齐国的大夫黎钽对齐景公说：“现在鲁国正重用孔丘，这样发展下去对我们齐国是一种严重的威胁。”于是派人去邀请鲁定公来齐国的夹谷进行首脑间的友好会见。鲁定公准备坐平时用的轿车前往。孔子这时被任为代理宰相，陪伴同行。孔子说：“俗话说办文事也得有武力作后盾，办武事也得有文的一手做准备。自古以来凡是诸侯离开自己的国家，必须配备好文武官员随同前往。请您带上适当的武装保卫人员。”鲁定公说：“好的。”于是带上适当的武装保卫人员。到达夹谷时，只见那里已经修起了台子，台子的边上有三磴土台阶。鲁定公与齐景公按着应有的礼节见面后，彼此推让着登上了台子，互相敬过了酒，齐国的主管官员过来请示说：“请允许演奏四方的乐舞。”齐景公说：“好的。”于是一群武士举着旗帜拿着弓弩、矛戟、宝剑等各种武器，大呼小叫地一齐拥到了台下。孔子一见立刻小步急速地走到了台前，又一步一磴地站上了倒数第二磴台阶，他一挥袖子对着下面喝道：“现在是两国的君主在进行友好会见，弄这些夷狄的乐舞来干什么!请有关负责人立刻处置!”这时齐国的主管人示意叫他们退下，可是那些人不退。于是孔子就转过头来左右扫视晏子和齐景公，齐景公自己也觉得理亏，于是就挥手让那些人退了出去。过了一会儿，齐国的主管人员又过来请示说：“请允许演奏宫中的乐舞。”齐景公说：“好的。”于是一群跳舞唱歌的侏儒立刻拥上前来。孔子一见马上又小步急速上前，一步一磴地站上了倒数第二磴台阶说：“匹夫小人凡是胆敢惑乱诸侯视听的一律杀头，请有关负责人立刻处置!”于是齐国的主管官员只好把那些侏儒们一个个腰斩两截。齐景公一看，吓得大为震恐，知道自己的道义敌不住孔子，心里很害怕，回去对他的群臣们说：“鲁国的孔子是用君子之礼来辅佐他们的国君，而你们却用夷狄的那一套来给我帮倒忙，结果让我在鲁君的面前丢脸，这以后怎么办?”齐国的官员上前说：“君子有了过错就用实际行动来表示悔改，只有小人才在过错面前耍花腔。您如果心里真过意不去，那就最好有点实际表现。”于是齐景公立即下令把从前侵占的鲁国的郓、汶阳、龟阴等地还给了鲁国以表示认错。
In the spring of the tenth year of Duke Ding,Lu and Qi made peace.That summer Li Zu,a minister of Qi,warned Duke Jing of Qi, "Lu is employing Kong Qiu.That is dangerous for us."So they invited the duke of Lu to a friendly meeting at Jiagu.He was about to set off by carriage when Confucius,then acting prime minister,interposed,"I have heard that in peace men should prepare for war;in war they should prepare for peace,in the old days a baron never left his territory unless accompanied by military officials.I beg you to take the senior and junior war ministers.” Duke Ding agreed and took these two ministers to meet the duke of Qi at Jiagu.Seats had been placed on an earthen platform with three steps leading up to it and the two dukes met on equal terms, mounting the steps after bowing to each other.When wine had been .offered,Qi's master of ceremonies stepped forward to ask,"May we play the Music of the Four Quarters?” Upon Duke Jing's assenting,men with pennants,feathers,spears, halberds,swords and shields advanced to the roll of drums.At once Confucius stepped forward,rushed up the steps and,raising his sleeves, protested,“Our two rulers are meetingin friendship:what is the mean- ing of this barbarian music?Let these men be dismissed by the officer in charge!”The master of ceremonies made them step back,but they did not go.The attendants looked at Yan Ying and Duke Jing,and the shamefaced duke waved them away. Presently Qi's minister of ceremonies came forward again to ask, “May we play palace music?” When DukeJing assented,jesters,singers and dwarfs trooped in to perform.At once Confucius stepped forward,rushed up the steps and again protested,“Commoners who beguile their lords deserve to die.Let them be punished?Then the officer in charge had the players killed. Aware that he had been in the wrong,Duke Jing was greatly perturbed.He returned to his capital in dismay and reproached his ministers,saying,"In Lu they use the gentleman's way to guide their prince,while all you teach me is the barbarian way.Now we have offended the duke of Lu.What shall we do?”A minister advanced to reply,“A gentleman who is at fault shows his regret by deeds,while a low man shows it by words.If you are sorry,sir,show your regret by deeds.” So to make amends the duke returned to Lu the lands of Yun, Wenyang and Guiyin which he had taken.

定公十三年夏,孔子言于定公曰：“臣无藏甲,大夫毋百雉之城。”使仲由为季氏宰,将堕三都。于是叔孙氏先堕廊。季氏将堕费，公山不狃、叔孙辄率费人袭鲁。公与三子入于季氏之宫,登武子之台。费人攻之，弗克，入及公侧。孔子命申句须、乐颀下伐之,费人北。国人追之,败诸姑蔑。二子奔齐归，遂堕费。将堕成，公敛处父谓孟孙曰：“堕成，齐人必至于北门。且成，孟氏之保障,无成是无孟氏也，我将弗堕。”十二月，公围成，弗克。
鲁定公十三年夏，孔子对定公说：“家臣不准私藏武器，大夫的城墙不能长于三百丈。”于是他派子路到季孙氏家里做总管，准备把季孙、叔孙、孟孙三家封邑的城墙毁掉。这时叔孙氏先把邸邑的城墙拆掉了。接着季孙氏也要拆掉费邑的城墙。这时公山不狃和叔孙辄不服，他们带领着费邑人去袭击鲁国的都城。鲁定公无法，只好同季孙、叔孙、孟孙三人一同躲到了季孙氏的宫中，爬到了季武子的台上。费邑人包围了台子四面攻打，虽然没有攻下来，但有人已经快要蹿到鲁定公的身边了。于是孔子就命令申句须和乐颀下去与他们交战，结果费人被打败。接着都城里的人们趁势反攻，一直追到姑蔑，公山不狃和叔孙辄被打败逃到了齐国，于是费邑的城墙终于被毁掉了。接着又要拆除成邑的城墙，这时公敛处父对孟孙氏说：“如果成邑的城墙被毁掉了，那么齐国人就可以长驱直入地逼近鲁国国都的北门了。而且成邑是我们孟孙氏的根据地，如果没有成邑那我们孟孙氏也就完了，因此我绝不毁它。"十二月，鲁定公发兵围攻成邑，结果没有攻下。
In the summer of the thirteenth year of Duke Ding,Confucius told him,“A subject should not conceal arms,a noble should not have city walls three thousand feet long.” Zhong You was appointed steward under Ji Huanzi,but before he could demolish the fortified towns of the three chiefnobles,the Shusun family tore down the walls of Hou.When theJi clan tried to demolish the wall of Bi,Gongshan Buniu and Shusun Zhe led the men of Bi against the Lu capital;whereupon the duke and his three noble minis- ters withdrew to the Ji clan mansion and took refuge in the tower ofJi Wuzi.The men ofBiattacked the tower but failed to take it.When they came near the tower,Confucius sent Shen Juxu andLeQito fight back and the men of Bi were put to flight by the forces of Lu at Gumie.At that Gongshan Buniu and Shusun Zhe fled to Qiand the city ofBiwas demolished. They were about to tear down the wall of Cheng when Gonglian Chufu warned Mengsun,"If Cheng is demolished,we shall have the men of Qi at our North Gate.Besides,Cheng is the bulwark of the Meng family,without which we must fall.I refuse to destroy it.”In the twelfth month the duke besieged Cheng but failed to take it.

定公十四年,孔子年五十六，由大司寇行摄相事,有喜色。门人曰：“闻‘君子祸至不惧，福至不喜’。”孔子曰：“有是言也，不曰‘乐其以贵下人'乎?”于是诛鲁大夫乱政者少正卯。与闻国政三月,粥羔豚者弗饰贾,男女行者别于涂,涂不拾遗。四方之客至乎邑者不求有司,皆予之以归”。
鲁定公十四年，孔子五十六岁，这时他又从大司寇被任命为代理宰相，他的脸上流露出一种很高兴的样子。他的学生们一见，对他说：“人们常说‘君子在大祸临头的时候面无惧色，在福禄降临的时候也面无喜色’。”孔子说：“的确有这么一说。但你们没听说还有一种‘君子以有了高位能以礼贤下士为乐’吗?”于是孔子掌权后就把扰乱鲁国政局的大夫少正卵给杀了。在孔子参与鲁国政权的仅仅三个月里，鲁国那些贩卖羊羔猪仔的人们不再以次充好漫天要价；男人女人在路上行走时也自觉地分开来各走一边；丢在路上的东西没有人拾取；四面八方来到鲁国的客人，用不着到主管官员那里去求告，鲁国的百姓都能够使其各得所需而归。
In the fourteenth year of Duke Ding,Confucius,now fifty-six, appeared gratified when he was appointed both chief justice and prime minister. His pupils said,"We have heard that a gentleman would show no fear in the face of calamity,no joy in the face of good fortune.” "True,"replied Confucius."But what of the saying,He delights in high position because he can showhis humility?"Heexecuted Shaozheng Mao,a minister of Lu who had made trouble.After three months of his administration vendors of lamb and pork stopped raising their prices,men and women walked on different sides of the street,no one picked up anything lost on the road,and strangers coming to the city did not have to look for the officers in charge for everyone made them welcome.

齐人闻而惧，曰：“孔子为政必霸，霸则吾地近焉，我之为先并矣，盍致地焉?”黎钽曰：“请先尝沮之,沮之而不可则致地，庸迟乎!"于是选齐国中女子好者八十人,皆衣文衣而舞《康乐》,文马三十驷,遗鲁君。陈女乐文马于鲁城南高门外。季桓子微服往观再三，将受，乃语鲁君为周道游,往观终日，怠于政事。子路曰：“夫子可以行矣。”孔子曰：“鲁今且郊,如致播乎大夫,则吾犹可以止。”桓子卒受齐女乐，三日不听政；郊，又不致播俎于大夫，孔子遂行，宿乎屯。而师己送,曰：“夫子则非罪。”孔子曰：“吾歌可夫?”歌曰：“彼妇之口，可以出走；彼妇之谒，可以死败。盖优哉游哉，维以卒岁!”师己反，桓子曰：“孔子亦何言?”师己以实告。桓子喟然叹曰：“夫子罪我以群婢故也夫!”
齐景公听说这些消息心里很害怕，他说：“鲁国要是真让孔子当了政，那它就一定会称霸；鲁国一旦称了霸，离它最近的是齐国，那我们就势必要被他们吞并了。我们何不先割给他一些地盘，和他们搞好关系呢?”他的大夫黎钽说：“我们先想办法破坏它，如果破坏不成再割给他们地盘也来得及呀!”于是他就在齐国选择了八十个漂亮女子，给她们打扮得花团锦簇并教会她们跳《康乐》舞，又挑了用文彩装饰的骏马一百二十匹，把这些都一齐给鲁国送了去。到鲁国后他们把这些舞女和骏马都展览在鲁都城南的高门外。季桓子穿着便衣溜到那里去看了好几遍，从心里愿意接受。他给鲁定公安排了一次在都城到处游览的活动，这样他们就又一道去那里看了一整天，而无心再想政事。子路对孔子说：“先生可以离开这个国家了。”孔子说：“鲁国很快就该到郊外去祭天了，如果祭祀后还能把祭肉分送给大夫们，那我们就还可以留下来。”不想季桓子很快就正式地接受了齐国送来的东西，并一连三日不过问国家大事；等到郊外祭天的仪式结束后，又不把祭肉分送给大夫们。于是孔子只好离开鲁国了，当晚他们住在了鲁城南面的屯邑。这时鲁国的师己给他送行，师己对孔子说：“您可是没有任何过错的呀。”孔子说：“我可以唱个歌给你听听吗?”于是他就唱道：“妇人搬弄口舌，可以害得你四处奔波；妇人在君前告状，可以叫你人死国亡。我现在只能退出官场来优游自得地了此一生了!”师己回朝后，季桓子问他：“孔子临走时说了些什么?”师己就把实际情况向他说了一遍。季桓子伤心地说：“他是怪我接受了这群女人哪!”
When the men of Qi knew this they took fright and said,"With Confucius at the head of the state,Lu is bound to grow powerful;then we who are close to it will be the first to be swallowed up:We had better offer them some land.” But Li Zu said,"Let us first see if we can't foil them.If that fails, it will not be too late to offer land." So they chose eighty of the prettiest girls in Qi who could dance to the kang music,dressed them in gay costumes and sent them with sixty pairs of dappled horses as a gift to the duke of Lu.The dancers were displayed with the horses outside Gao Gate in the south city,and Ji Huanzi who went in disguise several times to see them was tempted to accept.He persuaded the duke to go there by a roundabout way,and they watched all day,neglecting state affairs. Then Zilu said,“Master,it is time to leave!” Confucius replied,"The duke will soon be sacrificing to heaven and earth.If he presents portions ofthe offerings to the ministers,I can stay." But Ji Huanzi accepted the dancers from Qi,for three days no court was held,and no meat was offered to the ministers at the sacrifice. So Confucius left,putting up for one night at Tun.Shi Yi,who had come to see him off,said,"This is not your fault,master." Confucius retorted,“Shall I sing you a song?”And he chanted: A woman's tongue Can cost a man his post; A woman's words Can cost a man his head; Then why not retire To spend my last years as I please? Upon Shi Yi's return Ji Huanzi asked,"What did Confucius say?” When told,he said with a sigh,"I've offended the master because of a pack of girls.”

孔子遂适卫,主于子路妻兄颜浊邹家。卫灵公问孔子:“居鲁得禄几何?”对曰：“奉粟六万。”卫人亦致粟六万。居顷之，或谮孔子于卫灵公。灵公使公孙余假一出一入。孔子恐获罪焉，居十月，去卫。
于是孔子到了卫国，他住在子路的妻兄颜浊邹的家里。这时卫灵公向人打听说：“孔子在鲁国享受多少俸禄?”有人告诉他：“大约是六万斗谷子。”于是卫灵公也给了孔子六万斗谷子的待遇。没过多久，有人就在卫灵公面前说孔子的坏话了。于是卫灵公就指使公孙余假带着兵器到孔子那里去进出了几回，孔子怕有更大的麻烦，于是只在卫国住了十个月就又走了。
Confucius went to Wei (1024B.C.-209B.C.)and lived with Zilu's brother-in-law Yan Zhuozou.Duke Ling of Wei asked,“What stipend had Confucius in Lu?” He was told,“Sixty thousand measures of grain.” So Wei also gave him sixty thousand measures.Later someone slandered Confucius to Duke Ling,who ordered Gongsun Yujia to set a guard over him.Then Confucius,fearing trouble,left after a stay of ten months.

将适陈，过匡,颜刻为仆,以其策指之曰：“昔吾入此，由彼缺也。”匡人闻之，以为鲁之阳虎。阳虎尝暴匡人,匡人于是遂止孔子。孔子状类阳虎，拘焉五日。颜渊后,子曰：“吾以汝为死矣。”颜渊曰：“子在，回何敢死!”匡人拘孔子益急，弟子惧。孔子曰：“文王既没，文不在兹乎?天之将丧斯文也，后死者不得与于斯文也;天之未丧斯文也，匡人其如予何!”孔子使从者为宁武子臣于卫，然后得去。
孔子准备到陈国去，中途经过卫国的匡邑，颜刻这时给他赶车。颜刻用马鞭子指着城墙说：“我过去曾进过匡邑，就从那个缺口进去的。”匡人听他这么一说，误认为是鲁国的阳虎又来了，因为不久前阳虎曾进攻抄掠过匡邑人，而孔子的样子又像阳虎，于是匡人就把孔子扣了起来，而且是一连扣了五天。五天后颜渊赶到了，孔子说：“我以为你已经死了。”颜渊说：“您还活着，我怎么能死呢!”匡人对孔子看管得更紧了，弟子们都很害怕。孔子说：“文王死了之后，传统文化的继承人不就是我了吗?老天爷要是真想叫这种传统文化断绝，那它就不会让我再学得这套东西；老天爷要是不想叫这种传统文化断绝，那匡人又能把我怎么样呢!”后来孔子打发了他的一个学生去给卫国的宁武子做家臣，而后匡人才放孔子走了。
He was passing Kuang on his way to Chen when Yan Ke,who was accompanying him,pointed to the city wall with his whip and said, "I got in through that gap before." Some men of Kuang heard this and mistook Confucius for Yang Hu of Lu,who had treated them badly.They had detained him for five days because of his resemblance to Yang Hu,when Yan Hui arrived. Confucius told him,"I thought you were dead." Yan Hui answered,“How dare I die when you are still living,master?” The men of Kuang now behaved in such a threatening way that the followers of Confucius were afraid.But he said,“Since King Wen is no more,who but I can be the standard-bearer of culture?If Heaven had wanted culture to disappear,I should not have possessed it after all this time.And if Heaven does not intend culture to disappear,what can the men of Kuang do to me?”He sent one of his followers to serve Ning Wuzi in Wei and was finally able to leave.

去即过蒲。月余，反乎卫，主蘧伯玉家。灵公夫人有南子者,使人谓孔子曰：“四方之君子不辱欲与寡君为兄弟者,必见寡小君。寡小君愿见。”孔子辞谢，不得已而见之。夫人在缔帷中,孔子入门，北面稽首。夫人自帷中再拜，环佩玉声璆然。孔子曰：“吾乡为弗见，见之礼答焉。”子路不说。孔子矢之曰:“予所不者，天厌之!天厌之!”居卫月余，灵公与夫人同车，宦者雍渠参乘,出，使孔子为次乘,招摇市过之。孔子曰：“吾未见好德如好色者也。”于是丑之，去卫，过曹。是岁，鲁定公卒。
孔子离开匡邑到了蒲乡。在蒲乡住了一个月，又回到了卫国，住在蘧伯玉家。这时卫灵公有位夫人叫做南子，她打发人来对孔子说：“各国的名人凡是来到卫国想跟我们国君交好的，一定也都来见见我们的夫人。现在我们的夫人想见见您。”孔子开始时推辞不见，后来没法只得去了。这时南子坐在一层薄薄的纱幕后面。孔子进门后，向着北面叩头，南子也在纱幕后还礼，她身上的各种佩戴发出叮当的声响。孔子回来对他的弟子们说：“我开始本来是不愿意去的，后来实在没法我才去和她见了见礼。”子路很不高兴，孔子见弟子们不相信，就发誓说：“如果我说的不是真心话，那就让老天爷抛弃我，让老天爷抛弃我!”过了一个来月，有一天卫灵公外出，他和南子同坐一辆车，让宦官雍渠同车侍候，而让孔子坐在了第二辆车子上，大家一起成群结队地到大街上招摇而过。孔子感到羞耻地说：“我还真没见过谁能爱好道德像爱好美色一样。”于是就离开了卫国到曹国去了。也就在这一年，鲁定公去世了。
Proceeding to Pu,he returned after a month and more to Wei and stayed with Qu Boyu.There Duke Ling's wife,Nanzi,sent Confucius this message,"When gentlemen from other lands honour our lord with their friendship,they always call on his lady.She would like to meet you.”Confucius declined at first,then was forced to comply.The lady sat behind a linen curtain to receive him.Confucius,entering,faced north and bowed low.She returned his bow behind the curtain and her jade pendants tinkled. "I did not want to go,"said Confucius later,"but once there I had to conform to etiquette."Since Zilu looked displeased he made an oath:"If what I did was wrong,may Heaven punish me!May Heaven punish me!”He had been over a month in Wei when Duke Ling drove out in a carriage with his lady escortetl by the eunuch Yong Qu,and with Confucius as assistant escort.In this fashion they drove openly through the streets. Confucius commented,"I have yet to see the man who loves vir- tue as much as he loves feminine beauty."He left Wei in disgust for Cao.That year Duke Ding of Lu died.

孔子去曹适宋,与弟子习礼大树下。宋司马桓帷欲杀孔子,拔其树。孔子去。弟子曰：“可以速矣。”孔子曰：“天生德于予，桓魁其如予何!”
后来孔子又离开曹国到了宋国，他和弟子们在一棵大树下演习礼仪。宋国的司马桓魁想杀孔子，就派人把那棵大树砍掉了。孔子只好领着弟子们又离开了宋国。有人说：“为了防止危险我们还是走快点吧!”孔子说：“老天爷已经把品格、责任赋予了我，桓魁又能把我怎么样呢!”
From Cao Confucius went to Song.He was expounding the rites to his pupils under a great tree when Huan Tui,the war minister of Song who wanted to kill him,sent men to fell the tree.Confucius withdrew,and his disciples urged,"Let us hurry away!" But Confucius said,"Heaven has implanted virtue in me.What can men like Huan Tui do to me?”

孔子适郑,与弟子相失，孔子独立郭东门。郑人或谓子贡曰:“东门有人，其颡似尧,其项类皋陶,其肩类子产,然自要以下不及禹三寸,累累若丧家之狗。”子贡以实告孔子。孔子欣然笑曰：“形状，未也;而谓似‘丧家之狗’,然哉!然哉!”
孔子在到达郑国的时候，和他的弟子们走散了，孔子一个人孤零零地站在郑国的东门口。有个郑国人对子贡说：“东门外有个人，他的前额有点像唐尧，他的脖子后头有点像皋陶，他的肩膀有点像子产，他的下半身比大禹矮三寸，他那萎靡不振的样子活像一只丧家狗。”子贡找到孔子后就把那个人的话如实地对孔子说了。孔子一听反而开心地笑起来，说：“他所美言的我那种相貌，我可真是不敢当。但他说我像只丧家狗，那可真是对极了!对极了!”
Going on to Zheng,Confucius was separated from his followers. He was standing alone at the East Gate when a citizen of Zheng re- marked to Zigong,"There is a man at the East Gate with a forehead like Yao,a neck like Gao Tao and shoulders like Zichan,and just three inches shorter below the waist than'Yu.Lost as a stray dog he looks!" When this was repeated to Confucius,he chuckled.“The appear- ance is unimportant,"he said.“But it's true that I’m like a stray dog. That is certainly true!”

孔子遂至陈，主于司城贞子家。岁余，吴王夫差伐陈,取三邑而去。赵鞅伐朝歌。楚围蔡，蔡请迁于吴。吴败越王句践会稽。
孔子又来到了陈国，住在司城贞子家。过了一年多，吴王夫差派兵伐陈，夺去了陈国的三个邑。接着晋国的赵鞅领兵攻打卫国的朝歌。楚国派兵围攻蔡都，逼得蔡国迁到了吴国境内。而吴国在会稽打败了越王句践。
Confucius proceeded to Chen and stayed with Sicheng Zhenzi for a year and more.Then King Fucha of Wu attacked Chen and took three towns.Zhao Yang attacked Chaoge.The army of Chu invaded Cai and the capital of Cai was moved to Wu.The forces of Wu de- feated King Goujian of Yue at Kuaiji.

有隼集于陈廷而死,横矢贯之,石磐,矢长尺有咫。陈滑公使使问仲尼。仲尼曰：“隼来远矣，此肃慎之矢也。昔武王克商,通道九夷百蛮,使各以其方贿来贡,使无忘职业。于是肃慎贡横矢石怒，长尺有咫。先王欲昭其令德,以肃慎矢分大姬,配虞胡公而封诸陈。分同姓以珍玉,展亲；分异姓以远方职,使无忘服。故分陈以肃慎矢。”试求之故府，果得之。
不久，有只鹰落在陈国宫廷的树上死了，身上还带着一支横木做的箭，箭头是石头做的，箭长一尺八寸，陈滑公派人来问孔子。孔子说：“这只鹰来得可远了，它身上带的是肃慎人使用的箭。当初周武王灭商后，曾跟四面八方的少数民族都沟通了关系，让他们通过进贡各国出产的东西以记住各自对中央天子应尽的义务。当时肃慎人就是进贡的一种横木杆、石箭头的箭，有一尺八寸那么长。当时周武王想表彰舜的道德，就把这种箭给他的女儿大姬作陪嫁，嫁给了舜的后代胡公，把胡公封在了陈国。当时周武王分给同姓诸侯们以珍珠美玉，是为了表示关系亲密；分给异姓诸侯以远方来的贡品，是为了让他们永远臣服于周朝。所以当时把肃慎箭分给了陈国。”陈滑公听说后派人到府库里一查，果然找到了这种箭。
A falcon fell dead in the court of Chen,shot by a thorn arrow eighteen inches long with an arrowhead of stone.Duke Min of Chen was sent to consult Confucius,who said,"This falcon has come a long way.The arrow belongs to the Churchens.When King Wu conquered the Shangs he opened up communications with all the eastern and south- ern barbarians,ordering them to send in their local products as tribute and not to fail in this duty.The Churchens used to send thorn arrows with stone arrowheads like this,eighteen inches long.And to make known his glory and virtue,the king gave these arrows with the fief of Chen to his eldest daughter when she married Duke Hu of Yu.Pre- cious jade was distributed amonghis kinsmen to strengthen their bonds, and other clans were given tribute from distant parts that they might not forget their allegiance.This is how these Churchen arrows were given to Chen.”The duke looked in the old treasury and actually found similar arrows there.

孔子居陈三岁,会晋楚争强，更伐陈,及吴侵陈，陈常被寇。孔子曰：“归与归与!吾党之小子狂简,进取不忘其初。”于是孔子去陈。
孔子在陈国住了三年，后来赶上晋国和楚国争胜，双方轮流着攻打陈国。后来又加上吴国也侵犯，陈国处处挨打。孔子无可奈何地说：“回家吧!回家吧!我们自己故乡的那些子弟们虽然志大才疏，但他们积极进取都能不忘初志。”于是孔子离开了陈国。
During the three years Confucius spent in Chen,the state was in- vaded again and again,now by Jin,now by Chu,in their contest for supremacy,and also by Wu. "Let us return!"cried Confucius."Let us return!We may be ambitious,reckless fellows,but in our quest we do not forget our origin."With that he left Chen.

过蒲，会公叔氏以蒲畔,蒲人止孔子。弟子有公良孺者,以私车五乘从孔子。其为人长贤,有勇力，谓曰：“吾昔从夫子遇难于匡，今又遇难于此，命也已。吾与夫子再罹难,宁斗而死。"斗甚疾。蒲人惧,谓孔子曰：“苟毋适卫，吾出子。”与之盟,出孔子东门。孔子遂适卫。子贡曰：“盟可负邪?”孔子曰：“要盟也，神不听。”
当孔子路过卫国的蒲邑时，正赶上公叔氏在蒲邑发动叛乱，叛乱分子们把孔子留住了。这时孔子的弟子中有个叫公良孺的，他正带着他私人家的五乘车跟着孔子。他身高体壮，勇力过人，他愤怒地对人们宣布说：“我已经跟着先生在匡邑遭过一回难，今天又赶上在这里倒霉，这不是命吗!与其让我跟着先生再一次陷入困境，干脆我豁出命去同他们拼了。”说罢就奋力战斗。蒲人也怕了，他们对孔子说：“你们只要答应我们不去卫国，我们就马上放你们出去。”孔子一听就和他们起了誓，而他们也就放孔子出了东门。结果孔子一转身就又去了卫国。子贡说：“您刚才起了誓，难道可以随便变吗?”孔子说：“在武力威胁下订立的盟约，神是不给作证的。”
Gongshu rebelled in Pu while Confucius was passing through,and the men of Pu detained him.Among his disciples was a certain Gongliang Ru who had accompanied him with five ofhis own chariots. A tall and enormously strong man,he said,"I was with the master when we ran into trouble in Kuang,and here we are in trouble again. Well,this must be fate and at least I can die fighting.” He put up such a fight that the men of Pu were afraid and told Confucius,"If you don't go to Wei,you may leave." He gave them his word and they let him out through the East Gate.He still proceeded to Wei and Zigong asked,"Is it right to break your word?” Confucius replied,"I gave it under pressure:the gods will not count it.”

卫灵公闻孔子来，喜，郊迎。问曰：“蒲可伐乎?”对曰：“可。”灵公曰：“吾大夫以为不可。今蒲，卫之所以待晋、楚也,以卫伐之，无乃不可乎?”孔子曰：“其男子有死之志,妇人有保西河之志,吾所伐者不过四五人。”灵公曰：“善。”然不伐蒲。
卫灵公听说孔子从蒲邑来了，很高兴地到郊外迎接。他问孔子说：“你看我们出兵伐蒲邑行吗?”孔子说：“行。”卫灵公说：“可是我的大夫们都说不行。他们说，留着蒲邑日后可以对付晋、楚。如果我们讨伐它，恐怕不好吧?”孔子说：“那里的男人们都对叛乱分子宁死不屈，那里的女人们都发誓不离西河故土。需要我们去打的叛乱分子顶多不过四五个人。"卫灵公说：“说得对。”但他始终也没有出兵。
Delighted to hear that Confucius was back,Duke Ling of Wei welcomed him outside the city and asked,“Can we attack Pu?” Confucius answered,"Yes." The duke said,"My ministers are against it because Pu is a buffer between us and Jin and Chu.Does that not make it wrong to attack it?” Confucius said,"The men there are ready to die for our state and the women are determined to defend Xihe.We shall only punish a handful of rebels." The duke approved but did not attack in the end.

灵公老，怠于政，不用孔子。孔子喟然叹曰：“苟有用我者，期月而已，三年有成。”孔子行。
这时卫灵公已经年纪很大了，无心再过问政治，也不想重用孔子。孔子感慨地说：“谁要能用我去治理国家，保证他一年初见效果，三年大有所成。”孔子只好又走了。
Since Duke Ling was old and had lost interest in state affairs,he did not give office to Confucius. Confucius sighed and said,"To be in office for just one year would satisfy me.In three years real results would show."After that he left.

佛胖为中牟宰,赵简子攻范、中行，伐中牟。佛胖畔,使人召孔子，孔子欲往。子路曰：“由闻诸夫子，‘其身亲为不善者，君子不入也’。今佛胖亲以中牟畔，子欲往，如之何?”孔子曰：“有是言也。不曰坚乎，磨而不磷；不曰白乎，涅而不淄,我岂匏瓜也哉,焉能系而不食?”
晋国的佛胖在中牟做长官，赵简子在打败了同僚范氏、中行氏后，进而东下攻取中牟。佛胖率邑人叛晋，并派人请孔子去中牟。孔子想去。子路对孔子说：“从前我听您说过：‘凡是亲手干坏事的人，君子是不到他那里去的。’现在佛胖在中牟叛晋，而您却还想去，这是怎么回事?”孔子说：“的确是有你那么一说。但我不是还说过么?真正坚硬的东西是怎么磨也磨不坏的，真正洁白的东西是怎么染也染不黑的。我可不是一个葫芦啊，怎么能只是让它挂在那里中看不中吃呢?”
Bi Xi was then the steward of Zhongmou.When Jianzi of the Zhao clan attacked the Fan andZhonghang clans he struck atZhongmou too,and Bi Xi rebelled.He sent for Confucius,who was willing to join him. But Zilu protested,"I have heard you say,master,'A gentleman will not enter the house of an evil-doer.'How can you think of going to BiXi who has rebelled in Zhongmou?” "True,"replied Confucius.“But is there not also a saying,Too hard to be ground thin,too white to be dyed black?Am I a gourd to hang here and never be eaten?”

孔子击磬,有荷蒉而过门者,曰：“有心哉，击磬乎!砼砼乎,莫己知也夫而已矣!”
有一天孔子正在屋里敲磬，有个背着大草筐的人在门口经过，一听屋里敲磬的声音他感叹说：“心里是有苦闷呵，听这砼砼的磬声就可以明白!何必呢，没有人了解也就算了吧!”
One day Confucius was playing the chimes when a man with a wicker crate passed the door and said,"Poor fellow,playing the chimes! He is self-willed but does not know himself.It is useless to talk with him.”

孔子学鼓琴师襄子,十日不进。师襄子曰：“可以益矣。”孔子曰：“丘已习其曲矣,未得其数也。”有间，曰：“已习其数，可以益矣。”孔子曰：“丘未得其志也。”有间，曰：“已习其志，可以益矣。”孔子曰：“丘未得其为人也。”有间，有所穆然深思焉,有所怡然高望而远志焉。曰：“丘得其为人：黯然而黑,几然而长，眼如望羊，如王四国,非文王其谁能为此也!”师襄子辟席再拜，曰：“师盖云《文王操》也。”
后来孔子跟着师襄学弹琴，他把这个曲子一连练了十天还不向下学。师襄说：“可以练点新的了。”孔子说：“我现在才只是学会了乐曲的弹奏方法，还没有成为一种熟练的技巧。”又过了几天，师襄说：“技巧已经掌握，可以练点新的了。”孔子说：“我还没有体会到乐曲表现的思想情操。”又过了几天，师襄说：“已经体会了乐曲的思想情操，可以练点新的了。”孔子说：“我还没有看到乐曲中所表现的人物形象。”又过了些天，孔子有了一种严肃深刻的理解，产生了一种心情舒畅登高望远的感觉。他说：“我已经体会到乐曲所歌颂的那个人了，那个人是黑黑的脸膛，高高的个子，眼睛炯炯有神地望着远方，是一位统有天下的帝王，这个人如果不是周文王还能是谁呢?”师襄一听立刻离开座位向孔子行礼说：“我的老师说这个曲子应该就叫做《文王操》。”
Confucius practised playing the lute for ten days without attempt- ing anything new.Shi Xiang,his tutor,said,“You can go ahead now.” "I have learned the tune but not the technique,"said Confucius. After some time Shi Xiang said,"You have mastered the measure now,you can go on.” But Confucius replied,"I have not yet caught the spirit."Some time later the other said,"Now you have caught the spirit, you can go on.” "I cannot yet visualize the man behind it,"answered Confucius. Later he observed,"This is the work of a man who thought deeply and seriously,one who saw far ahead and had a calm,lofty outlook." He continued,"I see him now.He is dark and tall,with far-seeing eyes that seem to command all the kingdoms around.No one but King Wen could have composed this music." Shi Xiang rose from his seat and bowed as he rejoined,"Yes,this is the Lute-song of King Wen. ”

孔子既不得用于卫，将西见赵简子。至于河而闻窦鸣犊、舜华之死也,临河而叹曰：“美哉水，洋洋乎!丘之不济此，命也夫!”子贡趋而进曰：“敢问何谓也?”孔子曰：“窦鸣犊、舜华，晋国之贤大夫也。赵简子未得志之时，须此两人而后从政;及其已得志，杀之。丘闻之也，刳胎杀夭则麒麟不至郊,竭泽涸渔则蛟龙不合阴阳,覆巢毁卵则凤皇不翔。何则?讳伤其类也。夫鸟兽之于不义也尚知辟之,而况乎丘哉!”乃还息乎陬乡,作为《陬操》以哀之。而反乎卫，入主蘧伯玉家。
孔子由于在卫国不被重用，于是就准备西行到晋国去找赵简子。刚走到黄河岸边就听到了窦鸣犊和舜华被赵简子杀害的消息，于是孔子就对着河水感慨地说：“多么美丽的黄河呀，浩浩荡荡!我一辈子不能渡水西行恐怕也是命里注定的吧!”子贡一听，过来问道：“您这话是什么意思呢?”孔子说：“窦鸣犊和舜华，都是晋国的贤大夫。赵简子在没有得势以前，是靠这两个人的提拔上的台；等到他一旦得势，就首先把这两个人杀掉了。俗话说，哪里有人剖腹取胎，麒麟就不到那个地方去；哪里有人淘干了水捕鱼，蛟龙就不给那里下雨；哪里有人捅翻了鸟巢去取鸟蛋，凤凰就决不到那里去。为什么呢?就因为不愿意看到自己的同类受害。鸟兽对于不仁义的事情还都知道躲避，更何况我孔丘呢!”于是他退回到了陬乡，在陬乡谱写了一曲《陬操》来哀悼窦鸣犊和舜华的死。而后又来到了卫国，住在了蘧伯玉家。
Since Confucius had not been employed in Wei,he decided to go west to see Zhao Jianzi.But upon reaching the Yellow River he re- ceived news of the death of Dou Mingdu and Shun Hua and,facing the water,said with a sigh,“A grand sweep of water!But I am not fated to'cross it.” Zigong stepped forward to ask,“What do you mean?” Confucius replied,"Dou Mingdu and Shun Hua were good min- isters of Jin.Before Zhao Jianzi rose to power he insisted on having these men before he would join the government;but now that he is in power he has killed them.I have heard that when you destroy unborn animals or killyoung game,the unicon will not come to the countryside; when you dredge and empty the ponds while fishing,the dragon willnot harmonize the yin and yang;when you upset a nest and destroy the eggs,the phoenix will not hover nearby.It follows that a gentleman must take offence if one of his kind is injured.If the very birds and beasts shun the unjust,how much more must I!” He went back to stay in the village of Zou,where he composed the Lute-song of Zou to mourn the two men.Then,returning to Wei,he became the guest of Qu Boyu.

他日，灵公问兵陈。孔子曰：“俎豆之事则尝闻之,军旅之事未之学也。”明日，与孔子语，见蜚雁,仰视之，色不在孔子。孔子遂行，复如陈。
有一天，卫灵公向孔子询问行兵打仗的事情。孔子说：“祭祀方面的事情，我曾经学过，至于行兵打仗，我没有学过。”第二天，卫灵公在和孔子谈话的时候，眼睛望着天上的鸿雁，注意力根本不在孔子。于是孔子便离开卫国，又来到了陈国。
Some time later,Duke Ling consulted him about warfare."I know something about sacrificial vessels,"said Confucius,"but have never studied military science.”The next day during a conversation with him, the duke saw some wild geese in the sky and looked up at them,ignor- ing the sage.So Confucius went back to Chen.

夏，卫灵公卒，立孙辄，是为卫出公。六月，赵鞅内太子蒯聩于戚。阳虎使太子绝，八人衰绖，伪自卫迎者，哭而入，遂居焉。冬，蔡迁于州来。是岁鲁哀公三年，而孔子年六十矣。齐助卫围戚,以卫太子蒯聩在故也。
这年夏天，卫灵公死了，他的孙子姬辄继了位，这就是卫出公。六月，晋国赵鞅把卫灵公的太子蒯聩送进了卫国的戚邑。阳虎让蒯聩头上扎着孝箍，让跟随他的八个人也都穿着孝服，让他们假装是从卫国都城出来准备到晋国去迎接蒯聩的人，他们哭着混进了戚邑，就在那里住了下来。这年冬天，蔡国把都城由新蔡迁到了州来。这一年是鲁哀公三年，孔子整六十岁。紧接着齐国就出兵帮着卫国包围了戚邑，因为卫国的流亡太子蒯聩躲在这里。
That summer Duke Ling of Wei died and his grandson Zhe suc- ceeded him as Duke Chu.In the sixth month Zhao Yang sent the crown prince,Kuai Kui,to the town of Qi.Yang Hu dressed the prince in deep mourning and made eight other mourners,ostensibly from Wei, welcome him with tears into the town.And there he stayed.That win- ter Cai's capital was moved to Zhoulai.This was the third year of Duke Ai ofLu,when Confucius was sixty years old.Qi helped Wei to besiege the town of Qi because the crown prince was there.

夏，鲁桓、鳌庙燔,南宫敬叔救火。孔子在陈，闻之，曰：“灾必于桓、鳌庙乎?”已而果然。
同年夏天，鲁国桓公、鳌公的庙里的柱被焚毁，南宫敬叔负责了这次救火的事宜。这时孔子正在陈国，他一听到鲁国失火的消息，马上说：“被烧的一定是桓公和鳌公的柱。”事后证明果然如此。
That summer a fire broke out in the temples of Duke Huan and Duke Xi of Lu,and Nangong Jingshu put it out.Confucius,then in Chen,heard of this conflagration and said,"It was probably in the temples of Duke Huan and Duke Xi."And he was proved correct.

秋，季桓子病，辇而见鲁城,喟然叹曰：“昔此国几兴矣，以吾获罪于孔子，故不兴也。”顾谓其嗣康子曰:“我即死,若必相鲁；相鲁，必召仲尼。”后数日，桓子卒，康子代立。已葬，欲召仲尼。公之鱼曰:“昔吾先君用之不终,终为诸侯笑。今又用之，不能终，是再为诸侯笑。”康子曰：“则谁召而可?”曰：“必召冉求。”于是使使召冉求。冉求将行，孔子曰：“鲁人召求，非小用之，将大用之也。”是日，孔子曰：“归乎归乎!吾党之小子狂简，斐然成章,吾不知所以裁之。”子赣知孔子思归,送冉求，因诫曰“即用，以孔子为招”云。
这年秋天，鲁国的季桓子病了，他让人抬着出来巡视鲁都的城墙，非常感慨地说：“过去这个国家曾一度几乎要兴旺起来了，就是因为我闹得让孔子离开了这个国家，所以鲁国就没有能振兴起来。”他回头看着他的继承人季康子说：“我死了以后，你一定会接替我做鲁国的宰相，你做了宰相之后，一定要去把孔子叫回来。”几天后，季桓子去世了，季康子接着当了鲁国的宰相，他安葬完了季桓子，就准备派人去叫孔子。这时公之鱼拦阻说：“当初我们的老宰相就因为对待孔子没能善始善终所以才遭到了诸侯们的耻笑。今天我们又要用他，如果再不能善始善终那就要又惹得诸侯们耻笑了。”季康子说：“那我们叫谁来好呢?”公之鱼说：“可以叫孔子的弟子冉求。”于是季康子就派了人去叫冉求。冉求准备动身前，孔子对他说：“鲁国派人来叫你回去，一定不会小用你，他们一定会大用你的。”也就在同一天，孔子感叹地说：“回去吧，回去吧!我家乡的那些学生们志大才疏，他们下笔成章而又文情并茂，我都不知道该怎么引导他们才好。”子贡心里明白这是孔子也想回鲁国。于是他在给冉求送行的时候，对冉求说：“你回去一旦主了事，可一定要想办法把咱们先生接回去。”
That autumn JiHuanzi fell ill.Driven in his carriage to the city wall of Lu,he said with a sigh,"This state could have become great ill had not offended Confucius.”Then turning to his heir Ji Kangzi,he said, “Once I am dead you will become prime minister of Lu.When that happens,you must ask Confucius to come back.” A few days later he died andJi Kangzi succeeded him.After the funeral the new prime minister wanted to recall Confucius,but Gong- zhi Yu said,“Our former lord lost faith in him in the end,so that other states laughed at us.If we have him back and find we cannot put his ideas into practice,we shall only make ourselves ridiculous again.” "In that case,whom shall we get?" "Recall Ran Qiu." SoJi Kangzi sent for Ran Qiu. When Ran Qiu was leaving,Confucius said,"The men of Lu can- not be recalling Ran Qiu for any small task,but must mean to entrust important work to him."Later that day he exclaimed,"Let us return! Let us return!My pupils aspire to great things.But although they have certain elegant accomplishments,I do not know how to educate them properly.” Zigong knew that Confucius longed to return to Lu,so while see- ing Ran Qiu off he said,"If you are in power,make sure the master is recalled."

冉求既去，明年,孔子自陈迁于蔡。蔡昭公将如吴,吴召之也。前昭公欺其臣迁州来,后将往，大夫惧复迁,公孙翩射杀昭公。楚侵蔡。秋，齐景公卒。
冉求离开孔子回鲁国的第二年，孔子从陈国又转到了蔡国。这时蔡昭公正准备去吴国，因为吴王叫他去。在此以前蔡昭公曾因为亲吴而欺骗他的大臣把国都由新蔡迁到了州来，这次他又要去吴国，大臣们担心他答应吴国把蔡国的国都再往东迁，于是公孙翩就把蔡昭公给射死了。不久，楚国发兵侵蔡。同一年秋天，齐景公去世了。
The year following Ran Qiu's departure,Confucius moved from Chen to Cai.Duke Zhao of Cai decided to go to Wu after receiving a summons from that state.As the duke had already moved the capital to Zhoulai without consulting his ministers,now that he wanted to go to Wu they feared he might move the capital again,and Gongsun Pian shot and killed him.Chu invaded Cai.That autumn Duke Jing of Qi died.

明年，孔子自蔡如叶。叶公问政,孔子曰：“政在来远附迩。”他日，叶公问孔子于子路,子路不对。孔子闻之，曰：“由，尔何不对曰‘其为人也，学道不倦，诲人不厌，发愤忘食，乐以忘忧，不知老之将至'云尔。”
又过了一年，孔子由蔡国来到了叶邑。叶公向孔子问治理国家的办法，孔子说：“治理国家的关键是在于能让远方的人都来投奔，让近处的人都能拥护。”有一天，叶公问子路孔子是一个什么样的人，子路没有回答。后来孔子听说这件事，就对子路说：“仲由，你为什么不对他说‘他是一个学习起来不知道疲倦，教育别人从不会厌烦，发愤读书时可以忘记吃饭，又常常自得其乐而忘记了忧愁，就这样日复一日地从不觉得自己是年老的人’。”
The next year Confucius went from Cai to Ye.Asked about gov- ernment by the duke of Ye,he replied,"The art lies in attracting the people from far away and winning the hearts of those close by." Another time the duke of Ye asked Zilu his opinion of his master, but Zilu did not reply.When Confucius heard this he said,"Why didn’t you tell him,'He is a man who never wearies of studying the truth, never tires of teaching others,but who in his eagerness forgets his hunger and in his joy forgets his bitter lot,not worrying that old age is creeping on?”

去叶，反于蔡。长沮、桀溺耦而耕,孔子以为隐者，使子路问津焉。长沮曰：“彼执舆者为谁?”子路曰：“为孔丘。”曰：“是鲁孔丘与?”曰：“然。”曰：“是知津矣。”桀溺谓子路曰：“子为谁?”曰：“为仲由。”曰：“子，孔丘之徒与?”曰：“然。”桀溺曰：“悠悠者天下皆是也,而谁以易之?且与其从辟人之士,岂若从辟世之士哉!”覆而不辍。子路以告孔子，孔子怃然曰:“鸟兽不可与同群，天下有道，丘不与易也。”
随后离开了叶邑，又回到了蔡国。途中遇到长沮、桀溺两个人在地里一道耕作，孔子看着他们像两个隐士，就让子路过去向他们询问渡口在哪里。长沮说：“车子上坐的那位拉着缰绳的是谁?”子路说：“是孔丘。”长沮说：“是鲁国的那个孔丘吗?”子路说：“正是。”长沮说：“那他自己应该知道渡口在哪儿。”接着桀溺又对子路说：“你是谁?”子路说：“我是仲由。”桀溺说：“你是孔丘的弟子吗?”子路说：“正是。”桀溺说：“动荡不安的局面普天下都是一样的，谁能改变得了它?你与其跟着那种躲避坏人的人到处乱跑，还不如来跟着我们这些躲避整个社会的人呢!”一边说着一边不住地撒种子盖土。子路回来把听到的话告诉了孔子，孔子伤心地说：“我们是不能自甘同那些飞禽走兽去一起生活的。如果天下都合乎了正道，那我也就不会像现在这样东奔西走地想去改变它了。”
On the road from Ye to Cai they met Changju and Jieni ploughing together.Taking them for recluses,Confucius told Zilu to ask them the way to the ford. "Who is the man holding the reins of your carriage?"asked Chang- ju. Zilu answered,"That is Kong Qiu." “You mean Kong Qiu of Lu?” That's right,"said Zilu. "He should know where the ford is then,"retorted Changju. Then Jieni.asked Zilu,“And who are you?” He answered,“My name is Zhong Yu.” “Are you a disciple of Kong Qiu?” "Yes,I am." "The whole world goes its way and who is to change it?"asked Jieni."Better,surely,to follow those who shun the world than one who only shuns certain men?" With that they went on covering the seed. Zilu returned and told Confucius,who commented ruefully,"Birds and beasts are no company for men.If the world were on the right path I should not try to change it.”

他日，子路行，遇荷蔡丈人,曰：“子见夫子乎?”丈人曰：“四体不勤,五谷不分,孰为夫子!”植其杖而芸。子路以告，孔子曰：“隐者也。”复往，则亡。
又有一天，子路在半道上和孔子走散了，他遇见一个背着草筐的老人。子路问他：“您见到我们先生了吗?”老人说：“一个人空长着四肢不会劳动，连五谷也分不清，那算是什么先生?”说罢就放下拐杖去锄起草来。子路回来把经过向孔子一说，孔子说：“这一定是位隐士。”他叫子路再去找他，老人早已不见了。
Another day on the road Zilu met an old man carrying a hoe and asked him,"Sir,have you seen my master?" The old man retorted,"You who never use your four limbs,who don't know the difference between the five grains—who is your master?”Planting his staff in the ground,he started weeding. Zilu went and told Confucius,who said,"He must be a recluse." They went back to find him but he had disappeared.

孔子迁于蔡三岁,吴伐陈。楚救陈，军于城父。闻孔子在陈、蔡之间，楚使人聘孔子。孔子将往拜礼,陈、蔡大夫谋曰：“孔子贤者，所刺讥皆中诸侯之疾。今者久留陈、蔡之间，诸大夫所设行皆非仲尼之意。今楚，大国也，来聘孔子。孔子用于楚，则陈、蔡用事大夫危矣。”于是乃相与发徒役围孔子于野。不得行，绝粮。从者病，莫能兴,孔子讲诵弦歌不衰。子路愠,见曰：“君子亦有穷乎四?”孔子曰：“君子固穷,小人穷斯滥矣。”子贡色作。孔子曰：“赐，尔以予为多学而识之者与?”曰：“然。非与?”孔子曰：“非也，予一以贯之。”
孔子到蔡国的第三年，吴国出兵伐陈。楚国派兵救陈，驻兵于城父。楚王听说孔子这时就在陈、蔡两国之间，于是就派人去请孔子。孔子准备前去拜见，陈、蔡两国的大夫们听到这个消息立刻商量：“孔子可是个能干的人，他对哪个国家所作的批评都能切中哪个国家的要害。近几年他住在我们陈、蔡两国之间，我们这些人的所作所为都不合乎孔子的思想。现在楚国这个大国来请孔子了。如果孔子在楚国被重用，那我们陈、蔡两国这些主事人可就危险了。”于是他们就串通起来发兵把孔子一行包围在陈、蔡之间的一片荒郊野地里，使得他们想走走不了，带的干粮也都吃完了，饿得那些随从的弟子们一个个都躺在地上，站不起来了。而孔子却还在那里讲诗书，读文章，弹琴唱歌不停。子路心里很恼怒地过来对孔子说：“君子难道也有走投无路的时候吗?”孔子说：“君子到了困窘的时候能够坚守节操，而小人到了困窘的时候就会不择手段地乱来了。”子贡也是一脸的不高兴。孔子说：“端木赐，你认为我是学了很多的东西能牢记不忘的人吗?”子贡说：“是的。难道您不是这样吗?”孔子说：“不是的，我是能用一个基本的思想把所学的东西贯穿起来。”
When Confucius had spent three years in Cai,Wu attacked Chen and Chu sent troops which were stationed at Chengfu to Chen's assistance.Learning that Confucius was living between Chen and Cai, the men ofChu sent him an invitation.Before he could accept it, however,the ministers of Chen and Cai discussed the matter and said, “Confucius is an able man who has laid his finger unerringly on the abuses in every state.He has spent a considerable time between Chen and Cai and disapproves of all our measures and policies.Now pow- erful Chu has sent for him.If he serves Chu,so much the worse for us!" They sent men to surround Confucius in the countryside,so that he could not leave.His supplies ran out,his followers were too weak to move,but Confucius wenton teaching and singing,accompanying him- self on the lute. Zilu went to him and asked indignantly,"Does a gentleman have to put up with privation?" “A gentleman can stand privation,”answered Confucius.“A mean man exposed to privation is prone to do wrong.” As Zigong looked displeased,Confucius asked him,"Doyou think me a learned,well-read man?” "Certainly,"replied Zigong."Aren't you?" "Not at all,"said Confucius."I have simply grasped one thread which links up the rest.”

孔子知弟子有愠心，乃召子路而问曰：“《诗》云‘匪兕匪虎，率彼旷野’。吾道非邪?吾何为于此?”子路曰：“意者吾未仁邪?人之不我信也。意者吾未知邪?人之不我行也。”孔子曰：“有是乎!由，譬使仁者而必信，安有伯夷、叔齐?使知者而必行，安有王子比干?”
孔子知道学生们都有怨气，于是把子路叫来问他说：“《诗何草不黄》里说‘既不是犀牛，又不是老虎，可是却整天在原野上东奔西跑’。是我追求的理想不对吗?我为什么落到了这步田地呢?”子路说：“也许是我们还没有达到仁人的标准，所以人们对我们还不够信任。也许是我们的聪明智慧还有欠缺，所以我们的仁道才不能畅行于世。”孔子说：“有你说的这种道理吗?仲由，要是凡够仁人标准的人就能让别人相信，那伯夷、叔齐还会饿死在首阳山吗?要是聪明智慧无欠缺的人就一定能使仁道通行无阻，那王子比干还会被剖腹挖心吗?”
Knowing that his disciples were in low spirits,Confucius called Zi- lu and said to him,"The old song runs:I am neither rhinoceros nor tiger,yet I go to the wilderness.'Is our way wrong?Is that why we have come to this?” "Maybe we lack humanity and therefore men do not trust us," replied Zilu.“Or perhaps we are not intelligent enough for them to follow our way.” "Do you really think so?"countered Confucius."If the humane were always trusted,how do you account for what happened to Bo Yi and Shu Qi?⁴If the intelligent always had their way,how do you ex- plain the case of Prince Bigan?”

子路出，子贡入见。孔子曰：“赐，《诗》云‘匪兕匪虎，率彼旷野’。吾道非邪?吾何为于此?”子贡曰：“夫子之道至大也,故天下莫能容夫子。夫子盖少贬焉?”孔子曰：“赐，良农能稼而不能为穑,良工能巧而不能为顺。君子能修其道，纲而纪之，统而理之,而不能为容。今尔不修尔道而求为容，赐，而志不远矣!”
子路出去后，子贡进来了。孔子说：“端木赐，《诗何草不黄》里说‘既不是犀牛，又不是老虎，可是却整天在原野里奔跑’。是我追求的理想不对吗?我为什么落到这步田地呢?”子贡说：“这是由于先生您的理想太高尚太伟大了，因此天下才无法容纳您。先生您难道就不能把标准降低点吗?”孔子说：“端木赐，最好的农民能保证把地种好，但不能保证就一定能获得丰收；最好的能工巧匠能保证把东西做得巧夺天工，但不能保证买东西的人一定满意；一个君子能够尽力使自己的理想趋于完善，能让它有条有理，一以贯之，但不能保证一定能让世人接受。现在你不是千方百计地去修养自己而是只想去取得世人的接纳，你的志向可不够远大!”
After Zilu left,Zigong came and Confucius put the same question to him."The old song says,I am neither thinoceros nor tiger,yet Igo to the wilderness.'Is our way wrong?Is that why we have come to this?” Zigong answered,"Master,your way is too great for the world to accept.You should modify it a little.” "A good farmer can sow but may not always reap a harvest,"said Confucius.“A good craftsman can use his skill but may not be able to please.Agentleman can cultivate his way,draw up principles,recapitu- late and reason,but may not be able to make his way accepted.Now your aim is not to cultivate your way but to please others.Your ambi- tion is not high enough."

子贡出，颜回入见。孔子曰：“回，《诗》云‘匪兕匪虎，率彼旷野’。吾道非邪?吾何为于此?”颜回曰：“夫子之道至大，故天下莫能容。虽然，夫子推而行之。不容何病,不容然后见君子!夫道之不修也，是吾丑也。夫道既已大修而不用，是有国者之丑也。不容何病，不容然后见君子!”孔子欣然而笑曰：“有是哉颜氏之子!使尔多财，吾为尔宰。”于是使子贡至楚,楚昭王兴师迎孔子,然后得免。
子贡出去后，颜回进去了。孔子说：“颜回，《诗何草不黄》里说‘既不是犀牛，又不是老虎，可是整天在原野里奔跑’。是我的理想不对吗?我为什么落到了这步田地呢?”颜回说：“先生的理想太伟大了，因此才使得天下哪里也无法容纳。尽管如此，先生您还是坚持不懈地在推行它，不被容纳又有什么关系呢，不被容纳才更显示出您作为君子的伟大!一个人的理想学说不完美，是自己的耻辱；如果理想学说完美无缺而只是不能被人容纳，那就是当权者们的羞耻了。不被容纳有什么关系，不被容纳才显示出您作为君子的伟大!”孔子一听称心地笑着说：“颜家的小子，可真有你的!假如你是个大富翁，我情愿去给你当管家。”后来孔子派子贡去向楚王报告了情况，楚昭王派兵来迎接孔子，孔子师徒一行才摆脱了困境。
After Zigong had left,Yan Hui came and Confucius again put the same question to him. "Master,your way is too great for the world to accept,"said Yan Hui.“All the same,you should persist in it.What does it matter if they cannot accept it?That just shows that you are a superior man.We are at fault if we do not cultivate the true way.Yet if we cultivate it fully and it is not adopted,it is the rulers who are at fault.What does it matter if they cannot accept your way?That just shows that you are a superior man.” Confucius smiled with pleasure and exclaimed,"Well said,son of Yan!If you had great wealth,I should like to administer it for you.” Then Confucius sent Zigong to Chu.King Zhao of Chu dispatched troops to meet him,and he was finally able to get away.

昭王将以书社地七百里封孔子,楚令尹子西曰:“王之使使诸侯有如子贡者乎?”曰：“无有。”“王之辅相有如颜回者乎?”曰：“无有。”“王之将率有如子路者乎?”曰：“无有。”“王之官尹有如宰予者乎?”曰：“无有。”“且楚之祖封于周,号为子男五十里。今孔丘述三五之法,明周召之业,王若用之，则楚安得世世堂堂方数千里乎?夫文王在丰，武王在镐，百里之君卒王天下。今孔丘得据土壤，贤弟子为佐，非楚之福也”。”昭王乃止。其秋，楚昭王卒于城父。
楚昭王打算把带有居民户籍的七百里地盘拨给孔子作封邑，这时楚国的令尹子西阻拦说：“大王您派往各国去的使者有像子贡那种善于外交辞令的吗?”昭王说：“没有。”子西说：“您的宰相有像颜回那么德才俱全的吗?”昭王说：“没有。”子西说：“您的武将有像子路那么勇猛的吗?”昭王说：“没有。”子西说：“您主管具体事务的官员有像宰予那么能	干的吗?”昭王说：“没有。”子西说：“楚国的祖先当初在周朝受封时，爵	位是子男一级，封地只有五十里。现在孔丘继承的是三王五帝的法则，所发扬的是周公、召公的传统，您要是用了他，那我们楚国还能够世世代代地享有这几千里的地盘吗?当初周文王经营丰邑，周武王建都镐京，都是凭着百里的地盘最后统一了天下。今天我们要是让孔丘有了七百里的地盘，再有那么多能干的弟子帮着他，那绝不是楚国的好事。”昭王一听也就打消了封孔子的念头。同年秋天，楚昭王在城父去世。
King Zhao of Chu was on the point of giving Confucius seven hundred liof village communities as his fief,when his chief minister Zixi asked,"Has Your Majesty any ambassador comparable to Zigong?” "No,"said the king. “Any minister comparable to Yan Hui?” Again the answer was,"No." “Any general comparable to Zilu?Any administrator comparable to Zai Yu?” Once again the answer was,"No." "When the founder of the House of Chu received his fief from the Zhou Dynasty,he had a low rank and only fifty liofland.Now Confucius is following the ways of the ancient kings to display the virtues of the duke of Zhou and the duke of Shao.If you entrust him with authority, sir,Chu will not keep these few thousand li for many generations.When King Wen was in Feng and King Wu in Hao,they were only princes with a hundred li of territory,but they rose to sovereignty of the whole empire.If Confucius with such able disciples to help him were to have land of his own,that would not be to our advantage."Accordingly King Zhao gave up the idea.And that autumn he died in Chengfu.

楚狂接舆歌而过孔子,曰：“凤兮凤兮，何德之衰!往者不可谏兮,来者犹可追也!已而已而,今之从政者殆而!”孔子下，欲与之言。趋而去，弗得与之言。于是孔子自楚反乎卫。是岁也，孔子年六十三，而鲁哀公六年也。
有一天孔子外出，一个叫接舆的狂人唱着歌在孔子的车旁走过，他唱道：“凤凰呀凤凰!你的品质为什么这样坏呀!已经过去的事是无法挽回的了，还是赶紧抓好自己的未来吧!算啦，算啦，今天的执政者们没有一个好东西!”孔子赶快下车，想跟他聊聊，可是他却一溜烟地走开了，孔子没能跟他说上话。不久孔子就从楚国回到了卫国。这一年孔子六十三岁,是鲁哀公六年。
The eccentric of Chu,Jie Yu,walked past Confucius singing: Ah,phoenix,phoenix, How powerless you are! Useless to blame what's done, Take thought for what's to come. Enough,enough! Today there is danger For those who guide the state. Confucius alighted from his carriage to speak to this man,but the eccentric ran off.Then Confucius went back from Chu to Wei.He was sixty-three this year,the sixth year of Duke Ai of Lu.

其明年,吴与鲁会缯,征百牢。太宰豁召季康子,康子使子贡往，然后得已。
孔子回鲁国后的第二年，吴王与鲁哀公在缯邑会谈，吴国要求鲁国备办百牢的大礼。吴国的太宰伯磊叫鲁国的宰相季康子去面谈，季康子派子贡去了，经过子贡的据理力争，事情才得以了结。
The next year the king of Wu and the duke of Lu met at Zeng and the king demanded a hundred oxen.Chancellor Bo Pi of Wu sum- monedJi Kangzi,who sent Zigong in his place.Then Wu dropped its demand.

孔子曰：“鲁卫之政，兄弟也。”是时，卫君辄父不得立,在外，诸侯数以为让。而孔子弟子多仕于卫,卫君欲得孔子为政。子路曰：“卫君待子而为政，子将奚先?”孔子曰：“必也正名乎!”子路曰：“有是哉，子之迂也!何其正也?”孔子曰：“野哉由也!夫名不正则言不顺，言不顺则事不成，事不成则礼乐不兴，礼乐不兴则刑罚不中,刑罚不中则民无所错手足矣。夫君子为之必可名,言之必可行。君子于其言，无所苟而已矣。”
孔子说：“鲁国和卫国的政治局势，就像亲哥俩，好坏差不多。”这时候，卫出公辄的父亲蒯聩正流亡在外没有被立，各个国家常拿这件事情谴责卫国。而孔子的弟子们多数人当时正在卫国做事，因此卫出公也很想把孔子本人请了去。有一天子路问孔子说：“卫君正准备请您出去治理国家，如果您去了第一件准备先干什么?”孔子说：“第一件先要正名。”子路说：“真是的，您可真够迂腐!现在还有什么可正的?”孔子说：“仲由，你也太粗野了!名不正就言不顺，言不顺事情就办不成，事情办不成就没法制礼作乐，礼乐搞不好刑罚也就不能很好地运用，刑罚运用不好那黎民百姓就不知道什么该干，什么不该干了。因此君子不论办什么事，一定得要讲出个名堂；他所讲出的话，一定要能够付诸实行。因此君子对于自己的言论，是绝对不能有丝毫马虎的。”
Confucius said,"The rulers ofLu and Wei are like two brothers." At this time Duke Zhefu of Wei had not succeeded to power but was staying in another state.The other feudal lords regarded him as having abdicated.Since most of Confucius'disciples were serving Wei, the duke wanted him to join the government too. Zilu asked,"If the duke of Wei urged you to govern his state, what would you do first?" "I would rectify titles,"said Confucius. "You are very unpractical,"said Zilu."Why are you so set on rec- tifying titles?” Confucius retorted,"What a savage you are!If titles are incorrect, orders will not be carried out;and if orders are not carried out,then nothing can be achieved.Thatmeans that rites andmusicwill not flourish, laws and punishments will be wide of the mark,and people will not know what to do.Agentleman's actions must be such as he can name; he must promise only what he can perform.A gentleman must keep careful watch on his speech.“”

其明年,冉有为季氏将师与齐战于郎,克之。季康子曰：“子之于军旅，学之乎?性之乎?”冉有曰：“学之于孔子。”季康子曰：“孔子何如人哉?”对曰：“用之有名，播之百姓，质诸鬼神而无憾。求之至于此道,虽累千社，夫子不利也。”康子曰：“我欲召之，可乎?”对曰：“欲召之，则毋以小人固之,则可矣。”而卫孔文子将攻太叔,问策于仲尼"。仲尼辞不知,退而命载而行,曰：“鸟能择木，木岂能择鸟乎!”文子固止。会季康子使公华、公宾、公林以币迎孔子，孔子归鲁。孔子之去鲁凡十四岁而反乎鲁。
第二年，冉有为季孙氏统领部队，在鲁国的郎亭与齐国作战，获得了胜利。季康子问冉有说：“您这份指挥作战的才能，是学来的呢?还是天生的呢?”冉有说：“是跟着孔子学的。”季康子说：“孔子是一个什么样的人呢?”冉有说：“孔子如果用兵那一定是师出有名，他的所作所为都可以讲给百姓们听，都可以摆给鬼神们看，而保险不会有任何欠缺。像我现在所做的这些事情，我想您即使拿两万五千家的封地去吸引他，他也不会为了这点利益来做这些事的。”季康子说：“我想把他请回鲁国来，行吗?”冉有说：“您如果想请他回来，那就绝不能把他当成小人对待。这样也许还可以。”过后不久，卫国的孔文子准备攻击卫国的另一个贵族太叔，孔文子向孔子讨教。孔子婉转地推说自己不懂这方面的事情，说罢立即叫人们收拾行装准备离开卫国，他说：“只能够由鸟来选择树木，难道还能叫树木来选择鸟吗!”孔文子听说后，坚决请他留下来。这时正赶上季康子派了公华、公宾、公林几个人，带着礼物来卫国迎孔子，于是孔子便返回了鲁国。孔子从离开鲁国去各国游历，到这次回来，前后共经历了十四个年头。
The following year Ran You,given the command of the army by Ji Kangzi,defeated Qi at Lang. "Have you studied the arts of war?”Ji Kangzi asked him.“Or are you naturally gifted?” Ran You replied,"I learned this from Confucius." "What kind of man is he?" "He wants his actions to correspond to his principles.In applying his principles to govern the people he tries to carry out the wishes of the gods.This is what he wants,not to possess wealth to the value of a thousand villages.” “Could I ask him back?” "If you do,you must not let petty-minded men obstruct him." At that time Kong Wenzi of Wei planned to attack Taishu and asked Confucius for a plan of campaign,but Confucius declined on the ground that this was beyond him.Upon withdrawing he ordered his carriage,saying,“The bird chooses its tree;the tree cannot choose the bird."However,Kong Wenzi prevailed on him to stay.Then Ji Kangzi sent Gonghua,Gongbin and Gonglin with gifts to invite Confucius back to Lu.He had been away from the state for fourteen years.

鲁哀公问政，对曰：“政在选臣。”季康子问政，曰：“举直错诸枉，则枉者直。”康子患盗，孔子曰：“苟子之不欲，虽赏之不窃。”然鲁终不能用孔子，孔子亦不求仕。
回来后，鲁哀公向孔子询问如何治理国家，孔子说：“关键在于选好大臣。”接着宰相季康子也向孔子询问如何治理国家，孔子说：“提拔正派的人，罢免邪门歪道的人，这样，其他邪门歪道的人也就会逐渐变好了。”季康子担心盗贼为患，孔子说：“如果你自己首先带头不贪财，那么即使你鼓励人家去偷，人家也不去。”但鲁国最后也还是没有任用孔子，而孔子自己也没有主动地提出要求。
Asked about government by Duke Ai of Lu,he replied,"The art lies in choosing your ministers well."" Asked about government byJi Kangzi,he answered,"If you use the straight in place of the crooked,the crooked will become straight.” Ji Kangzi was troubled by some cases of theft.Confucius said,"If you yourself were free from desire,they would not steal even if you paid them to do so.”However,as it turned out Lu did not employ him and Confucius did not ask for an official post.

孔子之时，周室微而礼乐废，《诗》、《书》缺。追迹三代之礼,序《书传》,上纪唐虞之际,下至秦缪,编次其事。曰：“夏礼吾能言之，杞不足征也。殷礼吾能言之，宋不足征也。足，则吾能征之矣。”观殷、夏所损益,曰：“后虽百世可知也，以一文一质。”“周监二代，郁郁乎文哉，吾从周。”故《书传》、《礼记》自孔氏。
在孔子生活的那个年代，周王朝已经非常衰弱了，当时礼崩乐坏，《诗》、《书》也都残缺不全。于是孔子就一方面考查夏、商、周三代的礼乐制度，一方面整理《尚书》的遗文，他把上起唐尧、虞舜，下至秦缪公的所有的《尚书》篇章，都编排了起来。他说：“夏代的礼仪我还是能讲的，但现在杞国的礼仪我就不太相信。殷代的礼仪我也是能讲的，但现代宋国的礼仪我也不太相信。因为他们的依据都不足，如果有足够的依据，那我就可以相信、吸取了。”孔子研究了殷、夏两代礼仪方面的发展变化后，推论说：“往后再过一百辈子的礼仪是什么样，现在我也能够知道了，其实就是一文一质，交互使用。”“而周朝的礼仪是借鉴了夏、殷两代的经验而制定的，它最隆盛，最丰富多彩。我是赞成周朝的。”后人诵读的《尚书》和《礼记》都是经孔子整理编定的。
During the time of Confucius the House of Zhou had declined, the ancient rites and music were forgotten,and many of the songs and records were missing.He verified the rites of the Three Dynasties and compiled the Book of Documents,arranging the records chronologically from the time of Yao and Shun to that of Duke Mu of Qin,marshal- ling the facts in good order.He said,"I can speak about the rites of Xia,but the records of Qi are too scanty to verify.I can speak about the rites of Yin,but the records of Song are too scanty to verify.Had they been complete,I should have been able to check them."With regard to the differences in the Shang and Xia cultures,he declared, “Far removed as we are in time,we can still tell that one culture was elaborate,the other simple.Zhou,which learned from both,reached a pinnacle of culture.I follow.Zhou." Thus both the Book of Documents and the Book of Rites were com- piled by Confucius.

孔子语鲁大师:“乐其可知也,始作翕如,纵之纯如，噭如，绎如也,以成。”“吾自卫反鲁，然后乐正，《雅》、《颂》各得其所。”
孔子对鲁国的乐官说：“音乐的演奏规律是可以掌握的，开始时各种音响要非常协调，随着音调的展开声音要和谐悦耳，要顿挫鲜明，要悠扬回荡，一直到结束。”孔子还说：“我从卫国返回鲁国后，就开始对乐曲进行审定，使《雅》乐和《颂》乐都各自发挥了它们应发挥的作用。”
He told the chief.musician of Lu,"As far as we know,music started with strict unison.Then more licence was allowed,but it has remained pure,clear and consistent to the end.Since my return from Wei to Lu,I have set right the music and arranged the odes and hymns in proper order."

古者《诗》三千余篇，及至孔子，去其重，取可施于礼义,上采契、后稷,中述殷周之盛,至幽厉之缺,始于衽席,故曰“《关雎》之乱以为《风》始,《鹿鸣》为《小雅》始,《文王》为《大雅》始,《清庙》为《颂》始”。三百五篇孔子皆弦歌之，以求合《韶》、《武》、《雅》、《颂》之音。礼乐自此可得而述,以备王道,成六艺。
古代流传下来的诗大约有三千多篇，孔子删掉了那些重复的，选出了那些可以用来对人们进行礼义教育的，最早的有歌颂殷契、后稷的诗篇，接着有称述殷、周两代繁荣兴盛的诗篇，接着还有批评周厉王、周幽王道德衰败的诗篇，而编排的顺序又首先是从夫妻之间的关系开始的。所以说“《关雎》是《国风》的开篇，《鹿鸣》是《小雅》的开篇，《文王》是《大雅》的开篇，《清庙》是《颂》的开篇”。孔子给选出来的这三百零五篇古诗都一一地配上了乐谱，让它们和《韶》乐、《武》乐、《雅》乐、《颂》乐相一致。有关音乐的发展历史从此有了一个大致的轮廓，而这是实行王道所不可缺少的，是六艺中的一艺。
There were more than three thousand ancient songs,but Confucius rejected those which were repetitious and retained those which had moral value,beginning with songs about the ancestors of Shang and Zhou,going on to descriptions of the good reigns of both dynasties and thence to the misdeeds of King You and King Li.He put the poems about daily life first,starting the folk-song section with the Song of the Dove,the Lesser Odes with The Deer Cries,the Greater Odes with King Wen and the Hymns with the Temple of Purity.Confucius chose three hundred and five songs in all;and these he set to music and sang, fitting them to the music of Emperor Shun and King Wu.After that the old rites and music became widely known,to the enrichment of the kingly culture,and the Six Classics were established.

孔子晚而喜《易》,序《彖》、《系》、《象》、《说卦》、《文言》。读《易》,韦编三绝。曰：“假我数年，若是，我于《易》则彬彬矣。”
孔子到了晚年特别喜欢《周易》,他为《周易》写了《序卦》、《彖辞》、《系辞》、《象辞》、《说卦》、《文言》等著作。由于他不停地翻读《周易》,以至于那些串连竹简的皮条都断了好几次。他还遗憾地说：“要是能够再多给我几年时间，我对于《周易》也就能领会得更透彻、更深入了。”
In his old age Confucius loved to study the Book of Change,the order of the hexagrams,definitions,appendices,interpretations,expla- nations and commentaries.Hestudied this book so much that theleather thongs binding the wooden strips wore out three times.“Give me a few years more,"he said,"and I shall become quite proficient!"

孔子以《诗》、《书》、《礼》、《乐》教，弟子盖三千焉,身通六艺者七十有二人。如颜浊邹之徒，颇受业者甚众。
孔子把诗、书、礼、乐作为教育弟子的主要内容，受过孔子教育的弟子大概有三千人，其中对于六艺样样精通的有七十二个。像颜浊邹那样受过孔子的一些教育而不算正式弟子的人就更多了。
Confucius taught his pupils the old songs,records,rites and music. In all he had three thousand pupils,seventy-two of whom were versed inall Six Arts.Many more,like Yan Zhuozou,also received instruction from him.

孔子以四教：文，行，忠，信。绝四：毋意，毋必，毋固，毋我。所慎：齐，战，疾。子罕言利与命与仁。不愤不启,举一隅不以三隅反，则弗复也。
孔子从文、行、忠、信四方面教育学生。他还要学生杜绝四种弊端，这就是不要凭空猜测，不要先入为主武断是非，不要固执己见，不要固步自封。他要求弟子们要小心谨慎地对待三件事：这就是斋戒、战争和疾病。孔子很少谈论利益、天命和仁德这三个问题。在教育方法上他还主张，在学生自己没有进行艰苦的思考之前，不要过早地启发他，对于那些不知举一反三的学生，就不必再教育他。
In his teaching Confucius laid emphasis on four things:culture, conduct,loyalty and honesty.Four things he avoided:foregone conclusions,arbitrary views,obstinacy and egoism.He advocated cau- tion during sacrifice,war and sickness.He rarely spoke of profit,fate or goodness.He would only help those who were in earnest.If he gave one corner of a square and the pupil could not infer the other three corners,he would not repeat his explanation.

其于乡党,恂恂似不能言者。其于宗庙朝廷，辩辩言，唯谨尔。朝，与上大言，闾闾如也;与下大夫言，侃侃如也。
孔子在自己的乡亲邻舍之间，总是表现出一种温和恭顺的样子，就像不会说话一样。他在国家的宗庙里和朝廷上，说话流利清晰，态度非常谨慎。他在朝廷上跟上大夫说话，总是表现出一种正直而又恭敬的样子，与下大夫说话，总是表现一种和颜悦色而又轻松愉快的样子。
In his native village his manner was unassuming,as though he did not trust himself to speak.But in the ancestral temple or at court his speech was ordered,and he chose his words with care.

入公门,鞠躬如也;趋进，翼如也。君召使侯,色勃如也。君命召，不俟驾行矣。
孔子每当进入宫廷的大门时，总要低着头弯着腰一副恭敬小心的样子；每当他快步趋进时，也总是恭恭敬敬的；当听到国君叫他去接待宾客，他的脸色立刻就会变得庄重起来；当他在家里一旦听到国君的召唤，他就会等不得套好车子就徒步奔向朝廷。
At court he addressed high ministers firmly,low officials affably.Entering the gate of a public office he bowed his head,and advancing in haste he spread his sleeves gracefully.Summoned by a prince to accompany guests,he bore himself gravely;and at a summons from his lord he set off with- out waiting for his carriage.

鱼馁，肉败，割不正，不食。席不正，不坐。食于有丧者之侧，未尝饱也。
腐烂的鱼，变味的肉，或者好鱼好肉而没按规定的方式切的，他都通通不吃。席位摆得不正，他就不坐。身边只要有穿丧服的人他吃饭就从来不曾吃饱。
He would not eat fish that was not fresh,meat that was high or anything carelessly cut.He would not sit on a mat that was not straight. In the company of a man in mourning he would not eat his fill.

是日哭，则不歌。见齐衰、瞽者，虽童子必变。
他只要在这一天里哭过，就再也不会在这一天里唱歌了。他见到穿孝服的人以及双目失明的人，即使那是一个小孩他也会立刻表现出一种怜悯同情的样子。
On the day that he attended a funeral he would not sing.Deep mourning or blindness,even in a child,always made him grave.

“三人行，必得我师。”“德之不修，学之不讲,闻义不能徙,不善不能改，是吾忧也。”
他说过：“只要三个人一起走路，其中就至少有一个人可以作我的老师。”他还说：“品德不够格，书念得不好，见到别人做好事，自己不能学；见到别人有毛病自己不知道警惕，这些是我最担心的。”
"When three walk together,there must be one who can teach me," said Confucius."Failure to cultivate virtue,to perfect my knowledge, to change when I hear what is right and to correct my faults—these are the things that worry me.”

使人歌，善，则使复之，然后和之。
孔子让人唱歌时，如果唱得好，他就让人家再唱一遍，他自己也跟着人家的声音一起唱。
When he invited men to sing and found the song good,he would ask for a repetition and join in himself.

子不语怪，力，乱，神。
孔子绝口不谈怪异、暴力、叛乱、鬼神这四个方面的问题。
The subjects on which he did not talk were:extraordinary things, feats of strength,political disorders,and the supernatural.

子贡曰：“夫子之文章可得闻也;夫子言天道与性命，弗可得闻也已。”
子贡说：“我们先生关于诗、书、礼、乐方面的论述，我听他讲过。关于天道性命方面的问题，我没有听他说过。”
Zigong once said,"We can hear the master's views concerning culture,but he does not tell us anything about Nature and Fate."

颜渊喟然叹曰：“仰之弥高，钻之弥坚，瞻之在前，忽焉在后。夫子循循然善诱人,博我以文,约我以礼,欲罢不能。既竭我才，如有所立，卓尔，虽欲从之，蔑由也已。”
颜渊无限敬佩地说：“我们先生的思想人格，我是仰着脸越看越高，越钻越觉得钻研不透，一会儿觉得就在眼前，一会儿又觉得像在身后。先生对我们的那种循序渐进地诱导，那种极大程度地让我们扩大知识面，同时又用礼仪来约束规范我们，使得我们即使想停下来都不能。我们已经用尽了全部才力，而那个卓越高大的目标还是耸立在我们前面，使得我们能够向前靠近它，但却没有办法达到它。”
And Yan Hui once said with a sigh,"The more I look up,the higher is his teaching above me.The deeper I probe,the harder it becomes.One moment I think I have it,but the next it eludes me again. How skilfully,step by step,the master leads us on!He has broadened me with culture,restrained me with ritual.Even if I wanted to,I could not stop.I go all out,yet just as I think I am achieving something,he is far beyond me again.I want to follow,but cannot find the way.”

达巷党人曰:“大哉孔子，博学而无所成名。”子闻之曰：“我何执?执御乎?执射乎?我执御矣。”牢曰:“子云：‘不试故艺。'”
达巷有人评论孔子说：“孔子可真是伟大啊!他的知识非常渊博，但却又让人没法说清他究竟是属于哪一家。”孔子听到这个议论后说：“我干的是哪一行呢?是赶大车呢?还是射箭呢?大概还是赶车吧。”他的弟子子牢说：“我们先生说过：‘我是因为没有被国家任用，所以才学了这些玩意。'"
A villager of Daxiang remarked,“Confucius is truly great,known for his wide knowledge,but not for any special skill." When Confucius heard this he asked,"What shall I take up? Charioteering or archery?I choose charioteering.” Qin Lao commented,"The master said he learned many arts be- cause he never held office."

鲁哀公十四年春,狩大野。叔孙氏车子钽商获兽,以为不祥。仲尼视之，曰：“麟也。”取之。曰：“河不出图，雒不出书，吾已矣夫!”颜渊死，孔子曰：“天丧予!”及西狩见麟，曰：“吾道穷矣!”喟然叹曰：“莫知我夫!"子贡曰：“何为莫知子?”子曰：“不怨天，不尤人,下学而上达,知我者其天乎!”
鲁哀公十四年春天，哀公带着人在大野泽打猎，这时叔孙氏的乘车武士商钽捕获了一只奇怪的野兽，人们都认为是不祥之兆。孔子听说后去看，说：“这是一只麒麟啊。”于是他就把它要了回来。孔子早就说过：“黄河里没再出现图，雒水里也没再出现书，看起来我这辈子大概是没什么希望了!”后来颜渊一死，孔子更伤感地说：“老天爷这下子可真要了我的命了!”等到他这回再见到这只被捉的麒麟，就绝望地说：“这回我的确再无路可走了!”他伤心地叹息说：“没有人了解我呀!”子贡说：“为什么说没有人了解您呢?”孔子说：“我是上不怨天，下不怨人，我从最基础的东西学起，越学越高深，了解我的，看来只有老天爷喽!”
In the spring of the fourteenth year of Duke Aiof Lu there was a great hunt at Daye,and Shusun's charioteer Chu Shang caught a crea- ture which he thought was ill-omened.Confucius seeing it exclaimed, “This is a unicorn!"He took it back,saying,"No chart has come out of the Yellow River,no writings from the River Luo.8All is over with me."When Yan Hui died Confucius had cried,"Heaven has forsaken me!“”And now that this unicorn was captured in the west,he exclaimed, "My way has come to an end!”Sighing,he lamented,"Nobody under- stands me.”Zigong asked,“Why does nobody understand you?” Confucius said,"I bear no grudge against Heaven nor do I blame men.I learn from below and try to reach above,but only Heaven can understand me.

子曰：“不降其志，不辱其身,伯夷、叔齐乎!”谓：“柳下惠、少连降志辱身矣。”谓：“虞仲、夷逸隐居放言,行中清,废中权。”“我则异于是,无可无不可。”
孔子说过：“能够不降低自己的意志，不辱没自己身份的，大概只有伯夷叔齐吧!”他又说：“至于柳下惠和少连，那就降低了自己的意志，辱没自己的身份了。”他又说：“虞仲和夷逸能够避世隐居，任性直言，他们的操行够得上廉洁，他们的自告废弃，也合乎权宜之计。”“而我则与他们上述两种人都不同，对于我来说没有表面上的这种行或者不行。”
Confucius said,"Bo Yi and Shu Qi held fast by their principles and would not debase themselves,whereas Liuxia Hui and Shao Lian sur- rendered their principles and debased themselves.Then there were Yu Zhong and Yi Yi who held aloof as recluses and spoke their mind. They would not serve a government unless it was incorrupt and re- signed from office whenever expedient.Iam not like these men:I have no such scruples."

子曰：“弗乎弗乎,君子病没世而名不称焉。吾道不行矣,吾何以自见于后世哉?”乃因作《春秋》,上至隐公,下讫哀公十四年,十二公。据鲁，亲周，故殷，运之三代。约其文辞而指博。故吴楚之君自称王，而《春秋》贬之曰“子”;践土之会实召周天子，而《春秋》讳之曰“天王狩于河阳”:推此类以绳当世，贬损之义,后有王者举而开之。《春秋》之义行，则天下乱臣贼子惧焉。
孔子说：“不是吗，不是吗?君子可不能死了之后名不传于后世呀。我的理想肯定是不能实现了，那我还能靠着什么扬名后世呢?”于是他就依据鲁国的历史资料写了一部《春秋》,这部书上起鲁隐公元年，下至鲁哀公十四年，一共记载了鲁国十二代诸侯之间的天下大事。这部书以鲁国历史为依据，以赞美周朝为宗旨，借鉴殷朝的制度，贯通夏商周三代的历史变化。它的文辞简洁，意义却极为广博。吴国、楚国的国君自己胆大称王，而孔子在《春秋》里却把他们贬称为“子”;践土会盟，事实上是晋文公召唤周天子去的，而孔子在《春秋》里却为周天子粉饰，说是“天王到河阳去打猎”,孔子就是运用这样的写法，来为当世立一种是非的准绳。他所以要使用这种批判抨击的手段，目的就是为了让后世的君主们能够开卷有益。《春秋》的思想如果能够得到推行，那么普天下的乱臣贼子就要害怕了。
The master said,“Alas!Alas!What a gentleman dreads is to die before his name is known.My way is not popular.How shall I make myself known to later ages?” Then he compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals based on the his- torical records of twelve reigns,from that of Duke Yin down to the fourteenth year of the reign of Duke Ai.In this book Lu is given the predominant position,Zhou is considered worthy of respect,Shang is relegated to the past,and the spirit of the Three Dynasties is used as a guiding principle.The language is concise,the content profound.Though the rulers of Wu and Chu had styled themselves kings,the Spring and Autumn Annals criticizes them by calling them barons.Although the duke of Jin actually summoned the king of Zhou to a meeting at Jiantu,the Spring and Autumn Annals records that “the Great King went to hunt at Heyang”.These examples can be used as criteria in any age to criticize or condemn men's actions,and later princes should uphold this tradition and broaden its application.When the principles of the Spring and Autumn Annals are carried out,all traitors and evil-doers in the world must tremble.

孔子在位听讼,文辞有可与人共者，弗独有也。至于为《春秋》,笔则笔，削则削,子夏之徒不能赞一辞。弟子受《春秋》,孔子曰：“后世知丘者以《春秋》,而罪丘者亦以《春秋》。”
孔子在鲁国任司寇断案时，有些判辞的措辞常常和其他人一同商量，个人并不专断。至于写《春秋》,凡是他认为该写的就一定写，该删的就一定删，即使像子夏等这些以文章善长的学生也不能给他改动一个字。他的弟子们都要跟着他学《春秋》,他说：“后代赏识我的人将是根据这部《春秋》,批评我的人也将是根据这部《春秋》。”
When Confucius as a government official tried a case,he used the common speech and not distinctive language.But in editing the Spring and Autumn Annals he recorded certain events and omitted others so that not even men like Zixia could make any comment.The disciples of Confucius studied the Spring and Autumn Annal under him, and he said,"It is these annals by which later men will know me,and it is these annals which will make men condemn me.”

明岁,子路死于卫。孔子病，子贡请见。孔子方负杖逍遥于门,曰：“赐，汝来何其晚也?”孔子因叹，歌曰：“太山坏乎!梁柱摧乎!哲人萎乎!”因以涕下。谓子贡曰：“天下无道久矣，莫能宗予。夏人殡于东阶,周人于西阶，殷人两柱间。昨暮予梦坐奠两柱之间,予始殷人也。”后七日卒。
第二年，子路死在卫国。当时孔子也正有病，子贡来看孔子。孔子正拄着拐杖在门外散心，他一见子贡就说：“端木赐，你来得为什么这么晚啊?”随即他感慨地唱道：“泰山崩塌了!梁柱折断了!哲人枯萎了!”随着歌声他的眼泪也往下流。接着他又对子贡说：“天下无道已经多少年了，没有一个人尊重我的主张。夏朝人死了，灵柩是停在东面的台阶上；周朝人死了，灵柩是停在西面的台阶上；殷朝人死了，灵柩是停在正堂两根柱子的中间。昨天晚上我梦见自己坐在正堂两根柱子的中间享受祭奠，我本来就是殷朝人的后代啊。”七天以后孔子就死了。
The next year Zilu died in Wei and Confucius fell ill.When Zigong went to see him,the master,pacing by the door with a stick,demanded, “Why have you come so late?”Then he sighed and sang: Mount Tai crumbles, The great beam breaks, The wise man withers away With tears he told Zigong,"The world has long strayed from the true way and no one can follow me.The men of Xia mourned the dead by the east steps,the men of Zhou by the west steps,while the men of Yin mourned between pillars.Last night I dreamed that I was sitting before offerings between two pillars.It follows that I must be a man of Yin.”He died seven days later.

孔子年七十三，以鲁哀公十六年四月己丑卒。哀公课之曰:“旻天不吊,不憋遗一老,俾屏余一人以在位,茕茕余在疚。呜呼哀哉!尼父,毋自律!”子贡曰：“君其不没于鲁乎!夫子之言曰：‘礼失则昏，名失则愆。失志为昏，失所为愆四。’生不能用，死而课之，非礼也；称‘余一人’,非名也。”
孔子是在鲁哀公十六年夏历二月初十死的，终年七十三岁。鲁哀公给孔子写的诛文说：“老天爷不可怜我，连这么个老人也不给我留下，把我一个人甩在这个位子上，孤孤单单地痛苦着。太让人伤心啦!仲尼老人，今后我自己无法树立法度了!”子贡一听哀公的悼词说：“我们这位国君今后可能不会得到善终!先生曾经讲过：‘一个人要是在礼仪上有缺失，他的头脑就要昏乱；要是在名分上有缺失，他的行动就要出现过错。所谓昏乱，就是不能正常地思考问题；所谓过错就是所作所为都不合规矩。'活着的时候不能用人家，等到人家死了又来说好话，这不合乎礼仪。而且他还自称‘余一人’,这也是不合乎他的名分的。”
At the age of seventy-three,on the jichou day of the fourth month of the sixteenth year of Duke Ai ofLu.9 Duke Ai,mourning Confucius,said,“Kind Heaven had no pity on me and would not spare this grand old man.I am left alone in the world,full of grief and sorrow.Oh,master,to whom shall I look for guidance now?” Zigong commented,"The duke shall die in an alien land.The mas- ter said that lack of ceremony is folly,the misuse of designations a fault.To abandon your principles is also folly,to forget your place a fault.Not to employ the master during his lifetime but to mourn him after death runs counter to true ceremony,while the description‘alone in the world'does not befit a duke."

孔子葬鲁城北泗上,弟子皆服三年。三年心丧毕，相诀而去，则哭，各复尽哀；或复留。唯子贡庐于冢上,凡六年然后去。弟子及鲁人往从冢而家者百有余室,因命曰孔里。鲁世世相传以岁时奉祠孔子冢,而诸儒亦讲礼乡饮、大射于孔子家。孔子家大一顷,故所居堂弟子内,后世因庙，藏孔子衣冠琴车书,至于汉二百余年不绝。高皇帝过鲁，以太牢祠焉。诸侯卿相至,常先谒然后从政。
孔子死后埋在了鲁国都城北面的泗水旁边，弟子们都在那里为他守了三年孝。三年守孝完毕，大家就要分别各自回去了，临行前大家又哭了一回，都哭得非常悲哀。事后还有的继续在那里留着。尤其是子贡，他在孔子的坟墓旁边塔了一个草棚，前后在那里住了六年，而后才离去。孔子的弟子和其他鲁国人，自愿搬到孔子的坟墓旁边去住的有一百多家，于是人们就称这片地方为孔里。这个地区的人们世代相传每年每季总要按时到孔子的墓前去进行祭扫。儒生们也常到孔子的故居来举行乡饮、乡射一类的礼仪。孔子的故居有一顷多地。孔子的故居以及他的弟子们住过的屋子，后代就把它改作了庙，里面收藏着孔子的衣帽，琴书，车仗。到汉朝建国，孔子已经死去两百多年了，而人们的祭祀一直不绝。汉高祖在经过鲁国的时候，也用了太牢的祭品去祭祀孔子。受封到这个地区来上任的诸侯卿相们，一下车总是先要来拜谒孔子的祠庙而后再履行政务。
Confucius was buried by the River Si north of the city of Lu,and after his pupils had mourned for him for three years without wearing the customary mourning they bade each other farewell.But then they wept and mourned again,and some stayed longer at the grave.Zi- gong alone built a hut beside the grave and stayed there for three more years.Because more than a hundred of Confucius'disciples and other men of Lu settled near the grave,the district was named Confucius Village.The custom of sacrificing at the sage's grave during festivals has persisted from generation to generation.Scholars discuss ceremony there,while village feasts and archery contests are held there.His grave- yard covers over a hundred mu.The house in which he lived was made into a temple by the descendants of some of his disciples,and there his clothes,hat,lute,carriage and books were kept.The place still existed more than two hundred years later,in the Han Dynasty.When the First Emperor of Han passed Lu,he offered a grand sacrifice there.Barons and ministers appointed to posts there pay homage to the shrine of Confucius before taking up their duties.

太史公曰：《诗》有之：“高山仰止，景行行止。”虽不能至，然心乡往之。余读孔氏书，想见其为人。适鲁，观仲尼庙堂车服礼器，诸生以时习礼其家，余祗回留之不能去云。天下君王至于贤人众矣，当时则荣，没则已焉；孔子布衣，传十余世,学者宗之。自天子王侯，中国言“六艺”者折中于夫子,可谓至圣矣!
太史公说：《诗经》里说过：“高山哪，让人仰望。大路啊，让人奔驰。”即使我达不到那样的境界，但我总向往着那个伟大的目标。每当我一读孔子的书时，心里总是想象着他的为人。我曾经到过鲁国，我参观过孔子庙里陈列着的那些车子、衣帽、礼器等，那里的儒生们都按时到孔子的故居去演习礼仪。我见了那种场面也不由得为之流连徘徊，久久地舍不得离去。自古以来出色的君主贤人也很多了，但他们大多数都是活着的时候非常显赫，而死了以后也就悄无声息了。唯有孔子，活着的时候是一个平民百姓，死去已经十几代了，而学者们至今把他奉为祖师爷。现在上起天子王侯，所有中国讲“六经”的人都把孔子的言论作为衡量一切的标准，真可以算得上是至高无上的圣人了!
The Grand Historian comments:One of the songs says,"The great mountain,Ilook up to it!The great road,I travel it!"Although I cannot reach him,my heart goes out to him.When I read the works of Confucius,I try to see the man himself.In LuI visited his temple and saw his carriage,clothes and sacrificial vessels.Scholars go regularly to study ceremony there,and I found it hard to tear myself away.The world has known innumerable princes and worthies who enjoyed fame and honour in their day but were forgotten after death,while Confucius, a commoner,has been looked up to by scholars for ten generations and more.From the emperor,princes and barons downwards,all in China who study the Six Arts take the master as their final authority. Well is he called the Supreme Sage!sss
