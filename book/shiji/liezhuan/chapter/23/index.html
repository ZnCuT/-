          <div class="txt">范雎者,魏人也，字叔。游说诸侯，欲事魏王，家贫无以自资,乃先事魏中大夫须贾。

须贾为魏昭王使于齐,范雎从。留数月，未得报。齐襄王闻雎辩口,乃使人赐雎金十斤及牛酒，雎辞谢不敢受。须贾知之，大怒，以为雎持魏国阴事告齐，故得此馈，令雎受其牛酒，还其金。既归，心怒雎，以告魏相。魏相，魏之诸公子,曰魏齐。魏齐大怒，使舍人笞击雎，折胁摺齿。雎详死,即卷以箦,置厕中。宾客饮者醉，更溺雎,故缪辱以惩后,令无妄言者四。雎从箦中谓守者曰：“公能出我，我必厚谢公。”守者乃请出弃箦中死人。魏齐醉，曰：“可矣。”范雎得出。后魏齐悔，复召求之。魏人郑安平闻之，乃遂操范雎亡,伏匿，更名姓曰张禄。

当此时，秦昭王使谒者王稽于魏。郑安平诈为卒，侍王稽。王稽问：“魏有贤人可与俱西游者乎?”郑安平曰：“臣里中有张禄先生，欲见君言天下事。其人有仇，不敢昼见。”王稽曰：“夜与俱来。”郑安平夜与张禄见王稽。语未究,王稽知范雎贤，谓曰：“先生待我于三亭之南。”与私约而去。

王稽辞魏去，过载范雎入秦。至湖,望见车骑从西来。范雎曰：“彼来者为谁?”王稽曰：“秦相穰侯东行县邑。”范雎曰：“吾闻穰侯专秦权，恶内诸侯客,此恐辱我，我宁且匿车中。”有顷，穰侯果至，劳王稽,因立车而语曰:“关东有何变?”曰：“无有。”又谓王稽曰：“谒君得无与诸侯客子俱来乎?无益，徒乱人国耳。”王稽曰：“不敢。”即别去。范雎曰：“吾闻穰侯智士也，其见事迟，乡者疑车中有人,忘索之。”于是范雎下车走，曰：“此必悔之。”行十余里，果使骑还索车中四，无客，乃已。王稽遂与范雎入咸阳。

已报使,因言曰：“魏有张禄先生，天下辩士也。曰‘秦王之国危于累卵，得臣则安。然不可以书传也’。臣故载来。”秦王弗信，使舍食草具。待命岁余。

当是时，昭王已立三十六年。南拔楚之鄢郢,楚怀王幽死于秦。秦东破齐。滑王尝称帝，后去之。数困三晋。厌天下辩士，无所信。

穰侯、华阳君,昭王母宣太后之弟也;而泾阳君、高陵君皆昭王同母弟也。穰侯相，三人者更将,有封邑，以太后故，私家富重于王室。及穰侯为秦将，且欲越韩、魏而伐齐纲、寿,欲以广其陶封。范雎乃上书曰：

臣闻明主立政,有功者不得不赏，有能者不得不官，劳大者其禄厚，功多者其爵尊，能治众者其官大。故无能者不敢当职焉，有能者亦不得蔽隐。使以臣之言为可，愿行而益利其道；以臣之言为不可，久留臣无为也。语曰：“庸主赏所爱而罚所恶；明主则不然，赏必加于有功，而刑必断于有罪。”今臣之胸不足以当椹质，而要不足以待斧钺,岂敢以疑事尝试于王哉!虽以臣为贱人而轻辱,独不重任臣者之无反复于王邪?

且臣闻周有砥碗，宋有结绿，梁有县藜，楚有和朴,此四宝者，土之所生，良工之所失也,而为天下名器。然则圣王之所弃者,独不足以厚国家乎?

臣闻善厚家者取之于国，善厚国者取之于诸侯。天下有明主则诸侯不得擅厚者,何也?为其割荣也。良医知病人之死生，而圣主明于成败之事，利则行之，害则舍之，疑则少尝之,虽舜禹复生,弗能改已。语之至者,臣不敢载之于书,其浅者又不足听也。意者臣愚而不概于王心邪?亡其言臣者贱而不可用乎?自非然者，臣愿得少赐游观之间,望见颜色。一语无效，请伏斧质。

于是秦昭王大说，乃谢王稽，使以传车召范雎。

于是范雎乃得见于离宫,详为不知永巷而入其中。王来，而宦者怒逐之，曰：“王至!”范雎缪为曰:“秦安得王?秦独有太后、穰侯耳。”欲以感怒昭王。昭王至，闻其与宦者争言，遂延迎,谢曰：“寡人宜以身受命久矣,会义渠之事急,寡人旦暮自请太后;今义渠之事已，寡人乃得受命。窃闵然不敏,敬执宾主之礼。”范雎辞让。是日观范雎之见者，群臣莫不洒然变色易容者。

秦王屏左右,宫中虚无人。秦王跽而请曰:“先生何以幸教寡人?”范雎曰：“唯唯。”有间，秦王复跽而请曰：“先生何以幸教寡人?”范雎曰：“唯唯。”若是者三。秦王跽曰：“先生卒不幸教寡人邪?”范雎曰：“非敢然也。臣闻昔者吕尚之遇文王也，身为渔父而钓于渭滨耳。若是者，交疏也。已说而立为太师,载与俱归者，其言深也。故文王遂收功于吕尚而卒王天下。乡使文王疏吕尚而不与深言四，是周无天子之德,而文武无与成其王业也。今臣羁旅之臣也,交疏于王，而所愿陈者皆匡君之事,处人骨肉之间,愿效愚忠而未知王之心也。此所以王三问而不敢对者也。

“臣非有畏而不敢言也。臣知今日言之于前而明日伏诛于后，然臣不敢避也。大王信行臣之言,死不足以为臣患，亡不足以为臣忧,漆身为厉、被发为狂不足以为臣耻。且以五帝之圣焉而死，三王之仁焉而死，五伯之贤焉而死，乌获、任鄙之力焉而死,成荆、孟贲、王庆忌、夏育之勇焉而死。死者，人之所必不免也。处必然之势,可以少有补于秦，此臣之所大愿也，臣又何患哉!伍子胥橐载而出昭关,夜行昼伏，至于陵水,无以糊其口,膝行蒲伏,稽首肉袒,鼓腹吹篪,乞食于吴市,卒兴吴国，阖闾为伯。使臣得尽谋如伍子胥，加之以幽囚,终身不复见,是臣之说行也，臣又何忧?箕子、接舆漆身为厉，被发为狂,无益于主。假使臣得同行于箕子，可以有补于所贤之主，是臣之大荣也，臣有何耻?臣之所恐者，独恐臣死之后，天下见臣之尽忠而身死，因以是杜口裹足，莫肯乡秦耳。足下上畏太后之严@,下惑于奸臣之态,居深宫之中，不离阿保之手,终身迷惑，无与昭奸。大者宗庙灭覆，小者身以孤危，此臣之所恐耳。若夫穷辱之事，死亡之患，臣不敢畏也。臣死而秦治，是臣死贤于生。”

秦王跽曰：“先生是何言也!夫秦国辟远,寡人愚不肖，先生乃幸辱至于此,是天以寡人恩先生而存先王之宗庙也。寡人得受命于先生，是天所以幸先王，而不弃其孤也。先生奈何而言若是!事无小大，上及太后,下至大臣，愿先生悉以教寡人，无疑寡人也。”范雎拜，秦王亦拜。

范雎曰：“大王之国，四塞以为固,北有甘泉、谷口,南带泾、渭,右陇、蜀,左关、阪,奋击百万,战车千乘，利则出攻，不利则入守，此王者之地也。民怯于私斗而勇于公战,此王者之民也。王并此二者而有之。夫以秦卒之勇，车骑之众，以治诸侯,譬若施韩卢而搏蹇兔也”,霸王之业可致也，而群臣莫当其位。至今闭关十五年，不敢窥兵于山东者,是穰侯为秦谋不忠，而大王之计有所失也。”秦王跽曰：“寡人愿闻失计。”

然左右多窃听者，范雎恐，未敢言内，先言外事，以观秦王之俯仰。因进曰：“夫穰侯越韩、魏而攻齐纲、寿，非计也。少出师则不足以伤齐，多出师则害于秦。臣意王之计,欲少出师而悉韩、魏之兵也，则不义矣。今见与国之不亲也,越人之国而攻，可乎?其于计疏矣。且昔齐滑王南攻楚,破军杀将，再辟地千里,而齐尺寸之地无得焉者，岂不欲得地哉，形势不能有也。诸侯见齐之罢弊,君臣之不和也,兴兵而伐齐，大破之"。士辱兵顿,皆咎其王，曰：‘谁为此计者乎?'王曰：‘文子为之。’大臣作乱，文子出走。故齐所以大破者，以其伐楚而肥韩、魏也。此所谓借贼兵而赍盗粮者也。王不如远交而近攻,得寸则王之寸也，得尺亦王之尺也。今释此而远攻，不亦缪乎!且昔者中山之国地方五百里，赵独吞之，功成名立而利附焉，天下莫之能害也。今夫韩、魏，中国之处而天下之枢也,王其欲霸，必亲中国以为天下枢,以威楚、赵。楚强则附赵，赵强则附楚,楚、赵皆附，齐必惧矣。齐惧，必卑辞重币以事秦四。齐附而韩、魏因可虏也。”昭王曰：“吾欲亲魏久矣，而魏多变之国也，寡人不能亲。请问亲魏奈何@?”对曰：“王卑词重币以事之；不可，则割地而赂之；不可，因举兵而伐之。”王曰：“寡人敬闻命矣。”乃拜范雎为客卿，谋兵事。卒听范雎谋，使五大夫绾伐魏，拔怀。后二岁，拔邢丘。

客卿范雎复说昭王曰：“秦韩之地形，相错如绣。秦之有韩也，譬如木之有蠹也,人之有心腹之病也。天下无变则已，天下有变，其为秦患者孰大于韩乎?王不如收韩。”昭王曰：“吾固欲收韩，韩不听，为之奈何?”对曰：“韩安得无听乎?王下兵而攻荥阳,则巩、成皋之道不通;北断太行之道,则上党之师不下。王一兴兵而攻荥阳，则其国断而为三。夫韩见必亡，安得不听乎?若韩听，而霸事因可虑矣。”王曰：“善。”且欲发使于韩。

范雎日益亲，复说用数年矣,因请间说曰:“臣居山东时,闻齐之有田文,不闻其有王也；闻秦之有太后、穰侯、华阳、高陵、泾阳，不闻其有王也。夫擅国之谓王，能利害之谓王,制杀生之威之谓王。今太后擅行不顾，穰侯出使不报，华阳、泾阳等击断无讳,高陵进退不请。四贵备而国不危者，未之有也。为此四贵者下，乃所谓无王也。然则权安得不倾,令安得从王出乎?臣闻善治国者，乃内固其威而外重其权。穰侯使者操王之重,决制于诸侯,剖符于天下,政適伐国,莫敢不听。战胜攻取则利归于陶，国弊御于诸侯；战败则结怨于百姓，而祸归于社稷。诗曰:‘木实繁者披其枝,披其枝者伤其心；大其都者危其国,尊其臣者卑其主’。崔杼、淖齿管齐,射王股，擢王筋，县之于庙梁，宿昔而死。李兑管赵，囚主父于沙丘，百日而饿死。今秦太后、穰侯用事,高陵、华阳、泾阳佐之，卒无秦王,此亦淖齿、李兑之类也。且夫三代所以亡国者，君专授政,纵酒驰骋弋猎，不听政事。其所授者，妒贤嫉能，御下蔽上，以成其私，不为主计，而主不觉悟，故失其国。今自有秩以上至诸大吏，及王左右,无非相国之人者。见王独立于朝，臣窃为王恐，万世之后“,有秦国者非王子孙也。”昭王闻之大惧，曰：“善。”于是废太后,逐穰侯、高陵、华阳、泾阳君于关外四。秦王乃拜范雎为相，收穰侯之印,使归陶，因使县官给车牛以徙，千乘有余。到关，关阅其宝器,宝器珍怪多于王室。

秦封范雎以应,号为应侯。当是时，秦昭王四十一年也。

范雎既相秦，秦号曰张禄,而魏不知，以为范雎已死久矣。魏闻秦且东伐韩、魏，魏使须贾于秦。范雎闻之，为微行，敝衣间步之邸,见须贾。须贾见之而惊曰：“范叔固无恙乎!”范雎曰：“然。”须贾笑曰：“范叔有说于秦邪?”曰：“不也。雎前日得过于魏相，故亡逃至此，安敢说乎!”须贾曰：“今叔何事?”范雎曰：“臣为人庸赁。”须贾意哀之，留与坐饮食，曰：“范叔一寒如此哉!”乃取其一绨袍以赐之。须贾因问曰：“秦相张君，公知之乎?吾闻幸于王，天下之事皆决于相君。今吾事之去留在张君。孺子岂有客习于相君者哉?”范雎曰：“主人翁习知之。唯雎亦得谒,雎请为见君于张君。”须贾曰：“吾马病，车轴折，非大车驷马,吾固不出。”范雎曰：“愿为君借大车驷马于主人翁。”

范雎归取大车驷马，为须贾御之，入秦相府。府中望见,有识者皆避匿,须贾怪之。至相舍门,谓须贾曰：“待我，我为君先入通于相君。”须贾待门下，持车良久,问门下曰：“范叔不出，何也?”门下曰：“无范叔。”须贾曰：“乡者与我载而入者。”门下曰：“乃吾相张君也。”须贾大惊，自知见卖,乃肉袒膝行，因门下人谢罪。于是范雎盛帷帐，侍者甚众，见之。须贾顿首言死罪，曰：“贾不意君能自致于青云之上,贾不敢复读天下之书，不敢复与天下之事。贾有汤镬之罪,请自屏于胡貉之地,唯君死生之!”范雎曰：“汝罪有几?”曰：“擢贾之发以续贾之罪，尚未足。”范雎曰：“汝罪有三耳。昔者楚昭王时而申包胥为楚却吴军,楚王封之以荆五千户,包胥辞不受，为丘墓之寄于荆也。今雎之先人丘墓亦在魏，公前以雎为有外心于齐而恶雎于魏齐，公之罪一也。当魏齐辱我于厕中，公不止，罪二也。更醉而溺我，公其何忍乎?罪三矣。然公之所以得无死者，以绨袍恋恋,有故人之意，故释公。”乃谢罢。入言之昭王，罢归须贾。

须贾辞于范雎，范雎大供具,尽请诸侯使与坐堂上，食饮甚设;而坐须贾于堂下，置垄豆其前,令两黥徒夹而马食之。数曰:“为我告魏王，急持魏齐头来，不然者，我且屠大梁!”须贾归，以告魏齐。魏齐恐，亡走赵，匿平原君所。

范雎既相，王稽谓范雎曰：“事有不可知者三，有不可奈何者亦三。宫车一日晏驾,是事之不可知者一也。君卒然捐馆舍,是事之不可知者二也。使臣卒然填沟壑,是事之不可知者三也。宫车一日晏驾，君虽恨于臣,无可奈何。君卒然捐馆舍，君虽恨于臣，亦无可奈何。使臣卒然填沟壑，君虽恨于臣，亦无可奈何。”范雎不怿,乃入言于王曰：“非王稽之忠，莫能内臣于函谷关；非大王之贤圣，莫能贵臣。今臣官至于相，爵在列侯，王稽之官尚止于谒者，非其内臣之意也。”昭王召王稽，拜为河东守,三岁不上计。又任郑安平,昭王以为将军。范雎于是散家财物，尽以报所尝困厄者。一饭之德必偿，睚眦之怨必报。

范雎相秦二年，秦昭王之四十二年,东伐韩少曲、高平，拔之。

秦昭王闻魏齐在平原君所，欲为范雎必报其仇，乃详为好书遗平原君曰:“寡人闻君之高义，愿与君为布衣之友,君幸过寡人，寡人愿与君为十日之饮。”平原君畏秦，且以为然，而入秦见昭王。昭王与平原君饮数日，昭王谓平原君曰：“昔周文王得吕尚以为太公,齐桓公得管夷吾以为仲父,今范君亦寡人之叔父也。范君之仇在君之家，愿使人归取其头来；不然，吾不出君于关。”平原君曰：“贵而为交者，为贱也；富而为交者，为贫也。夫魏齐者，胜之友也，在，固不出也，今又不在臣所。”昭王乃遗赵王书曰:“王之弟在秦,范君之仇魏齐在平原君之家。王使人疾持其头来；不然，吾举兵而伐赵，又不出王之弟于关。”赵孝成王乃发卒围平原君家，急，魏齐夜亡出，见赵相虞卿。虞卿度赵王终不可说，乃解其相印，与魏齐亡，间行，念诸侯莫可以急抵者,乃复走大梁，欲因信陵君以走楚。信陵君闻之，畏秦，犹豫未肯见,曰：“虞卿何如人也?”时侯嬴在旁，曰：“人固未易知，知人亦未易也资。夫虞卿蹑屏檐签,一见赵王，赐白璧一双，黄金百镒;再见，拜为上卿;三见，卒受相印，封万户侯。当此之时，天下争知之。夫魏齐穷困过虞卿，虞卿不敢重爵禄之尊，解相印，捐万户侯而间行。急士之穷而归公子，公子曰‘何如人’。人固不易知，知人亦未易也!”信陵君大惭，驾如野迎之。魏齐闻信陵君之初难见之，怒而自刭。赵王闻之，卒取其头予秦。秦昭王乃出平原君归赵。

昭王四十三年,秦攻韩汾陉,拔之，因城河上广武。

后五年,昭王用应侯谋，纵反间卖赵,赵以其故，令马服子代廉颇将。秦大破赵于长平,遂围邯郸。已而与武安君白起有隙，言而杀之。任郑安平，使击赵。郑安平为赵所围，急，以兵二万人降赵。应侯席稿请罪。秦之法，任人而所任不善者，各以其罪罪之。于是应侯罪当收三族。秦昭王恐伤应侯之意，乃下令国中：“有敢言郑安平事者，以其罪罪之。”而加赐相国应侯食物日益厚，以顺适其意。后二岁,王稽为河东守，与诸侯通，坐法诛。而应侯日益以不怿。

昭王临朝叹息，应侯进曰：“臣闻‘主忧臣辱，主辱臣死’。今大王中朝而忧，臣敢请其罪。”昭王曰：“吾闻楚之铁剑利而倡优拙。夫铁剑利则士勇，倡优拙则思虑远。夫以远思虑而御勇士，吾恐楚之图秦也。夫物不素具，不可以应卒,今武安君既死，而郑安平等畔,内无良将而外多敌国，吾是以忧。”欲以激励应侯,应侯惧，不知所出。蔡泽闻之，往入秦也。

蔡泽者，燕人也。游学干诸侯小大甚众,不遇。而从唐举相,曰：“吾闻先生相李兑，曰‘百日之内持国秉’,有之乎?”曰：“有之。”曰：“若臣者何如?”唐举孰视而笑曰:“先生曷鼻，巨肩，魅颜，蹙蝎，膝挛。吾闻圣人不相，殆先生乎?”蔡泽知唐举戏之，乃曰：“富贵吾所自有，吾所不知者寿也，愿闻之。”唐举曰：“先生之寿，从今以往者四十三岁。”蔡泽笑谢而去，谓其御者曰：“吾持粱啮肥,跃马疾驱，怀黄金之印，结紫绶于要,揖让人主之前，食肉富贵,四十三年足矣。”去之赵，见逐。之韩、魏，遇夺釜鬲于涂。闻应侯任郑安平、王稽皆负重罪于秦，应侯内惭，蔡泽乃西入秦。

将见昭王，使人宣言以感怒应侯曰:“燕客蔡泽，天下雄俊弘辩智士也。彼一见秦王，秦王必困君而夺君之位。"应侯闻，曰：“五帝三代之事，百家之说，吾既知之，众口之辩,吾皆摧之，是恶能困我而夺我位乎?”使人召蔡泽。蔡泽人，则揖应侯。应侯固不快，及见之，又倨,应侯因让之曰：“子尝宣言欲代我相秦，宁有之乎?”对曰：“然。”应侯曰：“请闻其说。”蔡泽曰：“吁，君何见之晚也!夫四时之序，成功者去。夫人生百体坚强,手足便利，耳目聪明而心圣智，岂非士之愿与?”应侯曰：“然。”蔡泽曰：“质仁秉义,行道施德，得志于天下，天下怀乐敬爱而尊慕之,皆愿以为君王，岂不辩智之期与?”应侯曰：“然。”蔡泽复曰：“富贵显荣，成理万物四，使各得其所；性命寿长，终其天年而不夭伤；天下继其统，守其业，传之无穷；名实纯粹，泽流千里，世世称之而无绝,与天地终始：岂道德之符而圣人所谓吉祥善事者与?”应侯曰：“然。”

蔡泽曰：“若夫秦之商君,楚之吴起,越之大夫种,其卒然亦可愿与?”应侯知蔡泽之欲困己以说,复谬曰:“何为不可?夫公孙鞅之事孝公也,极身无贰虑，尽公而不顾私；设刀锯以禁奸邪，信赏罚以致治;披腹心，示情素,蒙怨咎,欺旧友，夺魏公子卬,安秦社稷，利百姓，卒为秦禽将破敌，攘地千里。吴起之事悼王也,使私不得害公，谗不得蔽忠，言不取苟合,行不取苟容,不为危易行，行义不辟难，然为霸主强国,不辞祸凶。大夫种之事越王也,主虽困辱，悉忠而不解，主虽绝亡四，尽能而弗离，成功而弗矜，贵富而不骄怠。若此三子者，固义之至也，忠之节也。是故君子以义死难，视死如归；生而辱不如死而荣。士固有杀身以成名，唯义之所在，虽死无所恨。何为不可哉?”

蔡泽曰：“主圣臣贤，天下之盛福也；君明臣直，国之福也；父慈子孝，夫信妻贞，家之福也。故比干忠而不能存殷,子胥智而不能完吴,申生孝而晋国乱。是皆有忠臣孝子，而国家灭乱者，何也?无明君贤父以听之，故天下以其君父为缪辱而怜其臣子。今商君、吴起、大夫种之为人臣，是也；其君，非也。故世称三子致功而不见德,岂慕不遇世死乎?夫待死而后可以立忠成名，是微子不足仁,孔子不足圣,管仲不足大也。夫人之立功，岂不期于成全邪?身与名俱全者，上也。名可法而身死者，其次也。名在缪辱而身全者，下也。"于是应侯称善。

蔡泽少得间,因曰：“夫商君、吴起、大夫种，其为人臣尽忠致功则可愿矣，闳夭事文王,周公辅成王也,岂不亦忠圣乎?以君臣论之,商君、吴起、大夫种其可愿孰与闳夭、周公哉?”应侯曰：“商君、吴起、大夫种弗若也。”

蔡泽曰：“然则君之主慈仁任忠,惇厚旧故，其贤智与有道之士为胶漆,义不倍功臣,孰与秦孝公、楚悼王、越王乎?”应侯曰：“未知何如也。”

蔡泽曰：“今主亲忠臣，不过秦孝公、楚悼王、越王，君之设智能,为主安危修政,治乱强兵，批患折难,广地殖谷，富国足家，强主，尊社稷，显宗庙，天下莫敢欺犯其主，主之威盖震海内,功彰万里之外，声名光辉传于千世，君孰与商君、吴起、大夫种?”应侯曰：“不若。”

蔡泽曰：“今主之亲忠臣不忘旧故不若孝公、悼王、句践，而君之功绩爱信亲幸又不若商君、吴起、大夫种，然而君之禄位贵盛，私家之富过于三子，而身不退者，恐患之甚于三子，窃为君危之。

“语曰‘日中则移，月满则亏’。物盛则衰，天地之常数也。进退盈缩，与时变化,圣人之常道也，故‘国有道则仕，国无道则隐’。圣人曰‘飞龙在天，利见大人’,‘不义而富且贵，于我如浮云’。今君之怨已雠而德已报,意欲至矣，而无变计，窃为君不取也。

“且夫翠、鹄、犀、象，其处势非不远死也,而所以死者，惑于饵也。苏秦、智伯之智,非不足以辟辱远死也，而所以死者，惑于贪利不止也。是以圣人制礼节欲，取于民有度，使之以时，用之有止，故志不溢，行不骄，常与道俱而不失,故天下承而不绝。昔者齐桓公九合诸侯,一匡天下,至于葵丘之会,有骄矜之志，畔者九国。吴王夫差兵无敌于天下，勇强以轻诸侯，陵齐、晋,故遂以杀身亡国。夏育、太史噭叱呼骇三军，然而身死于庸夫。此皆乘至盛而不返道理,不居卑退处俭约之患也。

“夫商君为秦孝公明法令，禁奸本,尊爵必赏,有罪必罚，平权衡、正度量、调轻重,决裂阡陌,以静生民之业而一其俗,劝民耕农利土,一室无二事,力田蓄积，习战陈之事,是以兵动而地广，兵休而国富，故秦无敌于天下，立威诸侯，成秦国之业。功已成矣，而遂以车裂。楚地方数千里，持戟百万，白起率数万之师以与楚战，一战举鄢郢以烧夷陵,再战南并蜀汉四。又越韩、魏而攻强赵，北坑马服,诛屠四十余万之众，尽之于长平之下，流血成川，沸声若雷，遂入围邯郸,使秦有帝业。楚、赵天下之强国而秦之仇敌也，自是之后，楚、赵皆慑伏不敢攻秦者，白起之势也。身所服者七十余城，功已成矣，而遂赐剑死于杜邮。吴起为楚悼王立法，卑减大臣之威重，罢无能，废无用，损不急之官，塞私门之请，一楚国之俗，禁游客之民，精耕战之士，南收杨越,北并陈、蔡，破横散从，使驰说之士无所开其口，禁朋党以励百姓，定楚国之政，兵震天下，威服诸侯。功已成矣，而卒枝解。大夫种为越王深谋远计，免会稽之危，以亡为存，因辱为荣，垦草入邑四，辟地殖谷，率四方之士，专上下之力,辅句践之贤，报夫差之仇，卒擒劲吴，令越成霸。功已彰而信矣，句践终负而杀之。此四子者，功成不去，祸至于此。此所谓信而不能诎,往而不能返者也。范蠡知之，超然辟世，长为陶朱公。

“君独不观夫博者乎?或欲大投，或欲分功,此皆君之所明知也。今君相秦，计不下席，谋不出廊庙,坐制诸侯，利施三川，以实宜阳,决羊肠之险，塞太行之道,又斩范、中行之涂,六国不得合从，栈道千里,通于蜀汉,使天下皆畏秦，秦之欲得矣，君之功极矣，此亦秦之分功之时也。如是而不退，则商君、白公、吴起、大夫种是也。吾闻之，‘鉴于水者见面之容，鉴于人者知吉与凶’。《书》曰‘成功之下，不可久处’。四子之祸，君何居焉?君何不以此时归相印，让贤者而授之，退而岩居川观，必有伯夷之廉，长为应侯，世世称孤，而有许由、延陵季子之让,乔、松之寿，孰与以祸终哉?即君忍不能自离,疑不能自决，必有四子之祸矣。《易》曰‘亢龙有悔’,此言上而不能下，信而不能屈，往而不能自返者也。愿君孰计之!”

应侯曰：“善。吾闻‘欲而不知足，失其所以欲；有而不知止，失其所以有’。先生幸教，雎敬受命。”于是乃延入坐，为上客。

后数日，入朝，言于秦昭王曰：“客新有从山东来者曰蔡泽，其人辩士，明于三王之事，五伯之业，世俗之变,足以寄秦国之政。臣之见人甚众，莫及，臣不如也。臣敢以闻。”秦昭王召见，与语，大说之，拜为客卿。应侯因谢病请归相印。昭王强起应侯,应侯遂称病笃。范雎免相,昭王新说蔡泽计画，遂拜为秦相,东收周室。

蔡泽相秦数月，人或恶之,惧诛，乃谢病，归相印,号为纲成君。居秦十余年,事昭王、孝文王、庄襄王。卒事始皇帝,为秦使于燕,三年而燕使太子丹入质于秦。

太史公曰：韩子称“长袖善舞，多钱善贾”,信哉是言也!范雎、蔡泽世所谓一切辩士,然游说诸侯至白首无所遇者，非计策之拙，所为说力少也。及二人羁旅入秦,继踵取卿相，垂功于天下者，固强弱之势异也。然士亦有偶合,贤者多如此二子，不得尽意,岂可胜道哉!然二子不困厄，恶能激乎?</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">范雎是魏国人，字叔。他游说诸侯，想要事奉魏王，但因家中贫困没钱达到自己的目的，就先事奉魏国的中大夫须贾。

须贾替魏昭王出使齐国，范雎随从他一起出使。他们在齐国逗留了几个月，仍没有得到齐国的回音。齐襄王听说范雎能言善辩，就派人赐给他金十斤以及牛和酒，范雎辞谢不敢接受。须贾知道后，大怒，认为范雎把魏国的秘密泄露给了齐国，因此才得到了这些馈赠，令范雎接受齐人的牛和酒，归还赠金。回到魏国后，须贾心中恼恨范雎，就把这件事告诉了魏国的相国。魏国的相国是魏国的宗室公子，名叫魏齐。魏齐大怒，命舍人痛打范雎，打断了他的肋骨，牙齿也掉了。范雎假装已死，他们就用席子把他卷起来，扔在厕所里。宾客喝醉了，轮流往范雎身上撒尿，故意侮辱他以惩戒后人，使人们不敢乱说话。范雎在席子里对看守说：“您如果能把我放出去，我一定会厚谢您。”看守于是就请求扔掉席子中的死人。魏齐喝醉了，就说：“可以。”范雎这才逃了出来。后来魏齐后悔了，又派人去找他。魏国人郑安平听说了，就带着范雎逃跑，把他藏匿起来，改名换姓叫做张禄。

正在这个时候，秦昭王派谒者王稽出使魏国。郑安平假扮为差役服侍王稽。王稽问：“魏国有没有可以和我一起去西方的能人?”郑安平说：“臣乡里有张禄先生，想见您，说说天下的大事。这个人有仇家，不敢白天来见您。”王稽说：“晚上让他和你一起来。”晚上郑安平带着张禄一起去见王稽。话没说多少，王稽就看出范雎确实是个能人，于是对他说：“请先生在三亭南面等我。”他们私下约定之后，范雎就离去了。

王稽辞别魏王离去，经过三亭，就用车载着范雎到了秦国。到了湖县，望见有车马从西方来。范雎说：“那边来的是谁?”王稽说：“是秦的相国穰侯到东边来巡察县邑。”范雎说：“我听说穰侯把持秦国大权，讨厌接纳其他诸侯门客，他恐怕要侮辱我，我宁愿暂时藏在车里。”过了一会儿，穰侯果然来了，慰劳王稽，顺便立住车马说：“关东有什么变化?”王稽说：“没有。”穰侯又对王稽说：“您没有和诸侯门客一起来吧?他们没有用，只能扰乱国家罢了。”王稽说：“不敢。”穰侯随即告别离去。范雎说：“我听说穰侯是聪明人，但他遇事反应较慢，刚才怀疑车中有人，却忘了搜查。”于是范雎下车跑了，说：“他一定会后悔而重来。”走了十几里，穰侯果然派人骑马来搜查车子，见车上无人这才罢休。王稽于是带着范雎进入了咸阳。

王稽向秦王汇报完出使情况，接着说：“魏国有个张禄先生，是天下一流的能言善辩之士。他说：‘秦王的政权非常危险，有了我就会转危为安。但其中缘故不能用书信来表达。'因此我用车把他带来了。”秦王不相信，但还是把他留下来让他住在客舍中吃些粗劣的饭食。范雎就这样等待了一年多。

这时候，秦昭王已经继位三十六年了。秦向南攻下了楚国的鄢和郢，楚怀王被幽禁而死。秦向东打败了齐国。齐滑王曾经称帝，后来放弃了帝号。秦还数次围困三晋。秦厌烦了天下言辩之士，谁也不相信。

穰侯、华阳君，是秦昭王的母亲宣太后的弟弟；而泾阳君、高陵君都是昭王同母弟弟。穰侯做秦国的丞相，其他三人交替为将，有自己的封邑，凭着太后的关系，他们的私人财富比王室还多。等到穰侯为秦将时，更想越过韩、魏去攻伐齐国的纲邑、寿邑，以此扩大他的封地陶邑。范雎于是上书说：

我听说圣明的君主掌握政权，有功劳的不能不赏赐，有能力的不能不让他做官，功劳大的俸禄就优厚，功劳多的爵位就尊宠，能治理民众的官就大。所以没有能力的人就不能做官，有能力的人也不会被埋没。假如认为我的话是对的，希望能采纳实行以期有利于治国；如果认为我说的不对，则让我久留于此也没有意义。俗话说：“昏庸的君主奖赏他宠爱的人而惩罚他讨厌的人，圣明的君主就不这样，奖赏必定要给那些有功的人，而刑罚也必定针对那些有罪的人。”如今我的身体也不是不怕刀砍斧剁，怎么敢把没有把握的事在大王面前随便摆弄呢?您即使认为我是低贱的人而轻视我羞辱我，难道还不相信保荐我的人对您不会做没有把握的事情吗?

而且我听说周有宝玉砥碗，宋有宝玉结绿，梁有宝玉县藜，楚有宝玉和朴，这四块宝玉，是土中所生，都被好工匠判断错了，然而却是天下最有名的宝贝。那么现在您所遗弃的，难道就不能对国家有些用处么?

我听说善于使家族富足的人取自国家，善于使国家富足的人取自诸侯。天下如果有明主，诸侯就不能独自富足，这是为什么呢?是因为他能分割诸侯的权力。良医知道病人的死生，圣明的君主明察事情的成败，有利的就做，不利的就放弃，把握不大的就先试做一点，即使是舜禹复生，也只能这样。最中肯的话，我不敢写在纸上，太肤浅的，又不足以说给您听。莫不是我愚笨到不能使您满意?或者是推荐我的人地位低下不可信用?如果不是这样，我希望得到您的一点游玩之余的时间，请让我见您一面。如果我说的全是废话，情愿伏罪领死。

于是秦昭王非常高兴，就向王稽道歉，派人用传车去召见范雎。

于是范雎才得以在离宫进见秦王，他假装不认得内宫而闯了进去。秦王来了，宦官发怒了，驱逐着他说：“大王来了!”范雎故意乱说道：“秦哪有王?秦只有太后、穰侯罢了。”想以此触动激怒昭王。昭王到了，听到他和宦官在争吵，就迎接他，道歉说：“寡人早就应该亲自来接受您的教诲了，正好赶上义渠的事很紧急，寡人早晚亲自向太后请命；现在义渠的事已经结束了，寡人才得以接受您的教诲。寡人愚昧迟钝，请允许寡人行宾主之礼，把你当作贵客接待。”范雎推辞。这天观看范雎晋见秦王的大臣们，没有不肃然变色的。

秦王让左右的人都回避出去，宫中再没有别人。秦王长跪请求说：“先生有什么要指教寡人的?”范雎只是应声而没有说话。过了一会，秦王又跪起来说：“先生还是不肯指教寡人么?”范雎也只是“哦哦”的应着，并没有说话。如此反复多次。奏王跪着说：“您终归是不肯指教我了么?”范雎说：“我哪敢这样呢。我听说从前吕尚遇见周文王的时候，只是个在渭水边钓鱼的渔翁，与文王的交情并不深。但一番谈话之后就被立为太师，与文王同车而归，是因为他谈得深入，说很投机啊。所以文王就最终能够因为任用吕尚成就大功，成为天下共主。假如文王疏远吕尚而不与他深入交谈，那就说明周没有天子的德行，周文王、武王也就无法成就王业了。现在我是寄居在这里的外国人，与大王没什么交情，但我想说的却是匡正君王的、议论人家骨肉至亲的事情，想效愚忠却不知道大王的真正心思。这就是为什么大王三问而我不敢对答的原因。

我不是有所怕而不敢讲。我知道今天在您面前一说，明天就要被杀掉，但是我不敢逃避。大王如果听信我的话并付诸实行，死不是我担心的，流亡也不足以让我感到忧虑，身上涂漆长满癞疮，披散头发变成疯子也不足以让我感到羞耻。况且五帝那样的圣人也得死，三王那样的仁人也得死，五霸那样的贤能也得死，乌获、任鄙那样力大无穷也得死，成荆、孟贲、王庆忌、夏育那样勇敢也得死。死是人无论如何也免不了的。既然死是必然的，如果对秦国能有一点补救，这就是我最大的愿望了，我又怕什么呢!伍子胥被装在袋子里才出了昭关，晚上赶路，白天躲起来，到了陵水时，没有吃的，在地上爬行，光着身子行礼，鼓起肚子吹乐，在吴国的集市上讨饭，最终却能够振兴吴国，让阖闾做了霸主。假如能让我像伍子胥一样用尽我的谋略，即使把我关起来，终身不再见我，我的言论能够实行，我又忧虑什么呢?箕子、接舆身上涂漆，满身癞疮，披散头发做疯子，对于君主没有用。假如让我能与箕子一样，却可以对我认为贤能的君主有所补救，这是我的最大的光荣，我又有什么可羞耻的?我唯独害怕的是在我死之后，天下人见我尽忠而身死，因而都闭紧嘴，缩住脚，不肯到秦国来了。您上畏太后的威严，下惑于奸臣的巧言令色，住在深宫里，不离左右近侍，终身被迷惑，没办法看清奸佞。严重的会亡国，轻微的也会威胁到自己的生命，这是我害怕的事。至于困窘受辱，遭遇死亡的灾难，我并不畏惧。我死而秦国得到治理，我死了也贤于活着。”

秦王长跪说：“先生说的是什么话!秦国地处偏僻，离中原遥远，寡人愚昧不肖，幸好先生屈尊到了这里，这是上天把寡人托付给先生来保存秦国。寡人我能接受先生的指教，是上天恩宠先王，不遗弃他的孤儿。先生怎么能这样说呢?事不分大小，上及太后，下至重要的大臣，希望先生全都能指点寡人，不要怀疑寡人。”范雎拜谢秦王，秦王也回拜范雎。

范雎说：“大王的国家，四方边塞坚固，北面有甘泉山、谷口，南面有泾水、渭水，西面有陇山、蜀地，东面有函谷关、商坂，有数百万勇猛的士兵，数千乘战车，对我方有利时可以出击，不利时可以退守，这是帝王的土地。人民害怕私人争斗但对于为公家出战很勇敢，这是帝王的百姓。大王二者兼有。凭秦国士兵的勇猛，战车与骑兵的众多，用来控制诸侯，就像放出最迅猛的猎狗去追瘸腿的兔子一样，霸王的功业一定可以确立，只是群臣不称职。至今闭关十五年，不敢窥视出兵山东诸国，是因为穰侯不忠心为秦国出谋划策，大王的计策有所失误的缘故。”秦王长跪说：“寡人希望听听失误之处。”

但是左右有很多窃听的人，范雎害怕，不敢说内事，先说外事，以此来观察秦王的态度。于是进言道：“穰侯越过韩、魏而攻齐国的纲、寿二城，不是好计策。出兵少不足以伤害齐国，出兵多就会伤害到秦国。我猜测大王的计划，是想少出兵而让韩、魏出全部兵力，这是不义之举。现在即将看到同盟国与我们不亲善了，怎么能越过人家的国家去进攻?从计谋来说太粗疏了。况且过去齐滑王向南攻击楚国，打败楚军杀了楚将，两次开辟了千里土地，而齐国一尺一寸的地盘也没得到，是它不想得到这些地盘吗?形势不允许啊!诸侯见到齐国已经疲惫，加之君臣不和，于是举兵伐齐，大破齐国。齐国士人感到耻辱，军备受到毁废，都归咎于齐王，说：‘谁出的这个主意?'齐王说：‘是文子。'大臣们作乱，文子逃亡国外。齐国大败的原因是伐楚而使韩、魏得了便宜。这就是所谓把兵借给贼而把粮食送给强盗。大王不如结交远方国家攻打邻近国家，得到一寸土地也是大王的土地，得到一尺土地就是大王的土地。现在不这样却去攻击远方诸侯，不是太离谱了吗?况且过去中山国方圆五百里，赵国将其独吞，成就了功业，树立了威名也得到了实际利益，诸侯对它也无可奈何。现在韩、魏地处中原，是中原的门户，大王想要称霸，一定要亲近中原作为天下的枢纽，来威胁楚、赵。楚国强大，就亲附赵国，赵国强大，就亲附楚国，楚、赵都亲附秦国，齐国一定会害怕，齐国一害怕，一定会言辞低下带着丰厚的礼品来事奉秦国。齐国一旦归附，韩、魏也就唾手可得了。”昭王说：“我想亲近魏国已经很久了，但魏是多变的国家，我亲近不了。请问怎样才能亲近它呢?”范雎回答说：“大王用谦逊的言辞与丰厚的礼物去事奉它；它不答应，就割裂土地去贿赂它；它不答应，就趁势出兵攻伐它。”秦王说：“寡人恭敬地听从您的命令。”于是就拜范雎为客卿，谋划军事。秦最终听取了范雎的计策，派五大夫绾讨伐魏国，攻下怀邑。又过了两年，攻下了邢丘。

客卿范雎又游说秦昭王说：“秦、韩两国的地形，像刺绣一样互相交	错。秦有韩作邻国，就如树里长了蠹虫，人的心腹生了病。天下没有变动还则罢了，天下一旦有变动，还有谁比韩国对秦国的危害更大?大王不如收服韩国。”昭王说：“我早就想收服韩国，韩国不听话，怎么办呢?”范雎回答说：“韩国怎么能不听话?大王南下攻荥阳，那么巩县、成皋的	道路就不通；向北切断太行山的道路，上党的军队就过不来。大王一旦举兵攻打荥阳，韩国就被切成三段。韩看到这种一定会灭亡的形势，怎能不听话呢?若韩听话，就可以顺势考虑称霸的事了。”昭王说：“很好。”便要派人前往韩国。

范雎越来越得到信任，被宠爱信用了好几年，于是找了个机会说：“我住在山东时，只听说齐国有田文，没听说还有齐王；只听说秦国有太后、穰侯、华阳君、高陵君、泾阳君，没听说过有大王。能够独掌国家大权才叫王，能独掌利害大权才叫王，能独掌生杀大权才叫王。现在太后独断专行不顾一切，穰侯出使不汇报，华阳君、泾阳君断罪判罚毫不忌讳，高陵君提拔人、贬退人也不向大王请示。这四种尊贵的人存在而国家不危亡的，还没有过。在这四位尊贵的人物之下，就称不上王了。这样权力怎么可能不倾覆，大王又怎么能发布命令呢?我听说善于治理国家的人，对内要巩固他的威信，对外要确立他的权威。穰侯的使者拿着大王的符印，决定诸侯间的事情，与天下各国结盟，征伐敌人侵伐他国，没有人敢不听。打了胜仗，占了地盘，好处就都给了陶邑，有了弊病则推卸给其他国家；打败了，老百姓就怨声载道，灾祸就要国家来承担。古诗说：‘树上果实多了就会压断树枝，压断了树枝就会伤到树心；都邑大了就会危害到国家，臣子太尊贵了就会瞧不起君主。'齐国的崔杼射伤齐庄公的大腿、淖齿抽了齐滑王的筋，把他吊在祖庙的房梁上，过了一宿才死。赵国的李兑掌了权，把主父围困在沙丘宫，把他饿了一百多天，活活饿死。现在秦国太后、穰侯掌权，高陵君、华阳君、泾阳君辅助他们，不把秦王您放在眼里，这也是淖齿、李兑一类人物啊。况且传三代就要亡国的原因，是君主把权力交给臣下，自己放纵喝酒打猎，不听国政。掌权的大臣，妒贤嫉能，收服下属，蒙蔽君主，培植私人力量，不为君主考虑，而君主还不觉悟，所以就失掉了国家。现在从只要是个官的到重要大臣，以至大王左右近侍，都是相国的人。看到大王在朝廷上孤立无援，我私下里为大王担心，怕万世之后，享有秦国的就不是大王的子孙了。”昭王听后非常害怕，说：“你说得很对。”于是就废了太后，把穰侯、高陵君、华阳君、泾阳君驱逐到关外。秦王拜范雎为相，收回穰侯的相印，让他回陶邑去，由公家供给他车和牛用来迁居，用了一千多辆车。到了函谷关，守关的检察他的宝器，宝器比王室的还珍贵稀奇。

秦杷应地封给范雎，号应侯，这时是秦昭王四十一年。

范雎做了秦国相国，秦人叫他张禄，而魏国不知道，以为范雎已经死了很久了。魏国听说秦国要东伐韩、魏，就派须贾出使秦国。范雎听说后，就私行出府，穿着破衣服从小路走到馆舍，拜见须贾。须贾见到他吃惊道：“范叔原来安然无恙吗?”范雎说：“是啊。”须贾笑着说：“范叔没有游说过秦国吗?”范雎说：“没有。范雎过去得罪了魏相，所以逃亡到这里，哪还敢游说呢?”须贾说：“现在你做什么事?”范雎说：“我给人做长工。”须贾心里可怜他，留他坐下来一起吃饭，说：“范叔竟然这么贫寒啊!”于是取了一件绨袍送给他。须贾顺便问道：“秦相国张君，你认识么?我听说他特别受秦王宠爱，天下的事都听他决定。现在我的事情成败都决定于他，你有没有与相国相熟的人呢?”范雎说：“我的主人熟悉他。我也能见到他，就让我将您引见给张君吧。”须贾说：“我的马病了，车轴也断了，不是大车驷马，我一定不出门。”范雎说：“我愿意为您向主人借大车驷马。”

范雎回去取来大车驷马，为须贾赶着车，进入秦国相府。相府中的人老远看见，凡是认识的都赶紧让路，须贾感到奇怪。到相府内宅门口，范雎对须贾说：“等我一下，我先进去为您通报一声。”须贾在门口守着车子等着，等了很长时间，就问门房说：“范叔还不出来，是怎么回事?”门房说：“这里没有范叔。”须贾说：“就是刚才和我一起乘车来的。”门房说：“那是我们的相国张君。”须贾大吃一惊，知道自己被耍了，于是就脱了上衣光着背，用膝盖跪行，请门房代他通报去谢罪。于是范雎摆出豪华的仪仗，众多侍者，接见须贾。须贾磕头连称死罪，说：“我没想到您能凭自己的力量使自己达到这样高的地位，我不敢再读天下书，不敢再参与天下的政务。我的罪过足以让您把我扔进汤锅煮了，我请求您把我放逐到荒郊野外，狐狸出没的地方，我是生是死全凭您发落!”范雎说：“你有几条罪状?”须贾说：“就是把我的头发全拔下来，一根头发算一项罪状也还不够。”范雎说：“你只有三条罪状。过去楚昭王的时候，申包胥为楚国退吴兵，楚王把荆地五千户封给他，他推辞不肯接受，为的是怕死后不得埋在荆地。现在我的祖坟也在魏国，你过去以为我有外心于齐而向魏齐诬陷我，这是你的第一大罪状；当魏齐把我丢到厕所里侮辱我，你不制止，这是第二大罪状；让喝醉了的人轮番地往我身上小便，你怎么就那么忍心呢?这是你的第三大罪状。但是你能够免除死罪，是因为你还能可怜我，赠给我绨袍，有老相识的情义，所以我放了你。”于是散会。范雎进宫告诉秦王，办完事情放须贾回去。

须贾向范雎辞行，范雎摆上丰盛的酒筵，把各诸侯国的使者都请了来，和他们一起坐在正堂上，食物非常丰美。却让须贾坐于堂下，在他面前摆上马料，让两个奴隶一边一个地押着他像马吃草那样吃那些垄豆，并训斥他道：“你替我告诉魏王，赶快把魏齐的头送来，要不然，我就屠灭大梁城!”须贾回到魏国，把一切都告诉魏齐。魏齐非常害怕，逃到赵国，藏在平原君那里。

范雎已经做了相国，王稽对范雎说：“事情有三种不可知的情况，有三种无可奈何的情况。大王说不准哪天去世了，这是第一种不可知的情况；您说不准哪天去世了，这是第二种不可知的情况；我说不准哪天死了，这是第三种不可知的情况。大王一旦死了，您觉得有对不住我的地方，也就无可奈何了；您一旦死了，您觉得有对不住我的地方，也就无可奈何了；我一旦死了，您觉得有对不住我的地方，也就无可奈何了。”范雎心中不快，于是进宫见昭王说：“如果不是王稽忠心，就不能让我进函谷关；如果不是大王贤明，就不能使臣尊贵。现在我的官做到了相国，爵位到了列侯，王稽官位还只是个谒者，这不是他把我带来的原意啊。”昭王召见王稽，拜他为河东守，三年不用交赋税。范雎又保荐郑安平，昭王让他做了将军。范雎于是散出了家里的财物，全用来回报过去一同受过磨难的人，做到一顿饭的恩情也一定报答，一点点的仇怨也要报复。

范雎做秦相的第二年，即秦昭王四十二年，秦国向东攻打韩国的少曲、高平，都攻了下来。

秦昭王听说魏齐在平原君那里，就想为范雎报仇，于是给平原君写了一封假装友好的书信说：“我听说您很重义气，希望能与您结为布衣之友。您能不能屈尊到我这里来，我希望能和您一起痛饮十天。”平原君出于害怕秦国，且又信以为真，遂入秦晋见昭王。昭王与平原君喝了几天酒，对平原君说：“过去周文王得到了吕尚把他当作太公，齐桓公得到了管夷吾把他当作仲父，现在范叔也是寡人的叔父。范君的仇人在您家，希望您能派人回去取他的头来，不然，我也不让您出关。”平原君说：“一个富贵人之所以与人交朋友，是防备自己日后有贫贱的时候。魏齐是我的朋友，他在我家，我一定不会交出他，何况现在他并不在我家。”昭王便又写了一封信给赵王：“您的兄弟在秦国，范雎的仇人魏齐在平原君家。大王派人赶紧把他的头送来；不然，我就出兵攻打赵国，并且不放您的兄弟出关。”赵孝成王于是发兵包围了平原君家，事态紧急，魏齐连夜逃出，去见赵相虞卿。虞卿估计这时候已经无法说服赵王，就解下相印，与魏齐一起逃亡，从小路逃跑，考虑没有可以在困穷无路的情况下去投奔的，于是就逃回大梁，想借信陵君的关系逃到楚国去。信陵君听说了，出于害怕秦国，犹犹豫豫地不肯见他们，说：“虞卿是怎样一个人?”当时侯赢在他身边，说：“人确实不容易了解，了解人也真不容易。虞卿穿着草鞋，扛着雨伞，第一次见赵王，赵王就赐他白璧一双，黄金百镒；第二次见赵王，就拜为上卿；第三次见赵王，就交给他相印，封他为万户侯。这时候，全天下的人都争着结识他。魏齐因为困窘去见他，他不看重尊贵的爵禄，解下相印，放弃了万户侯而从小路逃走。陷于困境的士人来归附公子，公子却说‘是怎样的人’。人确实不容易了解，了解人也真不容易!”信陵君非常惭愧，驾上车到郊外去迎接他们。魏齐听说信陵君当初不愿见他，发怒自刎而死。赵王听说了，最终还是取来他的头给了秦王，秦昭王才放平原君出关回赵国。

秦昭王四十三年，秦攻下了韩国的汾陉，顺势在黄河边的广武筑了城。

五年后，昭王又用应侯的计谋，行反间计欺骗赵国，赵国中计，派马服君赵奢之子赵括代替廉颇为将。秦在长平大败赵军，于是围困了邯郸。不久范雎与武安君白起发生了矛盾，于是他就对秦王说白起的坏话，最终迫使白起自杀。范雎任用郑安平，派他攻击赵国。郑安平被赵军围困，情况紧急，就带着两万士兵投降了赵国。应侯跪在草垫子上请罪。秦国的法律，任人不当，被任者表现不好，举任者应予同罪。照这样，应侯的罪应当被诛杀三族。秦昭王怕伤了应侯的心，就下令全国：“有敢提郑安平的事，就按郑安平的罪判他。”同时赏赐相国应侯的饮食物品日益丰富，以此来安慰他。两年后，王稽做河东守与诸侯私下互相勾结，犯法被杀。因此应侯越来越闷闷不乐。

昭王在朝堂上叹息，应侯上前说：“我听说‘君主忧虑，臣子就将感到耻辱；君主受辱，臣子就得死’。现在大王上朝时感到忧虑，臣应当请罪。”昭王说：“我听说楚国的铁剑很锋利而歌舞艺人却很差。铁剑锋利将士就勇猛，歌舞艺人差国君思虑就长远。用深谋远虑来驾驭勇猛的将士，我担心楚国会打秦国的主意。事物平时不准备好，就没办法应付突然发生的情况。现在武安君已经死了，而郑安平等又叛变了，国内没有良将而国外却有很多敌国，我因此而忧虑啊。”想用这话讥刺应侯。应侯内心恐惧，不知如何应对。蔡泽听说了，就前往秦国。

蔡泽是燕国人。游说了大大小小许多诸侯，都未得到赏识。他于是就找唐举看相，说：“我听说先生给李兑看相，说‘一百天内就能把持国政',有这回事么?”唐举说：“有啊。”蔡泽说：“你看我怎么样?”唐举仔细端详他说：“先生鼻子朝天，肩膀宽大，上额突出，凹鼻梁，罗圈腿。我听说圣人是不可貌相的，说的就是先生么?”蔡泽知道唐举在开他的玩笑，就说：“富贵我可以自己把握，我只是不知道我的寿命，想听听你的说法。”唐举说：“先生的寿命，从现在算起还有四十三年。”蔡泽笑着谢了他就走了。他对给他驾车的人说：“我要能吃好饭嚼肥肉，跃马飞奔，怀揣黄金印，腰系紫绶带，受到人主的尊重，吃肉富贵，四十三年足够了。”他到赵国，被赶了出来。到韩国、魏国，在路上被人抢走了锅。他听说应侯任用的郑安平、王稽都犯了重罪，应侯内心很惭愧，于是就西行进入秦国。

蔡泽见秦王前，派人放出话来触怒应侯：“燕国来的客人蔡泽，是天下雄俊弘辩的聪明人。他一见到秦王，秦王一定会为难你、罢掉你的相位。”应侯听到后说：“五帝三代的事，百家学说，我都了解，众多的辩士，我都挫败了，这个蔡泽怎么能使我困窘，罢掉我的相位呢?”派人召来蔡泽。蔡泽进来后，只是向应侯拱了拱手。应侯本来就不高兴，到召见蔡泽时，蔡泽态度又傲慢，应侯就责备蔡泽说：“你曾说要取代我做秦国的相国，有这回事么?”蔡泽回答说：“有。”应侯说：“想听听你的说法。”蔡泽说：“唉，您的见识怎么这么迟钝呢!按照自然规律，任务完成了就要离开。人的一生中身体健康，手脚灵便，耳朵听得清，眼睛看得清，心中明白事，这不就是士人的愿望吗?”应侯说：“是啊。”蔡泽说：“以仁为原则，以义为方针，行道施德，在天下能实现自己的志向，使天下人都心怀其德，乐生其世，都希望他能做自己的君王，这不是明智之人的希望吗?”应侯说：“是啊。”蔡泽又说：“有钱有势名闻天下，治理万物，使所有的事物都能各得其所；长寿安康，能享尽天年而不短命夭折，天下能继承他的统绪，守住他的基业，无止境地传下去；名副其实，恩泽远及千里之外，世世代代不断地称颂他，与天地共始终；这些不是符合大道、是圣人所说的吉祥善事吗?”应侯说：“是啊。”

蔡泽说：“像秦国的商鞅，楚国的吴起，越国的大夫种，他们的死法也是可美慕的吗?”应侯知道蔡泽想用话把他绕进去，就故意反着说：“有什么不可以?商鞅事奉孝公，终身没有二心，一心顾着公家而不顾自家；设立了刀锯等刑具用来禁止奸邪，用申明赏罚制度来达到治理的目标；推心置腹，坦露真诚，忍受怨恨，欺骗老友，俘虏了魏公子卬，安定了秦国的社稷，使百姓得到了实利，最后为秦国破敌擒将，扩地千里。吴起事楚悼王，使私事不能防害公务，谗佞不能损害忠良，不听取随声附和的言论，不采取不讲原则的行为，不因为危险而改变行动，实行正义之事不逃避困难，为君主称霸，为国家富强，不逃避灾祸和凶险。大夫种事奉越王句践，君主即使困窘受辱，他也尽忠而不松懈，君主即使绝望亡国，他也用尽自己的才能而不离去，成功而不骄傲，富贵而不怠惰。像这三个人，本来就是道义的榜样，忠诚的表率。因此君子因道义而死，视死如归；活着受辱不如死后享受光荣。士人本来就有杀身成名的追求，道义在哪里，士人就在哪里，即使死了也不遗憾。有什么不可以呢?”

蔡泽说：“天子圣明臣子贤能，这是天下最大的福气；国君明智臣子正直，这是国家的福气；父亲慈爱儿子孝顺，丈夫诚信妻子忠贞，这是家庭的福气。过去比干虽然忠诚却无法保存殷的社稷，子胥虽然聪明却不能使吴国保持完整，申生虽然孝顺却使晋国发生大乱。这些都是忠臣孝子，而国家与家庭都要么灭亡要么变乱，这是为什么呢?是因为没有明智的君主和贤明的父亲去听他们的，所以天下人都认为那做君做父的是可耻的，而同情那些做臣做子的。现在商鞅、吴起、大夫种作为人臣，没有错；但做君主的却不对。所以世人都说这三个人为国家建立了功勋却没有得到君主的感念，难道还美慕他们没遇到明主而死吗?如果等到死后才可以建立忠诚的名声，那么微子也不足以称为仁爱，孔子也不足以称为圣贤，管仲也不足以称为伟大。人立功难道不希望十全十美吗?性命与名声全能保全是最好的，其次才是光有了名声而丢了性命。坏了名声而只保全性命的是最下等。”于是应侯点头称对。

蔡泽稍稍抓到一点空子，顺势说：“商君、吴起、大夫种，他们作为人臣尽忠致功当然值得美慕，闳夭事奉文王，周公辅佐成王，不也是忠诚圣明么?从君臣关系来说，商君、吴起、大夫种与闳夭、周公相比，谁更值得美慕呢?”应侯说：“商君、吴起、大夫种比不上。”

蔡泽说：“您的君主在慈爱仁厚，对故人宽大，尊重智慧，与有道德的人交情深厚，坚守道义，不背弃忠臣等方面，与秦孝公、楚悼王、越王句践相比怎么样呢?”应侯说：“不知道会怎么样。”

蔡泽说：“现在您的君主在亲近忠臣方面没有超过孝公、楚悼王和越王句践，您出谋划策，能为君主安定危局、修明政治，治理混乱强化军事，排除祸患消灭灾难，扩大土地增加粮食，使国家富强，百姓富足，加强君主的权威，尊崇国家地位，显荣宗庙，使天下不敢欺侮冒犯君主，使君主的威望震慑海内，功业显明至万里之外，声名光辉传到千代，您与商君、吴起、大夫种相比怎么样?”应侯说：“我比不上他们。”

蔡泽说：“现在秦王亲近忠臣不忘旧情不如孝公、悼王、句践，而您的功绩宠爱亲信又比不上商君、吴起、大夫种，但您的爵禄地位的高贵、私人家产的富有都超过了这三人，如果您还不退位，恐怕灾祸会超过这三个人，我私下里真为您担心。

“老话说：“日中则移，月满则亏。'物盛则衰，这是天地间的自然规律。进退盈缩，与时变化，这是圣人应遵循的规律，因此说‘国家有道就出仕，国家无道就退隐’。圣人说‘飞龙出现在天上，对大人有利',‘不讲道义而得到的钱财与地位，对于我就像浮云一样无意义’。现在您的仇怨已经报复了，恩德也已经报答了，愿望都实现了，但还不另做打算，我私下里认为您做得不对。

“像翠鸟、鸿鹄、犀牛、大象，它们离死的处境并不是不远，而造成死亡的原因是诱饵的诱惑。苏秦、智伯的智力，不是不足以躲开侮辱、逃避死亡，而造成死亡的原因是迷惑于利益而不知适可而止。因此圣人制定了礼法节制欲望，征取人民的财富要有限度，役使民力要不违时节，要适可而止。所以志向不要太高，举动不要太骄傲，符合道义不要偏离，这样天下人就一直拥戴，功名禄位就能不断绝。从前齐桓公九合诸侯，一匡天下，到葵丘会盟时，产生了骄傲自大的情绪，很多国家因此而背叛了他。吴王夫差的军队天下无敌，他凭借他们的勇猛强大轻视诸侯，欺凌齐国和晋国，因此身死国亡。夏育、太史噭大喊一声就能吓倒敌军一大片，但他们却死在毫不起眼的人手上。这些都是因为达到鼎盛时却不愿意抽身而退，不愿意谦谨收敛。

“商君替秦孝公彰明法令，禁绝奸邪的根源，尊爵必赏，有罪必罚，统一权衡器具，校正度量器具，调整货币制度，废除井田制度，稳定百姓的职业，统一了人民的习俗，鼓励农耕，用尽土地的效益，一个家庭不做两种事，努力种田，积蓄粮食，熟悉临阵作战，因此秦一出兵就能扩张地盘，不出兵国家就会富足，因而使秦天下无敌，在诸侯中树立威名，成就秦国的基业。功业已经完成，商鞅就被车裂处死。楚国方圆数千里，作战的士卒有数百万，白起率领几万人的军队与楚国交战，第一仗就攻下了鄢陵，烧毁了夷陵，第二仗就向南吞并了蜀汉。又越过韩、魏去攻打	强大的赵国，向北在长平坑杀马服君赵奢之子赵括率领的四十余万人，血流成河，喧哗的声音像打雷，于是进而包围了邯郸，使秦有了称帝的资本。楚、赵是天下的强国，是秦的仇敌，从此之后，楚、赵都畏惧屈服不敢攻秦的原因，就是因为有白起的威势。白起亲自征服了七十多个城邑，大功告成之后，却被赐剑在杜邮自尽。吴起为楚悼王订立法律，削减大臣的权威，罢免没有才能的官员，废除无用的官职，削减不急需的官职，堵塞循私的请托，统一了楚国的风俗，禁止百姓游手好闲，精心训练耕战的士兵，向南收复了杨越，向北吞并了陈、蔡，粉碎了纵横家的游说，使说客们没法开口，他禁止结党营私，以此鼓励百姓，稳定了楚国的政局，兵震天下，靠武力使诸侯屈服。功业已经完成，最终被肢解而死。大夫种替越王深谋远虑，解除了会稽的危难，转亡为存，转辱为荣，铲除杂草重建都城，开辟田地来种植五谷，率领四方的人才，团结全国人民的力量，辅佐贤明的句践，向夫差复仇，终于打败了强大的吴国，使越国称霸天下。功劳是这样明显而确实，句践却最终忘恩负义地杀了他。这四个人，大功告成后却不肯离去，最后才大祸临头。这就是所谓能伸而不能屈，能往而不能返。范蠡明白这个道理，超然离开尘世，长久地作陶朱公。

“您没见过赌博的人吗?有的想孤注一掷，有的想下小注慢慢来，这些都是您所知道的。现在您身为秦相，出谋划策不用离开坐席，不用走出朝廷，坐在那里就可以制服诸侯，开拓三川之利来充实宜阳，截断羊肠的天险，堵住太行的道路，又封锁了范氏、中行氏的通道，使六国不能合纵，修筑了千里栈道，通向蜀汉，使天下都畏惧秦国，秦国的欲望也达到了，您的功业也成就了，这也到了秦国悠着一点下小注的时候了。这时您还不退隐，就是商君、白公、吴起、大夫种。我听说：‘用水作镜子可以看见面容，用人作镜子可以知道吉凶。’《尚书》说：‘成功之下，不可久处。'这四个人的灾祸，您为什么还不吸取教训呢?您为什么不在现在归还相印，让位给贤者，退隐到山川之中，一定会有伯夷廉让的美名，永远作应侯，世代保有封国，有许由、延陵季子让贤的名声，又有王子乔、赤松子一样的高寿，这比以灾祸为结局怎么样?如果您下不了决心自己离开，犹豫着不能决定，一定会有那四个人的祸患。《周易》说‘亢龙有悔’,说的就是能上不能下，能伸不能屈，能往而不能自己返回的人啊。希望您好好考虑。”

应侯说：“说得好。我听说‘有欲望而不知道满足，就会失去想要的东西；只知占有而不知停止，就会失去已有的东西’。幸而先生指教，范雎我恭敬地接受您的教诲。”于是就把蔡泽请入上座，作为上等宾客。

几天后，范雎入朝，对秦昭王说：“有位新从崤山东面来的客人名叫蔡泽，这个人是雄辩之士，明白三王之事，五霸的功业，人间万事及世态人情的变化，足以托付秦国的国政。臣见人很多，没有赶得上他的，我不如他。我斗胆推荐他。”秦昭王召见了蔡泽，与他谈话，非常喜欢，就拜他为客卿。应侯于是就称病请求归还相印。秦昭王强留范雎，范雎就自称病重。范雎不再做相国，昭王正赏识蔡泽的计策谋画，就拜蔡泽为相国，向东灭了周室。

蔡泽做秦相国几个月，有人说他的坏话，蔡泽害怕被杀，就称病归还相印，号称纲成君。蔡泽在秦国十多年，事奉秦昭王、孝文王、庄襄王。最后他事奉秦始皇，替秦出使燕国，三年后，燕派太子丹入秦为人质。

太史公说：韩非子说“衣袖长的善于舞蹈，金钱多的善于经商”,这话说得真对啊!范雎、蔡泽是世人所说的出类拔萃的辩士，但游说诸侯直到头发都白了却没得到机会的人，不是计策拙劣，而是他们游说的力量不够。当这两个人旅居到秦国，相继做卿相，建功于天下，其根本原因是强弱的形势不同。但士的遭遇也有偶然性，像这两个人一样贤能的人很多，却不能把才能全发挥出来，哪里说得完呢?但这两个人如果不是陷于困境，又怎能激发起他们奋发的志向呢?</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Fan Ju, whose polite name was Shu, was a man of the state of Wei. As an itinerant adviser to the feudal rulers, he hoped to obtain office under the king of Wei. But because his family was poor and he was lacking in resources, he first took service under the Wei palace counsellor Xu Jia.

Xu Jia was sent by King Zhao of Wei on a mission to the state of Qi. Fan Ju accompanied him, and they remained in Qi several months without being able to receive a reply on the matter they had come for. Meanwhile King Xiang of Qi, hearing of Fan Ju’s reputation for eloquence, sent someone to present him with ten catties of gold and gifts of beef and wine. Fan Ju declined the presents, not venturing to accept them. Xu Jia, hearing of the incident, was extremely angry, for he supposed that Fan Ju must have given Qi information on the secrets of the state of Wei in order to receive such gifts. He ordered Fan Ju to accept the beef and wine but to return the money. After they returned to Wei, Xu Jia, still angry with Fan Ju, reported the matter to the prime minister of Wei. The prime minister, Wei Qi, was a son of the ruling family of Wei. He too was incensed and ordered his stewards to beat Fan Ju. Fan Ju, his ribs broken and teeth knocked out, pretended to be dead, whereupon he was wrapped in a reed mat and dumped in the privy. There the guests who were drinking with the prime minister at the time, drunk, took turns pissing on him, deliberately heaping insult on him as a warning to others never to blurt out secrets. Still wrapped in the reed mat, Fan Ju said to the man guarding him, “If you can get me out of this, I’ll see that you are generously rewarded.” The guard accordingly asked to be allowed to dispose of the body in the mat. Wei Qi, drunk at the time, gave permission, and thus Fan Ju was able to escape. Later Wei Qi regretted his action and sent people to look for Fan Ju. But a man of Wei named Zheng Anping, hearing what had happened, spirited Fan Ju into hiding and kept him concealed, changing Fan Ju’s name to Zhang Lu.

At this time King Zhaoxiang of Qin had sent his master of guests Wang Ji on a mission to Wei. Zheng Anping arranged by some subterfuge to be among the servants waiting on Wang Ji. Wang Ji asked, “Does Wei have any worthy men that I could take back west with me?” Zheng Anping replied, “In my neighbourhood there is a Master Zhang Lu who would like to meet you and discuss the affairs of the world. But he has made certain enemies and does not dare be seen abroad in the daytime.” “Then bring him with you in the evening,” said Wang Ji. Zheng Anping accordingly went at night with Zhang Lu to see Wang Ji. They had not concluded their discussion when Wang Ji, realizing that Fan Ju was a man of worth, said, “Please be kind enough to wait for me south of the third post station.” Having privately promised to do so, Fan Ju left.

Wang Ji then took leave of Wei and, picking Fan Ju up along the way and putting him in his carriage, returned to Qin. They had reached Hu in Qin when they saw a carriage and outriders approaching from the west. Fan Ju said, “Who is this coming?” Wang Ji replied, “It is the marquis of Rang, the prime minister of Qin, on his way to the eastern districts.” Fan Ju said, “I have heard that the marquis of Rang exercises sole authority in Qin and hates to have visitors from the other feudal rulers entering the state. He may well make trouble for me — I had better hide in the carriage.” Before long the marquis of Rang arrived and, thanking Wang Ji for his mission, stopped the carriage to chat “Is anything new happening east of the pass?” he asked. “Nothing new,” said Wang Jr. “And are you not perhaps bringing back a visitor with you from one of the feudal lords? They’re no good, you know! They just cause confusion in other people’s states!” “I wouldn’t dare to,” said Wang Ji. The two men then parted. Fan Ju said, “I had heard that the marquis of Rang was a wise man, but in fact he is rather neglectful, isn’t he? Just now, he suspected there was someone in your carriage, but he forgot to have it searched.” Then Fan Ju stepped down from the carriage and set off at a run, saying, “He’s bound to have second thoughts!” The marquis had gone only ten li or more when, as Fan Ju predicted, he sent one of his outriders back to search the carriage. Finding no one, he let the matter end there. So Wang Ji and Fan Ju entered the capital city of Xianyang.

When Wang Ji had finished reporting on his mission, he took the opportunity to say to the Qin ruler, “In Wei there is a Master Zhang Lu who is a man of great eloquence. He said to me, ‘The king of Qin’s situation is as precarious as a stack of eggs. If he has me to advise him, he will be all right, but it is not something I can convey to him by letter!’ So I brought the man along.” The king of Qin was not convinced by this and merely ordered that Fan Ju be provided with lodging and simple fare. Fan Ju spent a year or more waiting for further instructions.

At this time King Zhaoxiang was already in his thirty-sixth year of rule (271 BC). In the south his forces had captured the Chu cities of Yan and Ying, and King Huai of Chu had died in confinement in Qin. In the east Qin had inflicted a defeat on Qi, and though King Min of Qi had for a time taken the title of emperor, he later abandoned it. Qin had also several times made trouble for the Three Jin, the states of Hann, Wei, and Zhao. But the king was weary of “men of great eloquence” and put no faith in them.

The marquis of Rang and Lord Huayang were younger brothers of King Zhaoxiang’s mother, Queen Dowager Xuan, while Lord Jingyang and Lord Gaoling were both younger brothers of King Zhaoxiang by the same mother. The marquis of Rang served as prime minister, while the other three men took turns serving as military leader. All were enfeoffed with cities, and because of their kinship with the Queen Dowager, their private wealth exceeded that of the ruling house. Later, when the marquis of Rang became military leader of Qin, he hoped to cross through the states of Hann and Wei and attack the Qi city of Gangshou so that he could broaden his fief in Tao. At this point Fan Ju submitted a letter to the king which said:

“I have heard that when an enlightened ruler conducts his government, persons of merit never fail to receive reward, and persons of ability never fail to receive office. Those whose achievements are great receive generous emolument, those whose merits are many are awarded noble rank, and those who can govern the masses are given high office. Hence persons who lack ability do not dare accept assignment, while those who have ability are not allowed to remain in the shade. Therefore if you think my words worth heeding, please permit me to put them into practice and so bring increase and benefit to your regime. And if you think them not worth heeding, then it is pointless to detain me here any longer. “The saying has it that the mediocre ruler rewards those he loves and punishes those he hates. But the enlightened ruler is not like this. His rewards go only to those with merit, and his penalties go only to those judged guilty of crime. Now although I may not even be worth the trouble it takes to haul me before the executioner’s block or subject me to the blow of the axe, I would hardly venture to take up Your Majesty’s time with mere nonsense. And although you might dismiss me as a worthless person, one lightly to be scorned, you would surely think it a grave matter to suspect the one who recommended me of playing false with you, would you not?

“I have heard that Zhou has its Zhiai, Song its Jielu, Liang its Xuanli, and Chu its Hepu. These four precious jewels were produced by the earth but at first were overlooked even by expert craftsmen, though they have since become objects renowned throughout the world. Is it not possible, then, that among the persons cast aside by the sage ruler there are those who can enrich the state?

“I have heard that if one is looking for someone who can enrich his family, he searches throughout the state. But if he is looking for one who can enrich the state, he searches among all the feudal rulers in the empire. So when there is an enlightened ruler in the world, the other feudal rulers cannot monopolize those who are good at enriching. Why? Because the enlightened ruler grabs them for his own embellishment. “Just as a good physician understands what will bring life or death to his patient, so a sage ruler perceives what will bring success or failure to his undertakings. If it brings benefit, he carries it out, if it brings harm, he discards it, and if he is in doubt, he tries a little of it. Even if the sages Shun or Yu came back to life today, they could find no fault with this. “Words that are truly pertinent I would not venture to entrust to a letter. And those that are shallow would not be worth the heeding. I wonder if it is because I am stupid that I have failed to stir Your Majesty’s heart? Or could it be because the person who recommended me is unworthy that I am not employed? If it is neither, then may I beg to be granted a moment when Your Majesty is not engaged in outings and excursions so I may gaze afar on your countenance? If at that time I utter one word that is ineffectual, may I be condemned to the axe!”

King Zhaoxiang was very pleased with the letter and, apologizing to Wang Ji, sent a relay carriage to fetch Fan Ju.

So Fan Ju was granted an interview at the detached palace. Pretending not to know his way around, Fan Ju wandered into the passageway leading to the inner palace. When the king arrived, the eunuchs in charge angrily pushed him out of the passageway, saying, “The King is coming!” Fan Ju, still dissembling, said, “Qin has a king? I thought Qin just had the Queen Dowager and the marquis of Rang!” He hoped in this way to rouse the ire of King Zhaoxiang. When King Zhaoxiang arrived and heard the eunuchs wrangling with Fan Ju, he led Fan Ju into the hall and, apologizing, said, “I should have received your instruction in person long ago, but I happened to be very much pressed by the Yiqu affair and every morning and evening was obliged to consult with the Queen Dowager. Now, however, the Yiqu affair is settled and so I am able to receive your instruction. I fear you will find me pitifully ignorant, but I will do my best to receive you as a guest.” Fan Ju declared himself unworthy of such politeness, while among the various officials who were present at the interview, there were none who did not look on with awe and amazement.

The king of Qin then dismissed all those around him, until there was no one left in the hall. Kneeling politely on his mat, he said, “Now, sir, may I ask what instruction you have to give me?” “Yes, of course,” said Fan Ju. After a while the king, once more kneeling politely on his mat, said, “May I ask, sir, what instruction you have to give me?” “Yes, of course,” said Fan Ju. This happened three times when the king of Qin, still kneeling, said, “Then, sir, is it not your intention to favour me with any instruction?” “Oh, no,” said Fan Ju. “But I have heard that long ago, when Lü Shang met with King Wen of the Zhou dynasty, he was nothing more than a fisherman angling on the banks of the Wei. At that time their association was a very shallow one. Later, after Lü Shang had spoken to the king, the latter appointed him grand tutor and returned with him in the same carriage to the capital, because their discussions had become more profound. Therefore King Wen was able to reap benefit through Lü Shang and in the end to become ruler of all under heaven. If King Wen had continued to treat Lü Shang in a shallow manner and had not held profound discussions with him, then Zhou would never have enjoyed the position of Son of Heaven, and Wen and Wu would never have brought to completion their royal undertaking. “Now I am a traveller from another state and my association with Your Majesty is a shallow one. And yet the matters I wish to speak about all pertain to reforms in the ruler’s conduct of affairs and touch upon his own flesh and blood. I would like to speak in utter frankness and loyalty, stupid though I may be, but I do not know yet how Your Majesty will respond. Therefore when you questioned me three times, I did not venture to reply.

“It is not fear that causes me to hesitate. I am quite aware that if I speak out before you today, I may well face execution tomorrow, and yet I dare not remain silent. For if Your Majesty is truly willing to put my words into action, then mere death would be no grief to me, exile would be no sorrow, and I might paint my body with lacquer to become a leper, or loose my hair like a madman, without any sense of shame. “Sages such as the Five Emperors have died, as have men of benevolence such as the kings of the Three Dynasties, worthy men such as the Five Hegemons, strong men such as Wu Huo and Ren Bi, and brave men such as Cheng Jing, Meng Ben, Prince Qingji, or Xia Yu. Death is a thing no human being can escape. But if, while facing the inescapable, I can at the same time be of some assistance to Qin, that would fulfil my most fervent desire. Then what grief would it be to me? “Wu Zixu hid himself in a sack and so escaped through the Zhao Pass, travelling by night, hiding by day, till he reached the Ling River, when he had not a morsel to put in his mouth. He crawled on his knees, inched over the ground, bowed his head, bared his arms, drummed on his stomach, and blew a flute, begging in the marketplace of Wu, yet in the end he raised Wu to greatness and made its ruler, King Helü, a hegemon. If I could offer all my counsels as did Wu Zixu, then although I might be condemned to prison for the remainder of my days and never again admitted into your presence, as long as my advice was put into practice, what sorrow would it be to me? “Ji Zi and Jieyu painted their bodies with lacquer to induce leprous sores and loosed their hair to feign madness, though it proved no benefit to their rulers.150 But if by imitating Ji Zi’s actions I could assist a ruler whom I deem worthy, that would be a great honour for me. How could it be a source of shame? My only fear would be that after I am gone the men of the world, observing that I exerted the utmost loyalty and still met with death, would seal their lips, stay their feet, and never again be willing to journey to Qin. “If you should be intimidated by the sternness of the Queen Dowager and misled by the machinations of treacherous ministers, dwelling deep within the confines of the palace, forever shielded by your tutors, remaining all your life misled and confused and never waking to the treachery, then at worst you might bring destruction to the entire ruling family, and at best you would face danger to your person. This is the only thing that I fear. As to distress or insult to myself, or the threat of death or exile, these I would not venture to fear. If by dying I can bring order to Qin, then I would be of greater worth dead than alive.”

Still kneeling, the king of Qin said, “What is this you are saying, sir! The state of Qin is situated far away here on the border, and I am ignorant and unworthy. But since you have been kind enough to come all this distance, it must be that Heaven is troubling you for my sake, tasking you with the preservation of the ancestral temples of Qin’s former kings. If I may receive instruction from you, it will mean that Heaven smiles on the former kings and has not cast me aside. Why then do you speak as you do, sir? “No matter how great or small the matter, whether it touches upon the Queen Dowager or the great officials, I beg you to give me all the instruction you have and never doubt my motives!” Fan Ju bowed in acknowledgment and the king of Qin returned the bow.

Fan Ju said, “Your Majesty’s state is well protected on all four sides. To the north is Sweet Springs and Valley Mouth, to the south the long-stretching Jing and Wei rivers, to the right Long and Shu, to the left the Hangu Pass and Shang Slope.151 With a striking force of 1,000,000 men and 1,000 war chariots, if it is profitable to do so, you may venture forth to attack; if it is not, you may guard your stronghold. It is the kind of territory fit for a ruler. Your people are cowardly in private vendettas but brave in public warfare — the kind of subjects fit for a ruler. Thus you possess both these assets. “If Qin were to utilize the bravery of its soldiers and the plentitude of its chariots and riders to impose its will on the other feudal lords, it would be like loosing the swift hound Hanlu to strike down a lame rabbit! Qin could advance to the position of a hegemon king! “But none of its ministers are worthy of their posts, and so for fifteen years now the passes have been closed and Qin has not ventured to show its troops east of the mountains. This is because the marquis of Rang has been disloyal in plotting affairs for Qin, and Your Majesty’s plans have been in some respects amiss.” The king of Qin, kneeling, said, “I want to hear where my plans have been amiss!”

But many of the king’s attendants were eavesdropping on the conversation, and Fan Ju was afraid to speak of internal matters. Therefore he spoke of foreign affairs in order to observe what the king of Qin’s response would be. Moving closer, Fan Ju said, “The marquis of Rang hopes to cross through Hann and Wei and attack the city of Gangshou in Qi, but this is not good planning. If he sets out with too small a force, he will not have strength enough to inflict damage on Qi. And if he calls out too large a one, he will do harm to Qin. I believe Your Majesty’s plan is to send out a small force and then have Hann and Wei call out all their troops, but that is hardly fair to them. And just because Qi, an allied state, chooses to be unfriendly, can you cross through someone else’s state to attack it? This is bad planning indeed! “In the past King Min of Qi marched south to attack Chu, defeating its army, killing its leader, and expanding Qi’s territory by 1,000 li . But Qi in the end could not retain possession of an inch of that land, not because it did not want the land, but because the circumstances would not permit it. For when the other feudal rulers saw that Qi’s troops were exhausted and that ruler and subject were at loggerheads, they called out their own men and attacked Qi, infliciting a defeat. Its officers suffered shame, its soldiers bowed down, and all blamed the king, saying, ‘Who made this plan?’ The king said, ‘Tian Wen made it!’ and the great ministers thereupon revolted and drove Tian Wen from the state. Thus Qi’s great defeat came about because in attacking Chu it played into the hands of Hann and Wei. This is what is called lending arms to bandits and providing rations to thieves. “Your Majesty would do best to cultivate friendly relations with distant states and attack those close by. Then if you win an inch of land, it will be your inch, and if you win a foot, it will be your foot. To do otherwise and attack those who are far away is surely an error! “In past times the state of Zhongshan measured 500 li square. But Zhao all by itself swallowed it up, winning merit, gaining fame, and annexing all the benefits to itself so that no one in the world could harm it. “Now the states of Hann and Wei occupy the centre of the realm, the pivot of the world. If Your Majesty wishes to become a hegemon, you must ally yourself with the centre of the realm, the pivot of the world, and thereby overawe Chu and Zhao. If Chu is strong, join up with Zhao; if Zhao is strong, join up with Chu. And if you can join with both Chu and Zhao, then Qi will be terrified, and if Qi is terrified, it will come with humble words and rich gifts to court favour with Qin. With Qi on your side, you can make Hann and Wei your captives.” The king said, “Actually, I have wanted for some time to become friendly with Wei. But Wei is a country of many shifts and I have been unable to win its friendship. May I ask how I should go about winning over Wei?” Fan Ju replied, “Court it with humble phrases and rich gifts. If that does not work, bribe it with territorial concessions. And if that does not work, call out your troops and attack it!” The king said, “I will honour your instructions.” He appointed Fan Ju a “guest minister” for the planning of military affairs. Heeding Fan Ju’s advice, he dispatched the fifth rank counsellor Wan to attack Wei, where he captured Huai. Two years later he captured Xingqiu.

The guest minister Fan Ju spoke once more with King Zhaoxiang, saying: “The territories of Qin and Hann are interwoven like the strands of an embroidery. And Hann’s existence is to Qin like a wood-borer to a tree, or a disease of the heart or belly to a man. As long as there is no drastic upset in the world, then it is all right. But if there should be some drastic upset, then no state will cause greater worry to Qin than Hann! Your Majesty would do best to take over Hann.” King Zhaoxiang said, “I would like very much to take over Hann. But suppose Hann will not listen — what will I do then?” Fan Ju replied, “Why would Hann fail to listen? If you send troops to attack Xingyang, then the road to Gong and Chenggao will be cut off. And in the north this will block the road to the Taihang Mountains, so the army stationed in Shangdang cannot come south. Thus by sending your troops out in a single attack on Xingyang, you can cut the state of Hann into three pieces. If Hann sees that it is faced with certain destruction, why would it fail to listen? And If Hann listens to you, then you can lay plans to become a hegemon.” “Very good,” said the king, and he made preparations to send an envoy to Hann.

Fan Ju day by day enjoyed greater intimacy with the king. After his suggestions had been heeded for several years, he requested a moment of the king’s leisure and spoke to him as follows: “When I was living east of the mountains I heard about Tian Wen in Qi, but I never heard that Qi had a king. I heard about the Queen Dowager, the marquis of Rang, and lords Huayang, Gaoling, and Jingyang in Qin, but I never heard that Qin had a king. “The one who wields power in the state is called the king, the one who can dole out benefit or injury is called the king, the one who has the authority to kill or let live is called the king. Yet now the Queen Dowager wields authority without glancing in your direction, the marquis of Rang dispatches envoys without reporting to you on the matter, lords Huayang and Jingyang hand out penalties without compunction, and Lord Gaoling promotes and demotes men without asking leave. With four persons of such eminence, I have never heard of the state escaping peril. Where four persons of such eminence preside, one may say there is no king. How can the king’s authority fail to be subverted? How can he hope to issue his own orders? “I have heard that one who is skilled at governing a country will make certain that his authority is firmly established within the state, and that his word is respected abroad. Yet the envoys of the marquis of Rang have usurped the king’s authority, deciding on relations with the other feudal rulers, handing out fiefs to the world, attacking states, punishing opponents, and no one dares disobey them. If there is victory in battle, if the attacks succeed, then the benefits go to the marquis of Rang’s fief in Tao and the losses are borne by the other feudal lords. And if the battles end in defeat, then it is the common people of Qin who are moved to anger, and it is Qin’s altars of the soil and grain that will suffer misfortune in the end. “The Book of Odes says: If the fruits of the tree are too many they will break the branches, and if they break the branches, they will injure the tree’s heart.Enlarging the other cities endangers the capital, heaping too great honour on a subject demeans the ruler.153 “When Cui Shu and Nao Chi wielded power in Qi, they shot the king in the thigh, or pulled out the king’s tendons and hung him from the beam of the ancestral temple so that in one night he died. When Li Dui wielded power in Zhao, he imprisoned the ruler Zhufu at Sand Hill and after 100 days he died of starvation.154 Now I hear that in Qin the Queen Dowager and the marquis of Rang manage affairs, with lords Gaoling, Huayang, and Jingyang assisting them, and it is as though the king of Qin did not exist. The situation is like that under Nao Chi or Li Dui. “The reason the rulers of the Three Dynasties lost their states was that they delegated power to others, while they amused themselves drinking or raced about hunting and shooting, paying no heed to government affairs. Those to whom they delegated power envied worth and ability, blocking the advancement of those below them, deceiving those above them, and thereby promoting their private interests and failing to consider the interests of the rulers. And the rulers never woke up to this, so that eventually they lost their states. “Now among the holders of noble rank and the higher level ministers, as well as among Your Majesty’s personal attendants, there are none who are not the marquis of Rang’s men. When I see Your Majesty standing all alone in court, I cannot help fearing that, after your years of life are ended, those who rule the state of Qin will not be Your Majesty’s descendants!” King Zhaoxiang, thoroughly alarmed at these words, said, “You are quite right!” He then demoted the Queen Dowager and obliged the marquis of Rang and lords Gaoling, Huayang, and Jingyang to leave the capital and go beyond the Pass. He honoured Fan Ju with the post of prime minister, relieving the marquis of Rang of the seals of office and sending him to his fief in Tao. The government was ordered to supply wagons and oxen for the move, and a train of over 1,000 vehicles arrived at the Pass. The officials at the Pass, examining the contents, found that the precious vessels and other rare and unusual objects exceeded those in the possession of the royal house.

Qin enfeoffed Fan Ju in the region of Ying, giving him the title of marquis of Ying. The time was the forty-first year of King Zhaoxiang’s reign (266 BC).

Fan Ju thus became prime minister of Qin, but Qin knew him by the name Zhang Lu. The people of Wei, his native state, unaware of his whereabouts, supposed that Fan Ju had died long ago. When Wei heard that Qin was about to march east to attack Hann and Wei, it sent Fan Ju’s old employer Xu Jia as an envoy to Qin. Fan Ju, learning of this, set off incognito, wearing shabby clothes and proceeding alone and on foot to the government lodge to see Xu Jia. When Xu Jia saw him, he was greatly startled and exclaimed, “Fan Shu! Are you alive and well?”155 “I am,” said Fan Ju. “And have you come to Qin to offer advice?” asked Xu Jia with a laugh. “No,” said Fan Ju. “But some time ago I got into trouble with the prime minister of Wei and so I fled here to Qin. How would I dare offer advice?” “And what are you doing now?” asked Xu Jia. “I am working as a hired man for someone,” said Fan Ju. Xu Jia, feeling sorry for Fan Ju, invited him to stay a while and have something to eat and drink. “How hard up you look, Fan Shu!” he said, and taking one of his robes of coarse silk, he gave it to Fan Ju as a present. Then he began to question Fan Ju, saying, “Lord Zhang, the prime minister of Qin — do you know him? I hear he enjoys great favour with the king and all matters of every kind are decided by him. The success or failure of this mission I am on depends entirely on this man. You wouldn’t happen to know anyone who has access to him, would you, my boy?” Fan Ju said, “My employer knows him very well, and even I am allowed into his presence on occasion. Let me arrange an interview with Lord Zhang for you.” “Ah, but my horse is ailing and the axle of my carriage is broken,” said Xu Jia. “And if I don’t have a large carriage and a team of four, I would never dare pay a call.” Fan Ju said, “I will ask my employer if I can borrow a large carriage and team of four for you.”

Fan Ju returned to his quarters, called out a large carriage and team of four and, driving it himself, fetched Xu Jia and drove with him to the office of the Qin prime minister. As they approached the office, the people in the office, recognizing the carriage from a distance, all disappeared from sight, which struck Xu Jia as peculiar When they reached the gate of the prime minister’s residence, Fan Ju said, “Wait for me. I’ll go in ahead and inform the prime minister of your arrival.” Xu Jia waited by the gate, but after sitting in the carriage for some time, he said to the gatekeeper, “I wonder why Fan Shu doesn’t come out?” “There’s no Fan Shu here,” said the gatekeeper. “The person who came with me in the carriage a while ago and went inside!” said Xu Jia. “That was Lord Zhang, our prime minister,” said the gatekeeper. Xu Jia realized to his astonishment that he had been tricked. Getting down on his knees and baring his arms, he asked the gatekeeper to convey his confession of guilt. Fan Ju, surrounded by curtains and with a host of attendants, received him in audience. Xu Jia bowed his head and acknowledged that he was deserving of death. “I had not imagined you could have risen so high above the blue clouds!” he said. “I will never again venture to read the world’s books or comment on the world’s affairs. I have committed a crime for which I deserve to be boiled alive, though with your permission I may perhaps be allowed to take myself far off to the lands of the Hu and Mo barbarians. My life and death are in your hands.” Fan Ju said, “How many are your crimes?” “Though I plucked out the hairs of my beard to tally them all, they would not suffice!” “No,” said Fan Ju. “Your crimes are only three. Long ago, in the time of King Zhao of Chu, Shen Baoxu saved Chu by driving back the armies of Wu. The king of Chu wanted to enfeoff him with 5,000 households in Chu, but he refused to accept, saying that he had done what he did simply because his ancestral graves were in Chu. Now the graves of my ancestors are in Wei, and yet in the past you supposed that I had betrayed Wei to the state of Qi and spoke ill of me to Wei Qi. That was your first crime. “When Wei Qi subjected me to shame by putting me in the privy, you did not stop him. That was your second crime. And when the drunkards took turns pissing on me, you could stand to see it happen — your third crime! “Nevertheless, you will not be subjected to the death penalty, because of the kindness expressed by a coarse silk garment and the concern showed for an old friend. Because of those I am setting you free.” Thus Xu Jia’s apologies were accepted and Fan Ju went in to speak with King Zhaoxiang, who decided to dismiss Xu Jia and send him back to Wei.

When Xu Jia came to take leave of Fan Ju, the latter prepared a great banquet, inviting all the envoys of the other feudal rulers and sitting with them in the upper part of the hall, where vast quantities of food and drink were set out. But he seated Xu Jia in the lower part of the hall, had chopped hay and beans placed before him, and stationed two tattooed criminals on either side to force him to eat in horse fashion. Then he berated him, saying, “Tell the king of Wei this for me — he had better bring me the head of Wei Qi at once! If not, I’ll massacre every person in the Wei capital of Daliang!” When Xu Jia returned to Wei, he reported this to Wei Qi. Wei Qi fled in terror to Zhao, hiding at the home of Lord Pingyuan, a prince of Zhao.

After Fan Ju had become prime minister, Wang Ji, the master of guests who first introduced him to the king, said to Fan Ju, “There are three things you can never know, and three things you can do nothing about once it is too late. When the ruler may pass away — that’s the first thing you can never know. When you yourself may suddenly take leave of life — that’s the second thing you can never know. And when I may suddenly end tumbled in a ditch — that’s the third thing you can never know. Once the ruler has passed away, then it will be too late to regret what you might have done for me. Once you yourself have suddenly taken leave, then it will be too late for such regrets. And once I have suddenly ended tumbled in a ditch, then it will be too late!” Fan Ju, troubled by these words, went in and spoke to the king, saying, “If it had not been for Wang Ji’s loyalty to the state, no one would have allowed me to enter the Hangu Pass. And if it had not been for Your Majesty’s sageliness and worth, no one would have thought of elevating me to high office. Now I have advanced to the post of prime minister and am ranked among the marquises, yet Wang Ji’s office is still that of master of guests. This is surely not what he expected when he first allowed me to enter Qin!” King Zhaoxiang then summoned Wang Ji and honoured him with the post of governor of Hedong, not requiring him to submit government reports for the first three years. At Fan Ju’s recommendation, he also appointed Zheng Anping, Fan Ju’s old benefactor in Wei, to the position of general. Fan Ju used his private wealth to repay all those who had helped him when he was starving and in distress. Persons who aided him with no more than a single meal invariably received their reward, but those who had so much as glared at him angrily were likewise paid back in full.

When Fan Ju had been prime minister of Qin for two years, in the forty-second year of King Zhaoxiang’s reign (265 BC), Qin advanced east, attacking the Hann cities of Shaoqu and Gaoping and capturing them.

King Zhaoxiang of Qin, hearing that Fan Ju’s old enemy Wei Qi was at the home of Lord Pingyuan, wanted to help Fan Ju carry out his revenge. So, feigning a friendly tone, he wrote a letter to Lord Pingyuan, saying, “I have heard of your high ideals and would like very much to associate with you on terms of simple friendship. If you will be good enough to visit me, I wish to spend ten days drinking with you.” Lord Pingyuan was fearful of Qin and, accepting the letter at face value, journeyed to Qin to visit King Zhaoxiang. After he and King Zhaoxiang had drunk together for several days, the king said, “Long ago, when King Wen of the Zhou acquired the services of Lü Shang, he addressed him as Grand Duke, and when Duke Huan of Qi acquired Guan Zhong, he addressed him as Uncle. Now Lord Fan is in like manner an Uncle to me. Lord Fan’s enemy is staying at your home. I would like you to send someone to go and fetch his head. If not, I will not permit you to leave the Pass.” Long Pingyuan replied, “When one is eminent he cultivates friends because he may some day be humble, and when he is rich he cultivates friends because he may some day be poor. Wei Qi is a friend of mine. Even if he were at my home, I would never hand him over. And in fact he is no longer there.” King Zhaoxiang then sent a letter to the king of the state of Zhao, saying, “Your younger brother is here in Qin, and Wei Qi, the enemy of our Lord Fan, is at the home of Lord Pingyuan in Zhao. You had better send someone to bring Wei Qi’s head here as quickly as possible. Otherwise I will call out my troops and attack Zhao, and I will also see to it that your younger brother does not get out of the Hangu Pass!” King Xiaocheng of Zhao dispatched soldiers to surround the house of Lord Pingyuan with all speed. Wei Qi fled in the night, and then went to call on the Zhao prime minister, Yu Qing. Yu Qing, convinced that he would never be able to reason with the king of Zhao, divested himself of the seals of the prime minister of Zhao and fled into hiding with Wei Qi. Believing that there were none of the other feudal lords whom they could turn to in such an emergency, they hurried to the Wei capital of Daliang, hoping that Lord Xinling, a prince of Wei, would arrange for them to take refuge in Chu. But when Lord Xinling learned of the situation, he hesitated out of fear of Qin and was unwilling to grant them an interview. “What sort of person is Yu Qing?” he asked. At that time a man named Hou Ying was attending him, and he replied, “It is no easy matter to judge a man correctly, or for a man to be correctly judged by others! Yu Qing, wearing straw sandals and shouldering a sunshade, had a single interview with the king of Zhao and the king presented him with a pair of white jade discs and 100 catties of gold. A second interview and he was honoured with a high ministerial post, a third interview and he received the seals of the prime minister and was enfeoffed as a marquis of 10,000 households. At that time the whole world scrambled to get to know him. “Wei Qi, because he was in trouble and hard pressed, turned to Yu Qing. And Yu Qing, not daring to consider the lofty rank and emolument he would be losing, took off the seals of prime minister, cast aside his marquisate of 10,000 households, and escaped into hiding. But now this gentleman who is in deep trouble comes to you, Prince, and all you say is, ‘What sort of person is he?’ Truly it is no easy matter to judge a man correctly, or for a man to be judged correctly by others!” Lord Xinling, much chagrined, sent a carriage to the outskirts of the city to fetch the two men. But when Wei Qi learned that Lord Xinling had at first objected to granting him an interview, he was so angry that he cut his own throat. The king of Zhao, receiving word of this, was thus able in the end to turn over Wei Qi’s head to Qin. King Zhaoxiang of Qin then permitted Lord Pingyuan to return to Zhao.

King Zhaoxiang, forty-third year (264 BC): Qin attacked and captured the Hann regions of Fen and Xing and proceeded to fortify the city of Guangwu on the Yellow River.

Five years later, King Zhaoxiang, employing a strategy suggested by Fan Ju, the marquis of Ying, spread false rumours among the men of Zhao to deceive them. As a result, Zhao relieved Lian Po of command of the Zhao forces and replaced him with Zhao Kuo, the son of Lord Mafu. Qin inflicted a crushing defeat on Zhao at Changping and went on to besiege the Zhao capital city of Handan. Later, however, the marquis of Ying had a falling out with the Qin general Bai Qi, Lord Wuan, and spoke slanderously of him, bringing about his death. Qin also ordered Zheng Anping, Fan Ju’s old benefactor from Wei, to carry out a strike against Zhao, but when Zheng Anping was surrounded by the Zhao forces and hard pressed, he surrendered to Zhao along with the 20,000 soldiers under his command. Fan Ju, the marquis of Ying, spread a mat of straw and asked to be punished for his crime. (According to Qin law, if a person whom one has recommended is guilty of a misdeed, the recommender suffers the same punishment as the perpetrator of the misdeed.) It was judged that the marquis of Ying should be punished by having his three sets of relatives taken into custody. King Zhaoxiang, however, did not wish to do anything that would discomfort the marquis of Ying, and he accordingly circulated an order throughout the state that anyone venturing even to refer to the affair of Zheng Anping would be guilty of the same crime as Zheng himself. He also showered gifts of food and goods on the marquis of Ying and treated him with greater favour each day in order to reassure him. Two years later, however, Wang Ji, whom Fan Ju had also recommended and who was governor of Hedong, was accused of having secret dealings with the other feudal rulers and was condemned to death. The marquis of Ying grew more and more uneasy with each day.

One day when King Zhaoxiang was holding court, he heaved a sigh. The marquis of Ying stepped forward and said, “I have heard that if the ruler has worries, the minister should work to relieve them; and if the ruler suffers disgrace, the minister should die. Now Your Majesty appears at court in this state of worry — may I ask to receive the punishment that is my due?” King Zhaoxiang said, “I hear that the iron swords of Chu are sharp and its entertainers are clumsy. If its iron swords are sharp, then its fighting men will be valorous, and if its entertainers are clumsy, then the ruler will turn his thoughts to distant campaigns. And if the ruler begins to think of distant campaigns and has valorous men at his command, I fear that Chu may have designs on Qin! “Unless one stores up articles ahead of time, he will have no way to meet sudden needs. Now Lord Wuan is already dead and Zheng Anping and his men have turned against me. I have no good generals here at home, but many enemy states abroad. That is what causes me worry!” The king wished in this way to inspire the marquis of Ying to greater effort. But the marquis in his anxiety did not know how to respond. Cai Ze, hearing of the situation, thereupon journeyed to Qin.

Cai Ze was a native of the state of Yan. He travelled around to advance his studies and seek employment with the feudal rulers, visiting a number of states both large and small, but met with no success. He asked Tang Ju to examine his face and tell his fortune, saying, “I hear, Master, that you examined Li Dui and predicted that within 100 days he would take over the affairs of a state. Is that true?” “I did.” “And what would you say about me?” Tang Ju looked carefully at Cai Ze and then said with a laugh, “You, now, snub-nosed, giant-shouldered, bulging forehead, wrinkles on your nose, bandy legs — I’ve heard that sages are not much to look at — perhaps that applies to you.” Cai Ze knew that Tang Ju was joking and so he said, “Wealth and honour I can get for myself. But I don’t know how long I’ll live. That’s what I want to hear.” Tang Ju said, “As for your life span, you’ve got forty-three more years.” Cai Ze laughed, thanked him, and took his leave. Later Cai Ze said to his carriage driver, “Plenty of grain, fat meat to chew on, dashing around with fast horses, seals of yellow gold in my robe, purple cords of office tied at my waist, bowing before the ruler — if I can eat meat and enjoy that kind of wealth and honour, then forty-three years will be enough!” Leaving Tang Ju, Cai Ze went to Zhao, but he was expelled from the state. He went to Hann and Wei, but had his cooking pot stolen along the way. He heard that the marquis of Ying had recommended Zheng Anping and Wang Ji for office, but that both men had committed grave crimes against the state of Qin, causing serious embarrassment to the marquis of Ying. Cai Ze thereupon journeyed west to Qin.

Hoping to gain an interview with King Zhaoxiang, he sent someone to incite the marquis of Ying to anger by announcing, “Cai Ze, a visitor from Yan, is a man of extraordinary talent, one of the most eloquent and knowledgeable men in the world. If he once gains an interview with the king of Qin, the king is certain to make trouble for you and deprive you of your position!” When the marquis of Ying heard this, he said, “I already know all about the Five Emperors and the Three Dynasties of antiquity, and I can refute any amount of eloquence put forward by these talkers. How is this man going to make trouble for me and steal my position away?” Then he sent someone to summon Cai Ze. When Cai Ze entered, he bowed curtly to the marquis. The marquis was put out to begin with, and when he saw Cai Ze and met with this display of arrogance, he began to berate him, saying, “I hear you’ve been spreading word around that you want to replace me as prime minister of Qin. Is that true?” “It is,” was the reply. “And may I hear how you intend to do it?” said the marquis. Cai Ze said, “Ah, how slow you are to understand! As the four seasons take their round, so the achiever must give ground! While one is alive, to have sturdy limbs, nimble hands and feet, sharp ears and eyes, and a mind that is sage and wise — this is what a man wishes for, is it not?” “Yes,” said the marquis. Cai Ze said, “To embody benevolence, cling to righteousness, practise the Way and dispense its blessings, to realize one’s ambitions in the world, be welcomed, admired and respected by the world, so that everyone wishes to have him for their ruler — is this not what a man of wisdom and eloquence hopes for?” “Yes,” said the marquis. Cai Ze said, “Wealth, honour, approbation, glory, helping the ten thousand things to attain order and completion, enabling each to find its place; a full life span, living out the years Heaven gave you without injury, everyone in the world carrying on his respective line, pursuing his undertakings, handing them down so they never come to an end; name and reality of the highest purity, blessings flowing out 1,000 miles, age after age singing praises without end, as long-lasting as Heaven and earth themselves — these are the marks of the Way and its virtue, these are what the sages call good fortune and happy outcome, are they not?” “Yes,”said the marquis.

Cai Ze said, “To be like the statesmen Lord Shang of Qin, Wu Qi of Chu, and Dafu Zhong of Yue — that’s what one should wish for, then?” The marquis of Ying knew that Cai Ze was trying to use his arguments to force him into a corner, but he pretended to go along. “Yes, why not?” he said. “When Gongsun Yang or Lord Shang served Duke Xiao of Qin, he did his utmost without considering twice, gave all thought to public concerns and none to private ones. He established the penalties of the saw and knife in order to put an end to nefarious actions, made sure that rewards and punishments were carried out unfailingly so as to bring about good government. He laid bare the true feelings of his heart and mind, at times incurring enmity or censure, sometimes deceiving old friends, as when he seized the Wei leader Gongzi An, but bringing safety to Qin’s altars of the soil and grain and profit to its people. So for the sake of Qin he captured enemy generals, smashed armies, and snatched 1,000 li of territory. “When Wu Qi served King Dao of Chu, he made certain that private interests could not harm the public good, that slander could not darken true loyalty. His words were not shaped merely to be agreeable nor his actions merely to be acceptable. Danger did not deflect him from a course of action, and in observing right he did not turn aside from difficulty. In working to make the ruler a hegemon and to strengthen the state, he did not hesitate to face misfortune or evil. “When Dafu Zhong served the king of Yue, though the ruler was troubled and disgraced, Dafu Zhong exerted all his loyalty without ever slacking; though the ruler faced destruction, he exhausted his abilities and never deserted his post. Though he gained merit, he never boasted; though honoured and wealthy, he was never arrogant or lazy. “These three men in fact represent the ultimate in righteous conduct, the model of loyalty. Therefore the gentleman, when faced with difficulties, will die for what is right, for then he looks on death as his destination. Rather than live in disgrace, he prefers to die in glory. He is fully prepared to sacrifice himself for the sake of his name; so long as it is in the cause of right, he will die without regret. So why not wish to be like these men?”

Cai Ze said, “ When the sovereign is a sage and his ministers are worthy, that is the greatest good fortune for the world as a whole. When the ruler is clear-sighted and his ministers are honest, that is the good fortune of the state. When fathers are loving and sons filial, husbands trustworthy and wives faithful, that is the good fortune of the family. “Nevertheless, though Bi Gan was loyal, he could not save the Yin dynasty, though Wu Zixu was wise, he could not preserve the state of Wu, and though Prince Shensheng was filial, his country of Jin was beset by disorder. These states all possessed loyal ministers and filial sons, yet they encountered disorder and downfall. Why? Because there was no clear-sighted ruler or worthy father to heed the ministers and sons. Therefore the world heaps censure and shame on the rulers and fathers and pities the ministers and sons. Similarly, Lord Shang, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong carried out their role as ministers correctly, but the rulers they served were at fault. Therefore the world praises these three as men who achieved merit but failed to receive reward. But it surely doesn’t wish to imitate their unfortunate deaths! “If one must die first before he can prove his loyalty or establish his name, then Wei Zi was no model of benevolence, Confucius was unworthy to be called a sage, or Guan Zhong to be called great. When a man sets out to achieve merit, surely he hopes that he will be able to preserve his life at the same time, does he not? If he can preserve both life and name, that is the finest. If he leaves behind a model name but loses his life in the process, that is the next best. But if his name is heaped with censure and shame, while his life continues, that is the lowest of all.” The marquis of Ying indicated his approval.

After a little while, Cai Ze found an occasion to resume, saying, “Lord Shang, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong as ministers exerted utmost loyalty and achieved merit, and in that sense one could wish to be like them. But when Hong Yao served King Wen and the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, surely they too were loyal and sage. From the point of view of the ideal relationship between ruler and minister, who is more worthy to be emulated, Lord Shang, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong, or Hong Yao and the Duke of Zhou?” “Lord Shang, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong of course cannot compare with Hong Yao and the Duke of Zhou,” said the marquis.

Cai Ze said, “And your own ruler — how does he compare to the rulers these men served, Duke Xiao of Qin, King Dao of Chu, or the king of Yue, in terms of kindness and benevolence, in trusting loyalty, in being faithful and generous to old associates, in sticking by the worthy and wise, the men of the Way, or in making it a principle never to betray a meritorious minister?” “I would not know how to answer that,” said the marquis.

Cai Ze said, “The present ruler in his concern for loyal ministers hardly surpasses Duke Xiao of Qin, King Dao of Chu, or the king of Yue. And you — how do you compare with Lord Shang, Wu Qi, or Dafu Zhong in exercising wisdom and ability, in striving for the sake of your ruler to overcome peril, improve government, put down disorder, reinforce the armies, skirt danger and surmount difficulty, broaden the territory and increase grain supplies, enrich the nation and its families and strengthen the ruler, bring honour to the altars of the soil and grain and glory to the ancestral temples, so that no one in the world will dare cheat or defy him, and so that his achievements may be manifest to those ten thousand miles away, and his fame shine so brightly it will be handed down for 1,000 generations?” “I am no match for them,” said the marquis.

Cai Ze said, “The present ruler in his concern for loyal ministers or the way he remembers old associates cannot compare to Duke Xiao, King Dao, or King Goujian of Yue. And in terms of merits and achievements or the trust, intimacy, and favour you enjoy with the ruler you cannot compare to Lord Shang, Wu Qi, or Dafu Zhong. And yet your position is one of great distinction, your emolument generous, and your private wealth surpasses that of those three gentlemen. And if you do not withdraw in time, I fear you may meet up with even worse troubles than they did. For your sake I cannot help feeling alarmed.

“The proverb says, ‘The sun at its height moves on, the moon when it’s full starts to wane. Things when they flourish must decay.’ This is the constant rule of Heaven and earth. To advance and retreat, expand and shrink, changing with the times — this is the constant way of the sage. Therefore, when the state possesses the Way, he takes office, but when the state does not possess the Way, he goes into hiding. The sage says: ‘Flying dragon in the heavens; it is profitable to see the great man.’ ‘Wealth and honour not rightly gained are to me like floating clouds.’ “Now you have settled your scores with old enemies and repaid your debts of kindness. Your wishes are fulfilled. Not to plan for some change would, I venture to say, be unwise of you.

The kingfisher and the snow goose, the rhinoceros and the elephant — it’s not that they don’t live in surroundings far removed from the threat of death. The reason they meet death is that they are beguiled by the bait. Men like Su Qin and Zhi Bo — it’s not that they didn’t have wisdom enough to avoid shame and stay far away from death. The reason they met death is that they were beguiled by greed and profit and did not know when to stop. “Therefore the sage lays down codes of behaviour and regulates desires, observing moderation in what he exacts from the people, employing them only in the proper season and seeing that they have some rest from their labours. Hence his ambitions are never excessive, his actions are not arrogant; he is at all times in accord with the Way and never goes astray. And hence the world acquiesces and never turns against him. “Long ago Duke Huan of Qi nine times called the other feudal lords together, and in one stroke brought order to the world. But at the meeting at Sunflower Hill he showed himself arrogant and boastful in his ambitions, and nine of the feudal states turned against him. King Fuchai of Wu had armies unrivalled by anyone in the world, but in his daring and might he was contemptuous of the other feudal rulers and lorded it over Qi and Jin, and therefore in the end he met death and his kingdom perished. Xia Yu and the grand historian Jiao roared so loud they startled the Three Armies, but both died at the hands of common soldiers. These men all rode on a wave of splendid success and failed to return to the principle of the Way. They suffered because they did not assume a humble and retiring posture or observe restraint and moderation.

“When Lord Shang served Duke Xiao of Qin, he worked to clarify the laws and regulations and cut off evil conduct at the root, seeing to it that those deserving of noble rank were duly rewarded, and those who were guilty were duly punished. He adjusted scales, standardized measures, and made weights uniform. He broke down the barriers in the fields in order to stabilize the livelihood of the people, unify their customs, and encourage them to devote themselves to agriculture and get the greatest benefit from the soil. One family was not to pursue two occupations, but to work the fields and store up produce, and also to practise the arts of war. Hence when the troops were put into action, the territory of the state was extended, and when the troops were at rest, the state enjoyed prosperity. As a result, Qin stood unrivalled in the world, able to overawe the other feudal lords and fulfil the destiny of the state. But after Lord Shang had accomplished all these deeds, in the end he was torn in two by carriages. “The state of Chu measures several thousand square li in area and boasts a million lance bearers. Yet Bai Qi, leading an army of 30,000 or 40,000 engaged Chu in battle and in one battle captured Yan and Ying and put Yiling to the torch. And in a second battle he advanced south and annexed the regions of Shu and Han. In addition, he crossed through Hann and Wei and attacked the powerful state of Zhao, in the north defeating Lord Mafu and massacring his host of 40,000 or more, wiping them all out at Changping, till the blood flowed in rivers and the cries rose up like thunder. Then he pushed on to lay siege to Handan, so that Qin could aspire to the position of emperor. Chu and Zhao were the most powerful states in the world and Qin’s chief enemies. But from this time on both Chu and Zhao bowed down in terror and did not venture to attack Qin — because of Bai Qi’s exertions. In person he conquered over seventy cities, yet after he had accomplished these deeds, in the end he was presented with a sword and ordered to die at Duyou. “Wu Qi set up laws for King Dao of Chu, humbling the authority of the great ministers, dismissing those without ability, doing away with those who were unfit. He abolished posts that were not essential, blocked the road to private appeal, unified the customs in the state of Chu, prohibited visitors from other states, and trained men in agriculture and warfare. In the south he took over Yang and Yue, in the north annexed Chen and Cai, smashing the states allied horizontally, scattering those allied vertically, so that the advocates of such alliances could not even open their mouths. He prohibited cliques in order to encourage the common people and brought stability to the Chu government, so that its armies made the whole world tremble and the other feudal lords bowed before its might. But after he had accomplished all that, at the last he was torn limb from limb. “Dafu Zhong devised deep plans and far-reaching schemes for the king of Yue, rescuing him from peril at Kuaiji, turning destruction into survival, transforming shame into glory. He opened up the grasslands and founded cities, broadened the territory and planted grain, leading men from the four directions, commanding the strength of both high and low. He helped King Goujian, already a wise ruler, to carry out vengeance on his enemy King Fuchai, in the end taking prisoner the ruler of powerful Wu. He enabled Yue to become a hegemon, his accomplishments were manifest and indisputable, and yet at the last King Goujian turned on him and killed him. “These four men were ‘achievers who failed to give ground’, and so misfortune befell them. This is what is called being able to stretch but not to contract, to go but not to return. Fan Li understood this, and so he blithely withdrew from the world and lived many more years under the name of Lord Zhu of Tao.

Haven’t you ever watched a gambler? Sometimes he tries for a big haul, other times he is just out for little winnings. Surely this is the sort of thing that you are familiar with and can understand. “Now you are serving as prime minister of Qin. You lay plans without stirring from your seat, concoct schemes without venturing from the hall of state, yet you can control the other feudal rulers, draw on the benefits of the Three Rivers, and make Yiyang yours. You have closed the Sheep Gut pass, blocked the road to Taihang, and sealed off the routes to Fan and Zhonghang, so that the Six States cannot join in alliance against Qin. You have built plank roads a thousand li , opening up communication with Shu and Han, and all the world stands in fear of Qin. Qin’s desires have been gratified, and your merit could be no greater. But at the moment Qin is merely out for ‘little winnings’, and if you do not take this opportunity to retire, you will end up like Lord Shang, Bai Qi, Wu Qi, and Dafu Zhong. “I have heard it said: ‘He who mirrors himself in water his features may see; he who mirrors himself in men may learn his destiny.’ The Book of Documents says: ‘Where great deeds have been done, one cannot linger long.’ Do you think you can stand up against the misfortune that befell those other four men? “Why not take this opportunity to return the seals of prime minister, make way for some other worthy person by relinquishing your post, and retire to live among the cliffs and contemplate the streams? In integrity you will be hailed as another Bo Yi, and you may continue to be called marquis of Ying, as may your descendants for generation after generation. Which is better, to rival Xu You and Prince Yanling in unselfishness and enjoy the longevity of Prince Qiao and the Master of Red Pine, or to end in disaster? Which fate will you choose? If you are too reluctant to tear yourself away, too hesitant to come to your own decision, you will invariably encounter the same misfortune as those four men. “The Book of Changes says: ‘The lofty dragon has regrets.’ This describes one who knows how to go up but not how to come down, how to stretch but not how to contract, how to go but not how to return. Consider the matter carefully, I beg you!”

“Very well,” said the marquis. “I have heard that when desire knows no stopping, one will lose what he desires, and when possession knows no surfeit, one will lose what he possesses. You, sir, have been kind enough to instruct me. I will respectfully heed your words.” Then he led Cai Ze into the inner apartments and seated him in the place of honour.

After a few days, Fan Ju went to court and spoke to King Zhaoxiang of Qin, saying, “A visitor named Cai Ze has recently arrived from east of the mountains. He is a man of great eloquence, well versed in the affairs of the Three Dynasties, the achievements of the Five Hegemons, and the vicissitudes of the times. He is worthy to be entrusted with the government of the state of Qin. I have seen many men, but none who can match him. I am in no way his equal. That is why I venture to mention him.” King Zhaoxiang summoned Cai Ze to an audience and talked with him. Much pleased, he appointed him a “guest minister”. Fan Ju, the marquis of Ying, thereupon pleaded illness and asked to be allowed to return the seals of prime minister. King Zhaoxiang urged him to remain in office, but Fan Ju insisted that his illness was too grave. Thus in the end he retired from the post of prime minister. King Zhaoxiang, more delighted than ever by Cai Ze’s schemes and proposals, eventually appointed him prime minister, and in the east appropriated the territory of the Zhou royal house.

After Cai Ze had been prime minister for several months, someone spoke evil of him. Fearful of punishment, Cai Ze pleaded illness and returned the seals of prime minister, thereafter being known as Lord Gangcheng. He lived in Qin for over ten years, serving King Zhaoxiang, King Xiaowen, and King Zhuangxiang, and finally the First Emperor. He acted as Qin’s envoy to the state of Yan, and three years later Yan sent its heir apparent, Prince Dan, to be a hostage in Qin.

The Grand Historian remarks: Han Fei Zi says: Long sleeves make a good dancer, much money makes a good merchant. How true are these words! Fan Ju and Cai Ze were what the age calls men of superlative eloquence. But both travelled around expounding their ideas to the feudal lords until their heads were grey without ever meeting with success, not because their schemes were inept, but because the persons they addressed wielded little power. Once these two travellers came to Qin, however, they one after the other received the seals of prime minister and accomplished deeds that are known to all the world. This was no doubt because the backing they had was weak in the former cases and strong in the latter. And yet there is also an element of luck in such situations. There are many men who were as worthy of these two, but who never had an opportunity of fully expounding their ideas — too many, in fact, to finish describing! Nevertheless, if these two men had not met with adversity, they might never have been inspired to such efforts.</div>
