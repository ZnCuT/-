          <h3>文言文</h3>
          <div class="txt">淮南厉王长者,高祖少子也，其母故赵王张敖美人。高祖八年,从东垣过赵,赵王献之美人。厉王母得幸焉，有身。赵王敖弗敢内宫，为筑外宫而舍之。及贯高等谋反柏人事发觉,并逮治王，尽收捕王母兄弟美人，系之河内。厉王母亦系，告吏曰：“得幸上，有身。”吏以闻上，上方怒赵王，未理厉王母。厉王母弟赵兼因辟阳侯言吕后,吕后妒，弗肯白，辟阳侯不强争。及厉王母已生厉王，恚，即自杀。吏奉厉王诣上，上悔，令吕后母之，而葬厉王母真定。真定，厉王母之家在焉，父世县也。

高祖十一年七月,淮南王黥布反,立子长为淮南王,王黥布故地，凡四郡。上自将兵击灭布,厉王遂即位。厉王蚤失母，常附吕后，孝惠、吕后时以故得幸无患害,而常心怨辟阳侯，弗敢发。及孝文帝初即位,淮南王自以为最亲,骄蹇,数不奉法。上以亲故，常宽赦之。三年,入朝。甚横。从上入苑囿猎,与上同车，常谓上“大兄”。厉王有材力,力能扛鼎，乃往请辟阳侯。辟阳侯出见之，即自袖铁椎椎辟阳侯,令从者魏敬刭之。厉王乃驰走阙下,肉袒谢曰：“臣母不当坐赵事，其时辟阳侯力能得之吕后，弗争，罪一也。赵王如意子母无罪，吕后杀之，辟阳侯弗争，罪二也。吕后王诸吕,欲以危刘氏，辟阳侯弗争，罪三也。臣谨为天下诛贼臣辟阳侯，报母之仇，谨伏阙下请罪。”孝文伤其志，为亲故,弗治，赦厉王。当是时，薄太后及太子诸大臣皆惮厉王,厉王以此归国益骄恣，不用汉法四，出入称警跸,称制,自为法令，拟于天子。

六年,令男子但等七十人与棘蒲侯柴武太子奇谋,以華车四十乘反谷口,令人使闽越、匈奴。事觉，治之，使使召淮南王。淮南王至长安。

“丞相臣张仓、典客臣冯敬、行御史大夫事宗正臣逸、廷尉臣贺、备盗贼中尉臣福昧死言:淮南王长废先帝法，不听天子诏，居处无度，为黄屋盖乘舆,出入拟于天子，擅为法令，不用汉法。及所置吏，以其郎中令春为丞相,聚收汉诸侯人及有罪亡者,匿与居,为治家室，赐其财物爵禄田宅,爵或至关内侯,奉以二千石，所不当得,欲以有为。大夫但、士五开章等七十人与棘蒲侯太子奇谋反，欲以危宗庙社稷。使开章阴告长，与谋使闽越及匈奴发其兵。开章之淮南见长，长数与坐语饮食，为家室娶妇，以二千石俸奉之。开章使人告但，已言之王。春使使报但等。吏觉知，使长安尉奇等往捕开章。长匿不予，与故中尉商忌谋，杀以闭口。为棺椁衣衾，葬之肥陵邑，谩吏曰‘不知安在’。又详聚土，树表其上，曰‘开章死，埋此下’。及长身自贼杀无罪者一人；令吏论杀无罪者六人；为亡命弃市罪诈捕命者以除罪;擅罪人，罪人无告劾，系治城旦春以上十四人;赦免罪人,死罪十八人，城旦春以下五十八人；赐人爵关内侯以下九十四人。前日长病，陛下忧苦之，使使者赐书、枣脯。长不欲受赐，不肯见拜使者。南海民处庐江界中者反，淮南吏卒击之。陛下以淮南民贫苦，遣使者赐长帛五千匹，以赐吏卒劳苦者。长不欲受赐，谩言曰‘无劳苦者’。南海王织上书献璧皇帝，忌擅燔其书，不以闻。吏请召治忌，长不遣，谩言曰‘忌病'。春又请长，愿入见，长怒曰‘女欲离我自附汉’。长当弃市，臣请论如法。”

制曰：“朕不忍致法于王,其与列侯二千石议。”

“臣仓、臣敬、臣逸、臣福、臣贺昧死言：臣谨与列侯吏二千石臣婴等四十三人议,皆曰‘长不奉法度，不听天子诏，乃阴聚徒党及谋反者，厚养亡命，欲以有为'。臣等议论如法。”

制曰：“朕不忍致法于王，其赦长死罪，废勿王。”

“臣仓等昧死言：长有大死罪，陛下不忍致法，幸赦，废勿王。臣请处蜀郡严道邛邮,遣其子母从居,县为筑盖家室，皆廪食给薪菜盐豉炊食器席蓐。臣等昧死请，请布告天下。”

制曰：“计食长给肉日五斤,酒二斗。令故美人、才人得幸者十人从居。他可。”

尽诛所与谋者。于是乃遣淮南王，载以辎车,令县以次传。是时袁盎谏上曰:“上素骄淮南王，弗为置严傅相，以故至此。且淮南王为人刚，今暴摧折之，臣恐卒逢雾露病死,陛下为有杀弟之名，奈何!”上曰：“吾特苦之耳，今复之。”县传淮南王者皆不敢发车封。淮南王乃谓侍者曰：“谁谓乃公勇者?吾安能勇!吾以骄故不闻吾过至此。人生一世间，安能邑邑如此!”乃不食死。至雍,雍令发封，以死闻。上哭甚悲，谓袁盎曰：“吾不听公言，卒亡淮南王。”盎曰：“不可奈何，愿陛下自宽。”上曰：“为之奈何?”盎曰：“独斩丞相、御史以谢天下乃可。”上即令丞相、御史逮考诸县传送淮南王不发封馈侍者，皆弃市。乃以列侯葬淮南王于雍，守冢三十户。

孝文八年,上怜淮南王，淮南王有子四人，皆七八岁，乃封子安为阜陵侯,子勃为安阳侯,子赐为阳周侯,子良为东成侯。

孝文十二年,民有作歌歌淮南厉王曰：“一尺布，尚可缝；一斗粟，尚可春。兄弟二人不能相容。”上闻之，乃叹曰：“尧舜放逐骨肉,周公杀管蔡,天下称圣。何者?不以私害公。天下岂以我为贪淮南王地邪?”乃徙城阳王王淮南故地,而追尊谥淮南王为厉王,置园复如诸侯仪。

孝文十六年,徙淮南王喜复故城阳。上怜淮南厉王废法不轨，自使失国蚤死，乃立其三子：阜陵侯安为淮南王，安阳侯勃为衡山王,阳周侯赐为庐江王,皆复得厉王时地，参分之。东城侯良前薨，无后也。

孝景三年,吴楚七国反,吴使者至淮南，淮南王欲发兵应之。其相曰：“大王必欲发兵应吴，臣愿为将。”王乃属相兵。淮南相已将兵，因城守,不听王而为汉;汉亦使曲城侯将兵救淮南:淮南以故得完。吴使者至庐江，庐江王弗应，而往来使越。吴使者至衡山，衡山王坚守无二心。孝景四年,吴楚已破,衡山王朝，上以为贞信，乃劳苦之曰：“南方卑湿。”徙衡山王王济北,所以褒之。及薨,遂赐谥为贞王。庐江王边越，数使使相交，故徙为衡山王，王江北。淮南王如故。

淮南王安为人好读书鼓琴,不喜弋猎狗马驰骋，亦欲以行阴德拊循百姓,流誉天下。时时怨望厉王死，时欲畔逆，未有因也。及建元二年,淮南王入朝。素善武安侯，武安侯时为太尉,乃逆王霸上,与王语曰：“方今上无太子，大王亲高皇帝孙，行仁义，天下莫不闻。即宫车一日晏驾，非大王当谁立者!”淮南王大喜，厚遗武安侯金财物。阴结宾客,拊循百姓,为畔逆事。建元六年,彗星见，淮南王心怪之。或说王曰：“先吴军起时，彗星出长数尺，然尚流血千里。今彗星长竟天，天下兵当大起。”王心以为上无太子，天下有变，诸侯并争，愈益治器械攻战具，积金钱赂遗郡国诸侯游士奇材。诸辨士为方略者，妄作妖言，谄谀王，王喜，多赐金钱，而谋反滋甚。

淮南王有女陵,慧，有口辩。王爱陵，常多予金钱，为中词长安,约结上左右。元朔三年,上赐淮南王几杖,不朝。淮南王王后荼，王爱幸之。王后生太子迁，迁取王皇太后外孙修成君女为妃。王谋为反具，畏太子妃知而内泄事，乃与太子谋，令诈弗爱，三月不同席。王乃详为怒太子,闭太子使与妃同内三月，太子终不近妃。妃求去，王乃上书谢归去之。王后荼、太子迁及女陵得爱幸王，擅国权，侵夺民田宅，妄致系人。

元朔五年,太子学用剑，自以为人莫及，闻郎中雷被巧,乃召与戏。被一再辞让，误中太子。太子怒，被恐。此时有欲从军者辄诣京师,被即愿奋击匈奴。太子迁数恶被于王，王使郎中令斥免,欲以禁后,被遂亡至长安，上书自明。诏下其事廷尉、河南。河南治，逮淮南太子，王、王后计欲无遣太子，遂发兵反，计犹豫，十余日未定。会有诏，即讯太子。当是时，淮南相怒寿春丞留太子逮不遣,劾不敬。王以请相,相弗听。王使人上书告相，事下廷尉治四。踪迹连王,王使人候伺汉公卿，公卿请逮捕治王。王恐事发，太子迁谋曰：“汉使即逮王，王令人衣卫士衣，持戟居庭中，王旁有非是,则刺杀之，臣亦使人刺杀淮南中尉,乃举兵，未晚。”是时上不许公卿请，而遣汉中尉宏即讯验王。王闻汉使来，即如太子谋计。汉中尉至，王视其颜色和，讯王以斥雷被事耳，王自度无何，不发。中尉还，以闻。公卿治者曰：“淮南王安拥阏奋击匈奴者雷被等,废格明诏，当弃市。”诏弗许。公卿废勿王，诏弗许。公卿请削五县，诏削二县。使中尉宏赦淮南王罪，罚以削地。中尉入淮南界，宣言赦王。王初闻汉公卿请诛之，未知得削地，闻汉使来，恐其捕之，乃与太子谋刺之如前计。及中尉至，即贺王，王以故不发。其后自伤曰：“吾行仁义见削，甚耻之。”然淮南王削地之后，其为反谋益甚。诸使道从长安来，为妄妖言，言上无男，汉不治，即喜；即言汉廷治，有男，王怒，以为妄言，非也。

王日夜与左吴等案舆地图,部署兵所从入。王曰：“上无太子,宫车即晏驾，廷臣必征胶东王,不即常山王,诸侯并争，吾可以无备乎!且吾亲高祖孙，行仁义,陛下遇我厚，吾能忍之；万世之后,吾宁能北面臣事竖子乎!”

王坐东宫，召伍被与谋，曰：“将军上。”被怅然曰：“上宽赦大王，王复安得此亡国之语乎!臣闻子胥谏吴王,吴王不用，乃曰‘臣今见麋鹿游姑苏之台也’。今臣亦见宫中生荆棘，露沾衣也。”王怒，系伍被父母,囚之三月。复召曰：“将军许寡人乎?”被曰：“不，直来为大王画耳。臣闻聪者听于无声，明者见于未形，故圣人万举万全。昔文王一动而功显于千世,列为三代,此所谓因天心以动作者也，故海内不期而随。此千岁之可见者。夫百年之秦，近世之吴楚,亦足以喻国家之存亡矣。臣不敢避子胥之诛,愿大王毋为吴王之听。

“昔秦绝圣人之道，杀术士,燔《诗》、《书》,弃礼义，尚诈力，任刑罚，转负海之粟致之西河。当是之时，男子疾耕不足于糟糠，女子纺绩不足于盖形。遣蒙恬筑长城,东西数千里，暴兵露师常数十万，死者不可胜数，僵尸千里，流血顷亩,百姓力竭，欲为乱者十家而五。又使徐福入海求神异物,还为伪辞曰：‘臣见海中大神，言曰：“汝西皇之使邪?”臣答曰：“然。”“汝何求?”曰：“愿请延年益寿药。”神曰：“汝秦王之礼薄，得观而不得取。”即从臣东南至蓬莱山,见芝成宫阙,有使者铜色而龙形，光上照天。于是臣再拜问曰：“宜何资以献?”海神曰：“以令名男子若振女与百工之事,即得之矣。”'秦皇帝大说，遣振男女三千人四，资之五谷种种百工而行四。徐福得平原广泽，止王不来。于是百姓悲痛相思，欲为乱者十家而六。又使尉佗逾五岭攻百越。尉佗知中国劳极，止王不来，使人上书，求女无夫家者三万人，以为士卒衣补。秦皇帝可其万五千人。于是百姓离心瓦解，欲为乱者十家而七。客谓高皇帝曰：‘时可矣。'高皇帝曰：‘待之，圣人当起东南间。’不一年，陈胜、吴广发矣。高皇始于丰沛,一倡天下不期而响应者不可胜数也。此所谓蹈瑕候间，因秦之亡而动者也。百姓愿之，若旱之望雨，故起于行陈之中而立为天子，功高三王,德传无穷。

“今大王见高皇帝得天下之易也，独不观近世之吴楚乎?夫吴王赐号为刘氏祭酒,复不朝,王四郡之众,地方数千里，内铸消铜以为钱,东煮海水以为盐，上取江陵木以为船,一船之载当中国数十两车,国富民众。行珠玉金帛赂诸侯宗室大臣，独窦氏不与。计定谋成，举兵而西。破于大梁,败于狐父,奔走而东，至于丹徒,越人禽之,身死绝祀，为天下笑。夫以吴楚之众不能成功者何?诚逆天道而不知时也。

“方今大王之兵众不能十分吴楚之一，天下安宁有万倍于秦之时，愿大王从臣之计。大王不从臣之计，今见大王事必不成而语先泄也。臣闻微子过故国而悲,于是作《麦秀之歌》,是痛纣之不用王子比干也。故孟子曰‘纣贵为天子，死曾不若匹夫’。是纣先自绝于天下久矣，非死之日而天下去之。今臣亦窃悲大王弃千乘之君,必且赐绝命之书,为群臣先，死于东宫也。”于是王气怨结而不扬，涕满匡而横流，即起，历阶而去。

王有孽子不害，最长，王弗爱，王、王后、太子皆不以为子兄数。不害有子建，材高有气,常怨望太子不省其父;又怨时诸侯皆得分子弟为侯,而淮南独二子，一为太子，建父独不得为侯。建阴结交,欲告败太子，以其父代之。太子知之，数捕系而榜笞建。建具知太子之谋欲杀汉中尉，即使所善寿春庄芷以元朔六年上书于天子曰:“毒药苦于口利于病，忠言逆于耳利于行。今淮南王孙建，材能高，淮南王王后荼、荼子太子迁常疾害建。建父不害无罪，擅数捕系，欲杀之。今建在，可征问，具知淮南阴事。”书闻，上以其事下廷尉，廷尉下河南治。

是时故辟阳侯孙审卿善丞相公孙弘,怨淮南厉王杀其大父，乃深购淮南事于弘,弘乃疑淮南有畔逆计谋，深穷治其狱。河南治建，辞引淮南太子及党与。淮南王患之，欲发,问伍被曰：“汉廷治乱?”伍被曰：“天下治。”王意不说,谓伍被曰：“公何以言天下治也?”被曰：“被窃观朝廷之政，君臣之义，父子之亲，夫妇之别，长幼之序,皆得其理，上之举错遵古之道，风俗纪纲未有所缺也。重装富贾，周流天下，道无不通，故交易之道行。南越宾服,羌棘入献,东瓯入降,广长榆,开朔方,匈奴折翅伤翼，失援不振。虽未及古太平之时，然犹为治也。”王怒，被谢死罪。王又谓被曰：“山东即有兵,汉必使大将军将而制山东,公以为大将军何如人也?”被曰：“被所善者黄义，从大将军击匈奴，还，告被曰：‘大将军遇士大夫有礼，于士卒有恩，众皆乐为之用。骑上下山若蜚，材干绝人。’被以为材能如此，数将习兵，未易当也。及谒者曹梁使长安来，言大将军号令明，当敌勇敢，常为士卒先。休舍，穿井未通，须士卒尽得水，乃敢饮。军罢，卒尽已度河，乃度。皇太后所赐金帛，尽以赐军吏。虽古名将弗过也。”王默然。

淮南王见建已征治，恐国阴事且觉，欲发，被又以为难，乃复问被曰：“公以为吴兴兵是邪非也?”被曰：“以为非也。吴王至富贵也，举事不当，身死丹徒，头足异处，子孙无遗类。臣闻吴王悔之甚。愿王孰虑之，无为吴王之所悔。”王曰：“男子之所死者，一言耳。且吴何知反,汉将一日过成皋者四十余人。今我令楼缓先要成皋之口,周被下颍川兵塞辕辕、伊阙之道,陈定发南阳兵守武关。河南太守独有雒阳耳,何足忧。然此北尚有临晋关、河东、上党与河内、赵国。人言曰‘绝成皋之口，天下不通’。据三川之险,招山东之兵,举事如此，公以为何如?”被曰：“臣见其祸，未见其福也。”

王曰：“左吴、赵贤、朱骄如皆以为有福，什事九成，公独以为有祸无福，何也?”被曰：“大王之群臣近幸素能使众者，皆前系诏狱,余无可用者。”王曰：“陈胜、吴广无立锥之地，千人之聚,起于大泽,奋臂大呼而天下响应，西至于戏而兵百二十万。今吾国虽小，然而胜兵者可得十余万，非直適戍之众,钒凿棘矜也,公何以言有祸无福?”被曰：“往者秦为无道，残贼天下。兴万乘之驾,作阿房之宫，收太半之赋,发闾左之戍,父不宁子，兄不便弟，政苛刑峻，天下熬然若焦,民皆引领而望,倾耳而听,悲号仰天，叩心而怨上，故陈胜大呼，天下响应。当今陛下临制天下，一齐海内，泛爱蒸庶，布德施惠。口虽未言，声疾雷霆，令虽未出，化驰如神,心有所怀,威动万里，下之应上，犹影响也。而大将军材能不特章邯、杨罴也。大王以陈胜、吴广谕之,被以为过矣。”

王曰：“苟如公言，不可徼幸邪?”被曰：“被有愚计。”王曰：“奈何?”被曰：“当今诸侯无异心，百姓无怨气。朔方之郡田地广，水草美，民徙者不足以实其地。臣之愚计，可伪为丞相、御史请书,徙郡国豪桀任侠及有耐罪以上,赦令除其罪,产五十万以上者,皆徙其家属朔方之郡，益发甲卒，急其会日。又伪为左右都司空上林中都官诏狱书,逮诸侯太子幸臣。如此则民怨，诸侯惧，即使辩武随而说之,傥可徼幸什得一乎?”王曰：“此可也。虽然，吾以为不至若此。”

于是王乃令官奴入宫,作皇帝玺，丞相、御史、大将军、军吏、中二千石、都官令、丞印,及旁近郡太守、都尉印，汉使节法冠,欲如伍被计。使人伪得罪而西,事大将军、丞相;一日发兵，使人即刺杀大将军青，而说丞相下之,如发蒙耳。

王欲发国中兵，恐其相、二千石不听。王乃与伍被谋，先杀相、二千石；伪失火宫中，相、二千石救火，至即杀之。计未决，又欲令人衣求盗衣,持羽檄,从东方来，呼曰“南越兵人界”,欲因以发兵。乃使人至庐江、会稽为求盗,未发。王间伍被曰：“吾举兵西乡，诸侯必有应我者；即无应，奈何?”被曰：“南收衡山以击庐江,有寻阳之船,守下雉之城,结九江之浦,绝豫章之口,强弩临江而守，以禁南郡之下，东收江都、会稽,南通劲越,屈强江淮间,犹可得延岁月之寿。”王曰：“善，无以易此。急则走越耳。”

于是廷尉以王孙建辞连淮南王太子迁闻。上遣廷尉监因拜淮南中尉逮捕太子。至淮南，淮南王闻，与太子谋召相、二千石，欲杀而发兵。召相，相至；内史以出为解。中尉曰：“臣受诏使,不得见王。”王念独杀相而内史中尉不来，无益也，即罢相。王犹豫，计未决。太子念所坐者谋刺汉中尉,所与谋者已死，以为口绝，乃谓王曰：“群臣可用者皆前系，今无足与举事者。王以非时发，恐无功，臣愿会逮。”王亦偷欲休,即许太子。太子即自刭，不殊。伍被自诣吏,因告与淮南王谋反，反踪迹具如此”。

吏因捕太子、王后，围王宫,尽求捕王所与谋反宾客在国中者，索得反具以闻。上下公卿治，所连引与淮南王谋反列侯二千石豪杰数千人，皆以罪轻重受诛。衡山王赐，淮南王弟也，当坐收,有司请逮捕衡山王。天子曰：“诸侯各以其国为本，不当相坐。与诸侯王列侯会肄丞相诸侯议。”赵王彭祖、列侯臣让等四十三人议,皆曰：“淮南王安甚大逆无道，谋反明白，当伏诛。”胶西王臣端议曰:“淮南王安废法行邪，怀诈伪心，以乱天下，荧惑百姓，倍畔宗庙，妄作妖言。《春秋》曰‘臣无将，将而诛’。安罪重于将，谋反形已定。臣端所见其书节印图及他逆无道事验明白，当伏其法。而论国吏二百石以上及比者，宗室近幸臣不在法中者，不能相教，当皆免官削爵为士伍，毋得宦为吏；其非吏也赎死金二斤八两。以章臣安之罪,使天下明知臣子之道，毋敢复有邪僻倍畔之意。”丞相弘、廷尉汤等以闻,天子使宗正以符节治王。未至，淮南王安自刭杀。王后荼、太子迁诸所与谋反者皆族。天子以伍被雅辞多引汉之美，欲勿诛。廷尉汤曰：“被首为王画反谋,被罪无赦。”遂诛被。国除为九江郡”。

衡山王赐，王后乘舒生子三人,长男爽为太子，次男孝，次女无采。又姬徐来生子男女四人，美人厥姬生子二人。衡山王、淮南王兄弟相责望礼节,间不相能。衡山王闻淮南王作为畔逆反具，亦心结宾客以应之,恐为所并。

元光六年,衡山王入朝，其谒者卫庆有方术,欲上书事天子，王怒，故劾庆死罪,强榜服之。衡山内史以为非是,却其狱。王使人上书告内史，内史治,言王不直。王又数侵夺人田，坏人冢以为田。有司请逮治衡山王。天子不许，为置吏二百石以上。衡山王以此恚，与奚慈、张广昌谋，求能为兵法候星气者,日夜从容王密谋反事。

王后乘舒死，立徐来为王后。厥姬俱幸。两人相妒，厥姬乃恶王后徐来于太子曰：“徐来使婢蛊道杀太子母。”太子心怨徐来。徐来兄至衡山，太子与饮，以刃刺伤王后兄。王后怨怒，数毁恶太子于王。太子女弟无采，嫁弃归,与奴奸，又与客奸。太子数让无采，无采怒，不与太子通。王后闻之，即善遇无采。无采及中兄孝少失母，附王后，王后以计爱之，与共毁太子，王以故数击笞太子。元朔四年中,人有贼伤王后假母者,王疑太子使人伤之，笞太子。后王病，太子时称病不侍。孝、王后、无采恶太子：“太子实不病，自言病，有喜色。”王大怒，欲废太子，立其弟孝。王后知王决废太子，又欲并废孝。王后有侍者，善舞，王幸之，王后欲令侍者与孝乱以污之，欲并废兄弟而立其子广代太子。太子爽知之，念后数恶己无已时，欲与乱以止其口。王后饮，太子前为寿，因据王后股,求与王后卧。王后怒，以告王。王乃召，欲缚而笞之。太子知王常欲废己立其弟孝，乃谓王曰：“孝与王御者奸，无采与奴奸，王强食,请上书。”即倍王去。王使人止之，莫能禁，乃自驾追捕太子。太子妄恶言,王械系太子宫中。孝日益亲幸。王奇孝材能，乃佩之王印，号曰“将军”,令居外宅，多给金钱，招致宾客。宾客来者，微知淮南、衡山有逆计，日夜从容劝之。王乃使孝客江都人救赫、陈喜作输车镞矢，刻天子玺，将相军吏印。王日夜求壮士如周丘等,数称引吴楚反时计画约束。衡山王非敢效淮南王求即天子位，畏淮南起并其国，以为淮南已西，发兵定江淮之间而有之，望如是。

元朔五年秋,衡山王当朝，过淮南，淮南王乃昆弟语，除前卻,约束反具。衡山王即上书谢病，上赐书不朝。

元朔六年中,衡山王使人上书请废太子爽，立孝为太子。爽闻，即使所善白嬴之长安上书,言孝作车镞矢，与王御者奸，欲以败孝。白嬴至长安，未及上书，吏捕嬴，以淮南事系。王闻爽使白嬴上书，恐言国阴事，即上书反告太子爽所为不道弃市罪事。事下沛郡治。元狩元年冬,有司公卿下沛郡求捕所与淮南谋反者未得，得陈喜于衡山王子孝家。吏劾孝首匿喜。孝以为陈喜雅数与王计谋反,恐其发之，闻律先自告除其罪，又疑太子使白嬴上书发其事，即先自告,告所与谋反者救赫、陈喜等。廷尉治，验，公卿请逮捕衡山王治之。天子曰：“勿捕。”遣中尉安、大行息即问王,王具以情实对。吏皆围王宫而守之。中尉大行还，以闻，公卿请遣宗正、大行与沛郡杂治王。王闻，即自刭杀。孝先自告反，除其罪；坐与王御婢奸，弃市。王后徐来亦坐蛊杀前王后乘舒，及太子爽坐王告不孝，皆弃市。诸与衡山王谋反者皆族。国除为衡山郡。

太史公曰：《诗》之所谓“戎狄是膺，荆舒是惩”,信哉是言也。淮南、衡山亲为骨肉，疆土千里，列为诸侯，不务遵蕃臣职以承辅天子,而专挟邪僻之计，谋为畔逆，仍父子再亡国,各不终其身，为天下笑。此非独王过也，亦其俗薄，臣下渐靡使然也。夫荆楚傈勇轻悍，好作乱，乃自古记之矣。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">淮南厉王刘长，是汉高祖刘邦的小儿子，他的母亲本是张敖后宫的美人。汉高祖八年，刘邦从东垣讨伐韩王信回来经过赵国，赵王派自己的一些美人侍候刘邦。刘长的母亲在这时候受到了刘邦的宠爱，怀了身孕。赵王张敖一看就不敢再把她收回去了，于是为她在外面盖了一所房子让她住。等到贯高等人在柏人谋刺刘邦的事被发觉后，赵王也受到牵连而被逮捕了。与此同时赵王的母亲、兄弟、美人也全被抓了起来，关押在河内郡，刘长的母亲也在其中。这时刘长的母亲就对看守他们的官吏们说：“我曾被皇上亲幸过，现在正怀着皇上的孩子。”官吏们一听赶紧把这件事报告了刘邦，刘邦当时正恨赵王，所以没有理会刘长的母亲。刘长母亲的兄弟赵兼就通过辟阳侯审食其转告了吕后，而吕后出于嫉妒，不肯帮忙说情，审食其也没有为此积极活动。因而使得刘长的母亲在生下刘长之后，就恼怒地自杀了。看守的官吏们抱着刘长去见刘邦，刘邦这时也很后悔，于是就让吕后抚养他，而把他的母亲葬在了真定。真定是刘长母亲的老家，他的父祖世代住在那里。

高祖十一年七月，淮南王黥布谋反了，于是刘邦就立即宣布改立他的小儿子刘长为淮南王，把原先封给黥布的一共四个郡的地盘都封给了他。接着刘邦就亲自率领部队前往消灭了黥布，而刘长也就随之即位当了淮南王。刘长因为从小没有母亲，是跟着吕后长大的，也正因此他在孝惠帝、吕太后当政的时候，没有像刘邦的其他儿子一样遭到祸害，但是他的心里一直怨恨着辟阳侯审食其，只是没敢发作而已。等到孝文帝一即位，刘长自以为他是皇帝的亲弟弟，于是就开始骄纵起来，经常不遵守法制。文帝看在亲兄弟的份上也总是宽饶他。文帝三年，刘长进京朝见，态度非常骄横。他常常跟着文帝到上林苑一道打猎，和文帝同坐一辆车，向文帝叫“大哥”。刘长很有力气，能把大鼎举起来。有一天他去拜见辟阳侯审食其。审食其出来迎他，一见面刘长就抡起藏在衣袖里的铁锤把审食其打死了，接着又让随从魏敬割下了审食其的脑袋。事后刘长自己骑马跑到皇宫前，脱去上衣向文帝请罪说：“当初我的母亲不应当受赵国逆谋的牵连，当时审食其是有能力说服吕后救我母亲的，可是他不尽力，这是他的头一条罪状。赵王如意和他的母亲也都没有罪，结果都被吕后杀了，审食其当时也没劝阻，这是他的第二条罪状。吕后大封吕姓的子侄为王，目的是想危害刘家的江山，而审食其也不劝阻，这是他的第三条罪状。我现在既为国家除了害，又为母亲报了仇，现在我在这里敬候皇帝的处分。”孝文帝一方面觉得他的用心可怜，同时又是亲骨肉，所以就没有惩罚他，把他赦免了。这时候，上自薄太后、皇太子，下至朝廷诸臣都害怕刘长，而从此刘长回国后也就变得越来越骄傲自大、越不服从朝廷的法令了。他出入宫廷也像皇帝一样地宣布清道戒严，他下的命令也像皇帝一样称为“制”,他在淮南国自己制定了一套法令，他的一切行为都和皇帝一模一样。

文帝六年，刘长让一个名字叫但的人会同了七十多人，和棘蒲侯柴武的太子柴奇一起策划，准备带着四十辆马车，到谷口去造反，同时又派人到闽越和匈奴去进行联络。结果消息泄露，被朝廷立案审查了。文帝派使者叫刘长进京，刘长到了长安。

“丞相张苍、典客冯敬、执行御史大夫职责的宗正逸、廷尉贺、备盗贼中尉福冒死上奏：淮南王刘长不遵守先帝制定的法度，不听从天子的命令，在起居住行方面超出了应有的限度，他竟敢乘皇帝的黄盖车，出游时的排场像皇帝一样，他在淮南实行他自己制定的法令，不使用朝廷规定的王法。他自己随意安置官吏，以至于让他的郎中春做了丞相，他大肆招纳朝廷直辖地区和各个诸侯的人等以及各种逃亡的罪犯，他窝藏他们，并给这些人治产业娶妻室，赏赐给他们财物官爵以及田地房屋，有的竟达到了关内侯，享受了二千石的俸禄，这些都不是他应该做的，他的这些行为都是别有用心。他的大夫但、士兵开章等七十人跟棘蒲侯的太子柴奇互相勾结阴谋造反，企图颠覆汉朝江山。他们派开章把这些阴谋暗中通知刘长，他们计划请闽越和匈奴发兵援助。开章到淮南后，刘长多次与他一道谈话吃饭，为他安家娶妻，让他享受着二千石的俸禄。而后开章派人告诉但，说他已经同淮南王联系好了。这时刘长的郎中春也派密使通知了但等人。可是他们的阴谋活动这时被朝廷的人觉察了，于是朝廷派长安尉奇等人前往淮南捉拿开章。这时刘长先是把开章藏了起来拒不交出，接着刘长为了灭口，又和他的中尉荫忌一起密谋，把开章杀掉了。他们为开章置备了棺椁衣衾，把他的尸体埋在肥陵邑。他们欺骗奉命往捕开章的官吏，说他们‘不知道开章在什么地方’。后来他们又堆了一个假坟头树起一块牌子，写着‘开章埋在这下面'。除此之外刘长还亲手杀死过一个无罪的人；他还命令他的官吏们强加罪名杀死过六个无罪的人；更有甚者他们为了包庇畏罪逃亡的人而捉拿了一些无罪的人来冒名充数；他随便给人定罪，而且还不许人家告状。被他逮捕判了筑城春米等苦役以上罪刑的有十四人；相反他凭空赦免了死刑犯十八人，筑城舂米等苦役犯以下的五十八人；受他赏赐当了关内侯以下的总计九十四人。前些时候刘长生病，陛下为他担心，派人给他送去慰问信、赐给他枣脯，可是刘长居然不想接受皇帝的赏赐，不想接见使者。当住在庐江县的一些南海人闹暴乱，刘长派人前去镇压时，陛下考虑到淮南地区的苦难，派人送给刘长布帛五千匹，让他把这些东西发给那些在平定暴乱中出过力的人。可是刘长居然不肯接受，并说‘没有什么出过力的人’。南海王织给皇帝上书献璧，而刘长的中尉荫忌居然敢擅自中途焚毁了南海王的奏章，不向皇帝上交。当时朝廷有人请求召商忌进京审问，但刘长抗命不派，撒谎说‘商忌病了'。当时他的郎中春向他请求，说他愿意进京朝见，刘长发怒说‘你想背离我去归附朝廷吗'!总之，凭着刘长的这些罪行，理应斩首示众，我们请求依法处置。”

皇帝批示说：“我不忍心依法惩治他，请你们同列侯、二千石们再重新议论一下。”

“臣苍、敬、逸、福、贺冒死进言：我们同列侯、二千石臣婴等四十三人又慎重地议论了刘长的罪行，大家都说‘刘长不遵守国家法度，不听从天子的命令，竟然暗中聚集党徒和阴谋造反的人，他给那些亡命徒以优厚的待遇，想要借着他们闹大乱子'。因此我们坚决要求对他依法处治。”

皇帝又批示说：“我实在不忍心把法律施行到他的头上，现在既然你们这样坚持，那就赦免了他的死罪，只废除他的王位吧。”

“臣张苍等冒死向皇帝进言：刘长犯了死罪，皇帝不忍心将他处死，准备赦免他，只是废去他的王爵。我们请求把他流放到蜀郡严道县的邛邮去，让他的妻子儿女们也都跟着他一道去，让当地的县里给他们盖房子，并供给他们一应的粮食、柴禾、蔬菜、油盐、炊具、床席等生活用品。这是我们的请求，请皇上布告天下，一体周知。”

文帝批示说：“可以每天供给刘长五斤肉，两斗酒，并让他所亲幸的十个美人、才人跟着他一道去。其他事情都依然照你们说的办。”

于是朝廷下令就把其他那些参与谋反的人全都处决了，而后打发刘长上路去蜀郡。他们让刘长坐进一辆上有帷罩的车子，让沿途各县依次负责向蜀郡传递。这时袁盎劝阻文帝说：“您一向宠爱淮南王，没有给他任命严厉的太傅和丞相来加以管教，所以才闹成了今天这个样子。淮南王为人刚强，如今骤然这样地打击他，我怕他万一要是得个病死了，那您还不落一个杀害弟弟的恶名吗，那将怎么好呢?”文帝说：“我不过是让他一时吃点苦罢了，我马上要让他回来的。”谁料想沿途传送淮南王的那些县官们谁也不敢打开淮南王车子上的封条叫淮南王出来见天日。刘长气愤地对他周围的人们说：“谁说老子是好汉?我要真是好汉能像今天这个样子吗?我就是因为过去太骄傲了，听不到自己的过错，所以才落得如此下场。人活在世上，怎么能够总是这么憋憋闷闷地过日子!”于是就绝食饿死了。待至到了雍县，雍县县令一打开封条才发现刘长已死，于是他们赶紧向文帝报告。文帝哭得很伤心，他对袁盎说：“我当初没听您的话，果然把淮南王给弄死了。”袁盎说：“现在反正也没有办法了，只有请您想开些。”文帝说：“还有什么补救没有呢?”袁盎说：“只有杀掉丞相、御史，用他们的人头来向天下人谢罪。”文帝不同意，他只是让丞相、御史去调查发送淮南王的各县县官，把那些不给淮南王开封、进食，不好好侍候淮南王的人全都杀掉了。然后又以列侯的身份把刘长安葬在了雍县，并安置了三十户人家给他守坟。

孝文帝八年，皇上忽然又可怜起淮南王来，当时淮南王有四个儿子，都是七八岁。于是文帝就封刘安为阜陵侯，刘勃为安阳侯，刘赐为阳周侯，刘良为东城侯。

孝文帝十二年，民间忽然流传起了一首有关淮南王的民谣，意思说：“一尺布，尚可缝；一斗粟，尚可春，兄弟二人不能相容。”文帝听说后，叹息道：“尧放其子丹朱，舜放其弟象，周公杀掉了自己的弟弟管叔、蔡叔，天下人仍称他们是圣人贤君。为什么呢?就因为他们能够不以私情妨害公利。现在人们给我编歌唱，莫非他们以为我是贪图淮南王的地盘吗?”于是他就下令调城阳王刘喜去淮南的故地称王，同时追谥刘长为淮南厉王，并按照诸侯王的礼仪给他修建了坟墓。

孝文帝十六年，皇上又下令让刘喜重新回到了城阳。文帝可怜刘长因为不守法纪、行为不轨，以致国破身亡，于是又封了他的三个儿子：封阜陵侯刘安为淮南王，封安阳侯刘勃为衡山王，封阳周侯刘赐为庐江王，都是在刘长旧时的地盘上，把一个国家分成了三份。这时东城侯刘良已经死了，而且没有后代，所以就没有封。

孝景帝三年，吴楚七国造反了。当吴国的使者来到淮南时，淮南王刘安也打算起兵响应。这时淮南国的丞相说：“如果您一定想要起兵，我愿意给您当将军。”淮南王一听就把兵权交给了丞相。淮南丞相一旦取得兵权后，就立刻下令固守城池，不再听刘安的指挥而听从朝廷的命令；这时朝廷也派了曲城侯虫捷率领部队来救助淮南，因此淮南得以完好无损。吴国的使者到了庐江后，庐江王不答应，而与越国保持着紧密联系。吴国的使者到了衡山，衡山王更是坚守城池毫无二心。孝景四年，吴楚之乱平定，衡山王进京朝见时，景帝表扬了他的忠贞守信，对他慰劳说：“你那里的地面太低洼潮湿了。”为了奖励他，便就把他的封地换到了济北。到刘勃死时，朝廷又特别给他赐谥为“贞王”。庐江和越国接壤，两国的使者不断往来，朝廷对此不高兴，于是把庐江王刘赐改封为衡山王，把他迁到了长江以北。而淮南王刘安则还和从前一样。

淮南王刘安喜欢读书弹琴，不喜欢骑马射猎，同时也想在底下做些好事以讨好百姓，给自己造点名声。他对父亲刘长被朝廷所害耿耿于怀，总是想着造反，只是没有找到机会。武帝建元二年，刘安进京朝见。刘安一向与武安侯田蚡交好，田蚡当时正做太尉，他到霸上迎接刘安的时候，对刘安说：“现在皇上还没有太子，您是高祖皇帝的亲孙子，又能施行仁义，天下的人没有不知道的。如果有朝一日当今的皇上驾崩，那时除了立您还能立谁呢!”刘安听了很高兴，送给了田蚡很多东西。自己回去后也暗中结交宾客，并进一步地收买拉拢人心，为阴谋叛乱作准备。武帝建元六年，天上出现了彗星，刘安心里感到奇怪。这时有人对刘安说：“当年吴楚起兵时，天空出现的彗星才不过几尺长，结果就发生了战争，以至流血千里。今天的彗星横过整个天空，只怕整个天下都要发生战乱了。”刘安心想皇上现在还没有太子，一旦天下出现了变乱，各国诸侯都会出来争夺天下的，于是就更加积极地准备兵甲器械等进攻作战的物资，并收罗钱财广为招纳收买各郡国的游说之士和奇特人才。而那些有智略有口才的人们也就趁着机会，编造妖言，向他讨好。刘安听着高兴，也就更多地赏给他们金钱，从而谋反的心思也就越来越厉害了。

刘安有个女儿叫刘陵，天资聪明，口才又好。刘安很喜爱她，经常给她许多钱，派她到长安去侦探情况，结交了一些武帝身边的人。武帝元朔三年，武帝赐给刘安一个小几，一条手杖，允许他可以不必进京朝见皇上，以表示对这位长辈的尊敬。刘安的王后叫做荼，刘安很喜欢她。这位王后生了一个太子叫刘迁，刘迁娶了武帝的母亲王太后的外孙、修成君的女儿为妃。刘安害怕自己策划谋反的事情被他儿子的这个妃子知道泄露出去，于是就和刘迁商量，让刘迁假装不喜爱他的妃子，三个月都不与她同房。而刘安又假装对刘迁的这种做法很生气，把刘迁和他的妃子推到一间屋子里关了三个月，而刘迁始终还是不靠近她。妃子无法只好自己请求回娘家了，这时刘安也假惺惺地上书向修成君表示歉意，把这个妃子送了回去。刘安的王后茶以及刘安的儿子刘迁和女儿刘陵由于都受到刘安的特别宠爱，所以他们就在淮南专权跋扈，随意霸占老百姓的房屋，随便打人抓人，到处胡作非为。

武帝元朔五年，太子刘迁学习剑术，自以为没人比得了，他听说郎中雷被剑法高明，就召来与他比试。雷被一再推辞，太子不答应，最后在比试时雷被误伤了太子。太子大为恼怒，雷被也恐惧万分。当时国家有种规定，凡是愿意当兵的就可以自行到长安去。雷被说他愿意去当兵打匈奴。而这时太子刘迁已经多次在刘安面前说了雷被的坏话，于是刘安就让郎中令免了雷被的职，想要借此以挟制别人。结果雷被逃跑了，他逃到了长安，向武帝上书讲了自己的遭遇。于是武帝就把这件事交给了廷尉与河南郡去共同调查处理。河南郡开始办案了，办事人要求刘迁前去听审，刘安和他的王后不愿叫刘迁去，准备发兵谋反。但他们又犹豫不决，十几天定不下来。这时朝廷又下了诏书，派了官员到淮南国来就地讯问太子。在此以前，淮南的丞相就对寿春县丞不及时强制太子上路不满，已经向皇帝弹劾寿春县丞的不遵诏命、对皇帝不敬。刘安为此向自己的丞相说情，丞相不答应。于是刘安又派人给皇帝上书告发自己的丞相。皇帝又把此案交给了廷尉处理。结果在审问调查中渐渐地就牵连到了刘安头上。刘安派人到长安去探听大臣们的态度，而朝廷里的公卿大臣们已经提出要求逮捕刘安。刘安害怕谋反的事情败露，这时太子刘迁给刘安献计说：“朝廷如果派人来逮您，您就派亲信穿着卫士的衣服，拿着长戟站在院子里。如果您身边一有什么活动，您就先杀死他，而我也立刻派人去杀死淮南国的中尉，那时我们再发兵造反，也不算晚。”其实，当时在朝廷里武帝并没同意公卿们的请求，而只是派了中尉殷宏到淮南国来向刘安当面查讯。刘安听说朝廷派人来了，立刻就按照刘迁的计划做了部署。中尉殷宏来到后，刘安见他和颜悦色，只是问了他为什么斥逐雷被的事情，刘安估计不会有什么大问题，于是就没有发作。殷宏回朝后，把情况向武帝作了汇报，参与办理此事的公卿们都说：“淮南王压制阻挠了自愿去抗击匈奴的雷被等人，这是公然对抗朝廷的诏令，罪当处死。”武帝不同意。公卿们又请求废除刘安的王爵，武帝也不答应。公卿们又请求削去淮南国五个县，最后武帝只是同意削了两个。而后又派中尉殷宏去宣布赦免刘安的罪过，只是给他个削地的处分。殷宏一进入淮南地界，就把赦免刘安的消息传出去了。刘安那里开始听说朝里的公卿们请求杀他，还不知道最后只是定了个削地，所以他们一听说汉朝的使者到来，就害怕要被逮捕，就和刘迁一道准备着要按上次计划的那个办法办。等到殷宏一到，一看原来是向刘安祝贺的，因此刘安也就不动手了。但事后他又伤心地说：“我是施行仁义的，不想被削夺了领地，真是莫大的耻辱。”从此他就越来越积极地准备谋反了。凡是出使长安回来的人，如果谁编造谣言，说皇上没有儿子，朝廷政治一片混乱，他就高兴；如果谁要说朝廷的政治不错，皇帝有了儿子，他就非常生气，认为这是瞎说，是不真实的。

刘安日日夜夜地与左吴等人对着地图策划，部署军队从什么地方进攻。刘安说：“皇上没有太子，一旦驾崩之后，朝廷大臣们一定会让胶东王或者常山王入朝即位，那时诸侯就起来互相争夺，我能够不预先作好准备吗!况且我是高皇帝的亲孙子，我又能施行仁义，是因为当今的皇上待我不错，所以我才暂时忍着。等到当今的皇上死后，我还能够向那些别的小子们北面称臣吗!"

有一天刘安坐在东宫，派人把伍被叫来商量事情，他用皇帝的口气对伍被说：“将军到跟前来。”伍被一听不高兴地说：“皇上刚刚宽赦您，您怎么又说这种自我亡国的话呢!我听说当年伍子胥就曾规劝过吴王夫差，夫差不听忠告，伍子胥就说‘我仿佛已经看到鹿群在变成废墟的姑苏台上奔跑了'。现在我也仿佛看到咱淮南的宫殿中长满了荆棘，而荒草上的露水已经沾湿游人的衣服了。”刘安大怒，立刻把伍被连同他的父母都关押了起来。过了三个月后，他又把伍被叫来问他说：“你愿意和我一道干了吗?”伍被说：“我只是想来替您出出主意。俗话说耳朵好的人能听到没有发出的声音，眼睛好的人能看到没有成形的事物，所以大圣人做事总是做一万件成一万件。当初周文王一举事，他的功勋就被万古流传了，他建立的周王朝被列为‘三代'之一，这就是通常所说的顺着天意采取行动。所以天下人事先并没有约定，而到时候就自然地跟着他去了。这是千年以前有目共睹的事情。再说百年以前的秦朝，和几十年以前的吴、楚七国，这些国家的教训也足以使人从中看到我们日后的兴盛或衰亡。我不怕像伍子胥那样被夫差所杀，但我希望您不要像夫差那样拒绝伍子胥的忠告。

“当初秦始皇灭绝了圣人的仁义之道，坑杀儒生，焚烧《诗》、《书》,废弃礼义，崇尚暴力诡诈，任用严刑峻法，把东部沿海的粮食都搜刮转运到关中去。在那时候，男人拼命地耕种仍填不饱肚子，女人拼命地织布仍衣不蔽体。而秦始皇还派蒙恬去修筑长城，长城从东到西几千里，害得几十万军民不分寒暑，顶风冒雨地在那里干，死的人尸横千里，血流遍地，无法计算。百姓们精疲力尽，哭告无门，想要造反的十家里头就得有五家。秦始皇为了追求长生不死还派了徐福去海上寻找神仙，访求灵药。徐福回来编造说：‘我见到了海中的大神，海神问我：“你是西方皇帝派来的使者吗?”我说：“是的。”海神说：“你来干什么?”我说：“想寻找延年益寿的灵药。”海神说：“你们秦王让你带来的礼物太少了，只能让你看看，不能让你拿走。”于是他就领着我往东南走，来到了蓬莱山。我在那里看到了灵芝长成的宫殿，那里有一个铜色、形状像龙的使者，他的身上放着光芒，上彻霄汉。于是我就向海神叩问说：“应该带什么礼物来敬献呢?”海神说：“带一批良家出生的童男、童女和一些擅长各种手艺的工匠来就行了。”秦始皇一听非常高兴，随即选出了童男少女三千人，并让他们带上五谷杂粮种子和各种工匠而后出发了。结果徐福出去后领着这些人找了一个土地平坦水草丰茂的地方，就在那里自己称王，不再回来了。这件事又害得百姓们万分痛苦，思念亲人，以至于想要造反的十家里头就有六家了。后来秦始皇又派尉佗翻越五岭去进攻百越，尉佗知道当时的国家已经疲惫到了极点，于是也就领着人马留在那里称王，不再回来了。而且还派人上书，要求秦朝给他派遣没有出嫁的女子三万人，名义上是去帮助他们的士兵们缝补衣服，而秦始皇居然答应给他派去了一万五千人。这一来百姓们更加离心离德想造反的十家里头就有七家了。当时就有人已经对咱们高祖说：‘时机到了。’高祖说：‘再等一等，圣人应当从东南方起事。'不到一年，陈胜、吴广果然发难了。接着咱们高祖也从丰沛起兵。结果振臂一呼不用事先约定，光是立刻响应的就数也数不清了。这就叫做善于寻找机会，顺着他即将灭亡的趋势来采取行动，百姓们个个拥护，就像大旱的岁月里盼望大雨那么急切，于是咱们高祖从一个平民出身，就这么当了皇帝了。他的功业盖过了三王，他的仁德将永远传于后世。

“今天您只看到了高祖取得天下的容易，为什么不再看看吴、楚七国叛乱的下场呢?吴王刘濞被称为刘氏的祭酒，还特别准许他不用进京朝拜，他管辖着四个郡的民众，地盘纵横几千里，他在国内开采铜矿铸造钱币，又在东海边上煮水为盐，他采伐江陵的树木建造船只，一条船装载的东西可以抵得上北方的几十辆车子，因而他国又富人又多。他拿出大量珠宝金帛来贿赂收买各国的诸侯和朝廷里的宗室大臣，最后只剩了窦氏一族没有进入他们的网络。这时刘濞认为一切策划都已妥贴，于是就出兵西进。谁想很快地败于大梁，再败于狐父，刘濞奔走东逃，在他跑到丹徒的时候被越人活捉，最后身死国灭，落得让天下人耻笑。刘濞有这么多的人马而不能成功，这是为什么呢?就因为他们背逆天道而不识时务。

“现在大王您的兵力民众还赶不上吴、楚七国的十分之一，而现时国家的稳定又远远超过秦朝一万倍，所以我希望您还是依着我的主意。如果您不依着我的主意，我怕您等不到大事成功您的计划就先泄露出去了。过去微子在经过自己昔日的国都时曾作过《麦秀之歌》,表达了他对殷纣王不重用王子比干的痛恨。孟子所说的‘殷纣王活着虽贵为天子，而到死的时候却连个普通人也不如’,这是因为殷纣王早就自绝于天下人了，而不是到他死的时候人们才离弃他。今天我也暗自为您舍弃千乘之君图谋造反而悲哀。我担心有朝一日您必将接到朝廷赐您自尽的命令，让您比所有淮南大臣更早地自尽于东宫。”刘安一听心里十分窝火，他眼睛里滚动着泪珠站起身来，快步上殿而去。

刘安有个庶出的儿子叫刘不害，在他的儿子里头年龄最大，但是刘安不喜欢他。刘安、刘安的王后，以及刘安的太子都不把他当作儿子、哥哥看。刘不害有个儿子叫刘建，这个人有才干有志气，经常怨恨太子瞧不起他父亲。又怨恨当时别的诸侯王都已经分割土地封自己所有的儿子都当了侯，唯独淮南王的两个儿子，除了其中的太子可以继承父业外，而自己的父亲刘不害竟没有被封为侯。于是刘建就暗中结交了一帮人，想要告发搞垮太子，让他的父亲刘不害取而代之。太子知道了这件事，多次把刘建抓起来审问拷打。刘建知道太子打算谋杀汉朝中尉的阴谋，于是就派了他的亲信寿春人庄芷以他个人的名义于武帝元朔六年给武帝上书说：“良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行。如今淮南王的孙子刘建很有才干，而淮南王的王后荼和她的儿子太子刘迁却总是忌恨他。刘建的父亲刘不害本来无罪，却被他们多次擅自逮捕关押，想杀害他。现在刘建就在那里，朝廷可以找他来问，他对淮南国那些见不得人的事情全都知道。”武帝看了奏书，就让廷尉处理这事。廷尉又把这件事转给了河南郡。

这时候老辟阳侯审食其的孙子审卿和丞相公孙弘关系好，审卿怨恨老淮南王刘长当年杀了他的祖父，于是就在公孙弘面前大量地说淮南王的坏话，于是公孙弘开始怀疑刘安有反叛朝廷的阴谋，因而他也决心把这个案子搞清楚。河南郡一审问刘建，刘建很快地就把淮南太子和他的党羽们牵连了出来。刘安这时也怕了，于是想要起兵造反。他问伍被说；“现在国家的局势怎么样?”伍被说：“天下很安定。”刘安听着不高兴，又说：“你根据什么说天下很安定呢?”伍被说：“我是看着朝廷现时的政治，看着整个国家里的君臣、父子、夫妇、长幼各方面的关系都有条不紊。现在皇上的一举一动都遵循古来的道德，社会上的风俗法纪都没有什么缺憾。那些财货雄厚的富商大贾，可以周游天下，条条道路无不畅通，各地的货物可以很好地得到交流。南越已经归顺了朝廷，羌人焚人也都前来进贡了，东瓯已经投降，国家的领土扩展到了长榆，新的朔方郡已经设立，匈奴人就像一只大鸟折断了翅膀，孤立无援，再也飞不起来了。现在的国家虽然还达不到上古的太平盛世，但说它安定还是完全可以的。”刘安很生气，伍被一看，只好连忙谢罪。刘安又对伍被说：“崤山以东如果有人造反，朝廷必定会派大将军卫青前去弹压，你认为卫青是个什么样的人呢?”伍被说：“我有个朋友叫黄义，曾跟随卫青去打过匈奴。他回来后对我说：‘大将军待人很有礼貌，对待士兵很有恩德，大家都乐于为他效力。他骑着马上山下山就像飞一样，才干实在是超群出众。’我认为凭着这样的才干，又曾经多次统兵出征，熟习军事，这样的人不是容易对付的。后来谒者曹梁出使长安归来，说大将军号令严明，遇到敌人十分勇猛，经常身先士卒。驻扎下来的时候，水井没有打好，他总是等着士兵们都喝到水后，他才喝水。军队回来的时候非等士兵们都过了黄河，他才过河。皇太后赏给他的金银绸缎，他都拿出来赏给军中的吏卒。即使古代的名将也不能超过他。”刘安听了，默默无言。

刘安见孙子刘建被传去审讯了，害怕自己阴谋造反的事被发觉，于是想马上起兵。这时伍被又出来劝阻，刘安又问伍被说：“你认为当年吴国起兵是对还是错呢?”伍被说：“我认为是错的。吴王当时已经富到极点，还要起兵造反，结果事情不成在丹徒被杀，自己头足分家，子孙全部灭绝。我听说吴王临死时非常悔恨。希望您好好考虑，不要将来也像吴王那样后悔。”刘安说：“男子汉有时就是为了一句话而不顾死活。再说吴王根本不懂得怎么造反。当时朝廷出兵，光是通过成皋的一天就有四十多位将领。现在我命令楼缓先夺取成皋要塞，让周被率领颍川的军队控制辗辕、伊阙的通道，让陈定调发南阳的队伍夺取武关。这样一来朝廷的河南太守就只剩下一个孤立无援的洛阳了，那还有什么可忧虑的呢?尽管北面还有临晋关、河东、上党以及河内、赵国等地区。但正如人们所说：‘只要堵住了成皋，整个天下就无法通连。'到那时我们再凭借着三川的险要形势，招纳东都地区的兵马，我们照着这样的方略办事，你认为怎么样?”伍被说：“我光看到了灾难看不出有什么吉祥。”

刘安说：“左吴、赵贤、朱骄如都认为这么做不错，事情会十拿九稳，唯独你认为只有灾难没有吉祥，这是为什么?”伍被说：“您那些亲近大臣中平素得人心的，在此之前已经都被逮捕起来了，剩下来的没有什么可用的人。”刘安说：“当初陈胜、吴广连个立锥之地都没有，结果领着千数人在大泽乡振臂一呼，天下人都纷纷响应，等到西进打到戏亭时，队伍就达到了一百二十万。现在我的淮南虽小，国内能够拿起武器的就有十多万，而我这些人又绝不像当初陈涉的人那样，只是一些囚徒，手里也只是拿着镰刀斧子锄柄木棍而已，你怎么说我有祸无福呢?”伍被说：“当初是因为秦朝暴虐无道，残杀天下的人民。他征调了上万辆的车子，来修筑阿房宫，他们把百姓们每年收获粮食的一大半都搜刮起来，他们把里巷左边的居民都统统拉去守边疆，弄得父亲照顾不了儿子，哥哥不能帮助弟弟，而且国家的法令酷苛，整个国家的百姓们都像被热锅烤焦了，百姓们伸着脖子四处张望，竖起耳朵仔细谛听，他们哭天号地，捶胸顿足地骂秦王朝，所以当陈胜揭竿而起振臂一呼时，天下人立刻就都纷纷起来响应了。而今天的形势是，万岁爷统治着天下，而整个国家是团结统一的，皇上爱护着他的黎民百姓，他的仁德恩惠普施到了每一个人。因此皇帝即使不讲话他的声音也会像雷霆一样地传布四方；他即使不下令，百姓们接受他的感化也会像神明一样的迅速，他的心里一有什么想法，他的威严立刻就会震动到万里之外，百姓们对待皇上的号召，就像影子随形、回响应声一样的麻利。而当今大将军卫青的才能又远远不是秦朝的将领章邯、杨熊等所可比拟的。因此您老拿陈胜、吴广的事情拿来打比喻，我认为是不合适的。”

刘安说：“如果照你这么说，那我们就不可能取得胜利了?”伍被说：“我倒是还有个主意。”刘安说；“什么主意?”伍被说：“现在其他各国的诸侯们对朝廷都没有二心，百姓们对国家也没有什么怨气。不过我想国家新设置了朔方郡，那里土地广阔，水草丰茂，过去虽然也向那里移去了一些士民，但还远远不够。我想我们可以假造一份丞相御史给皇帝的奏书，这份奏书请求征调全国各郡、各诸侯国一切有侠客色彩的人，和犯有剃毛发以上罪行的人，以及家有产业价值五十万钱以上的人，都让他们全家迁到朔方去住。可以多调一些军队负责押送，而且把期限弄得急一点。此外，我们再假造一些左右都司空、上林中都官和诏狱的逮捕令，声言要大肆逮捕诸侯太子们的宠臣。这样一来就会招起百姓们的怨恨和诸侯们的恐惧，而后我们再派出一些伶牙俐齿的说客去鼓动他们，这样也许还侥幸有个十分之一的希望。”刘安说：“这个主意很好，但是我觉得用不着像你搞得这么复杂。”

于是刘安便把一些官奴叫到宫中，叫他们在那里制造皇帝的王玺，和丞相、御史、大将、军官、中二千石、都官令、丞等各种职务的印章。同时也模仿着刻制了一些淮南临近的各郡太守、都尉的印章，私造了一些朝廷使者戴的帽子和执持的旌节，准备按伍被的主意办。又派人假装得罪了刘安而逃到京城的大将军和丞相的府中去做事，目的是等到淮南一发兵，他们就刺杀大将军卫青，而劝说丞相投降刘安。他认为这样一来一切就会像揭开盖布一样的容易了。

刘安想发动国内的军队起事，又害怕他的丞相、二千石们不听他的指挥。于是他和伍被商量，准备先把他的丞相、二千石等杀死。他们计划假借宫中失火，骗丞相、二千石们前来抢救，这样他们一到，立即把他们干掉。这个计划还没有最后决定，他又想派人假装穿着“求盗”小吏的衣服，拿着告急的文书，从南方跑来，大呼“南越兵攻入国界了”,以便使他们趁这个机会发兵造反。刘安这时已经派人到庐江、会稽去假装“求盗”这个角色了，只是还没有回来。刘安问伍被说：“我一旦出兵西进，诸侯们一定会有人响应我；但是如果没有人响应我，那可怎么办呢?”伍被说：“先往南收编衡山国的军队，而后攻击庐江，夺取寻阳的战船，控制住下雉县城；再占据九江口，切断豫章北来的通路；再派强弓硬弩把住长江，截住南郡一带的军队不让他们沿江而下；而后我们往东夺取江都、会稽，往南与越国联合，这样我们就可以在江淮之间称霸一方.就可以坚持一个时期了。”刘安说：“对.没有比这个主意更好的了。如果再有什么危险我们就逃到南边的越国去。”

这时廷尉已经把淮南王的孙子刘建供词中牵扯出淮南王太子刘迁的事情向武帝作了报告。武帝一听立即派了廷尉监联合淮南中尉共同逮捕刘迁。他们到了淮南，刘安听说后，立即和太子商量，准备把朝廷委派到淮南来的丞相、二千石们叫来，杀掉他们而后起兵。他们叫丞相，丞相来了，而内史则以有事需要外出为由，没有前来。中尉则说：“我听从朝廷的命令，不能去见您。”刘安一看心想只杀了丞相而不杀内史和中尉，也没有用处，便把丞相也放了。刘安这时仍很犹豫，拿不定主意。太子心想，自己的罪名只不过是想要谋害朝廷派来的中尉，而和自己一起设谋的人现在已经死了，绝了口供，无法对证，于是就对刘安说：“我们的大臣里头中用的都被抓起来了，剩下的没有谁可以和我们一起干事。如果您起事的时机不合适，也难以成功，现在我愿意让朝廷把我抓去。”刘安这时心里也想能住手就住手，于是就答应了刘迁。而刘迁下来随即自杀了，但还没有咽气，这时伍被出去自首了，他把刘安谋反的事情，原原本本地都托了出来。

于是主管的官吏们立即逮捕了刘迁和刘安的王后，并把刘安的王宫包围了起来。他们把尚在淮南的那些曾参与谋反的人们全部抓了起来，并搜出了谋反的确实证据，报告了武帝。武帝把问题交给公卿们进一步审理，结果又牵连出了与刘安谋反有关的各地的列侯、二千石、豪杰几千人，朝廷根据他们的罪行都给予了相应的惩处。衡山王刘赐是刘安的弟弟，也应该连坐被捕，主管人员请求逮捕他。武帝说：“诸侯们各人管自己的国家，不应当互相连坐。这件事情你们和丞相、诸侯王们再议论一下。”随后赵王刘彭祖、列侯曹襄等四十三人议论过都说：“淮南王刘安大逆不道，谋反的罪行清楚明白，应当将他处死。”胶西王刘端说：“淮南王刘安不遵循朝廷法令，专门做坏事，心怀欺诈，制造混乱，蛊惑人心，背叛祖宗，制造妖言。《春秋》上说‘做臣子不能招兵聚众，谁招兵聚众就杀了谁’。刘安的罪行超过招兵聚众，他分明是想要造反。我看了他的那些书信、符节、印章以及其他种种大逆不道的证据，都很确凿，实在是无法容忍，应当依法处死。淮南国中的那些二百石以上和相当二百石的官吏，以及宗室成员、亲近幸臣等即使没有参与谋反，也应该定一个平时不能教导劝谕的罪，都应当免官削爵为平民，今后不许再做官。对于那些不是官吏的，就罚他们每人出黄金二斤八两以赎死罪。要借着宣布刘安的这次犯罪，让整个国家的人都知道应该怎样做臣子，叫他们今后不敢再生造反的念头。”丞相公孙弘、廷尉张汤等人把讨论的结果报告了武帝，武帝派了宗正手持符节去审问刘安。他们还没有到达，刘安就闻讯自杀了。王后茶、太子刘迁和其他参与谋反的人都被灭族。武帝认为伍被在和刘安的反复对答中说过许多朝廷的好话，辞令优雅，想不杀他。这时廷尉张汤说：“伍被首先为淮南王出谋反的主意，罪行绝不能宽饶。”于是伍被也被杀掉了。淮南国的建置被撤消，在那里设立了九江郡。

衡山王刘赐，他的王后乘舒生了三个子女，大儿子刘爽，已被立为太子，二儿子刘孝，老三是个女儿叫刘无采。另一个姬妾徐来生了子女四个，另一个美人厥姬生了两个儿子。刘赐与刘安兄弟两个彼此指责对方礼数不周，时而闹些矛盾，刘赐听说刘安积极活动准备造反，也想结交宾客准备到时响应，但他担心自己的国家被刘安吞并。

元光六年，轮到衡山王进京朝拜，这时他的一个谒者卫庆由于懂得方术，便想上书请求去侍奉天子。刘赐生气，故意地给卫庆强加死罪，严刑拷打逼迫他承认。这时衡山国的内史认为有问题，拒绝给卫庆定罪。于是刘赐又指使人上书告发内史，内史被审讯时，坚持说刘赐没有道理。还连带说出了刘赐多次霸占民田，毁坏人家坟墓的事情。于是朝廷里的有关人员便请求皇帝逮捕刘赐。皇帝没有批准，只是取消了他自行设置二百石以上官吏的权利。刘赐从此很生气，他和奚慈、张广昌等密谋，让他们去寻访来一些能够用兵布阵和会观测天文星象的人，这些人到一起后就日夜地阴谋策划、积极地怂恿着刘赐造反。

不久，刘赐的王后乘舒死了，徐来被立为王后，而同时厥姬也很受宠幸，两人相互妒嫉。于是厥姬就在太子面前诬陷徐来，说太子的母亲是被徐来指使人用巫蛊害死的。太子听了心里痛恨徐来。有一天，徐来的哥哥来到衡山，太子趁着与他一道饮酒的机会，用刀刺伤了他。徐来心恨太子，于是就不断地在刘赐面前说太子的坏话。太子的妹妹无采，嫁了人被人家休了回来，在家里先是与奴仆通奸，又和门客通奸。太子多次责备她，无采很生气，从此不再和太子相往来。王后知道了这件事，就特别厚待无采。无采和她的二哥刘孝从小就没有母亲，一向依附王后徐来，现在徐来再故意地表示对他们的亲爱，于是他们就联成一气共同诋毁太子，以至于使太子多次被他的父亲刘赐所痛打。元朔四年中，有人刺伤了徐来的乳母，刘赐怀疑是太子指使人干的，于是不问青红皂白又把太子打了一顿。后来刘赐病了，太子有时装病，不去侍候。这时刘孝、徐来、无采三人联合起来在刘赐面前诬陷太子说：“太子根本没有病，当他说自己有病时，他的脸上还很高兴哪。”刘赐一听大怒，于是想废掉太子，改立他的弟弟刘孝。当徐来得知刘赐已经决心要废刘爽时，心里也想把刘孝一齐废掉。这时她身边有个侍女，擅长舞蹈，曾受过刘赐的宠幸，徐来想让她去勾引刘孝，借此把刘孝搞臭。以达到让他们兄弟二人一齐被废，另立她所生的儿子刘广为太子的目的。太子刘爽知道徐来的这种阴谋，但他想到徐来老是这么没完没了地说自己的坏话，也不是办法，于是就想借着和她通奸来堵住她的嘴。有一天徐来正在饮酒，刘爽就借着上前给她敬酒的机会，趁势坐在了徐来的大腿上，要求和徐来睡觉。徐来大怒，把情况报告了刘赐。刘赐一听，立刻派人把刘爽叫来想要捆绑起来打他。刘爽知道刘赐早就想废掉自己另立弟弟刘孝，于是就在刘赐面前反击他们说：“刘孝和您喜欢过的侍女通奸，无采同她的家奴通奸。您就好好地注意保养自己吧，我要给朝廷上书，告发他们。”说罢掉头扬长而去。刘赐叫人拦住他，但谁也没有拦住。于是刘赐就亲自乘车追上去逮捕了他。刘爽则破口大骂诸人，刘赐无奈只好给他戴上枷锁关在了宫中。刘孝则从此受到宠幸。刘赐特别赏识刘孝的才能，让他佩带王印，号称将军，让他居住在宫外，给了他大量钱财，让他去招揽宾客。那些到衡山来的人们，也都暗中知道刘安、刘赐有造反的打算，于是也就跟着日夜不停地劝着他们造反。刘赐打发刘孝招来的江都的救赫和陈喜去打造战车和弓弩，去刻制天子用的玉玺，将军丞相以及各种军吏使用的印章。刘赐还不分白天黑夜地把周丘等壮士找来，给他们讲一些吴、楚七国造反时的行动计划，要他们遵照执行。其实刘赐倒不是也像刘安那样想做皇帝，他只是担心他的衡山国被刘安所吞并。他是希望在刘安率兵西取长安时，他自己出兵把江淮一带的地方据为己有，希望就是这样。

元朔五年秋天，刘赐应该进京朝拜，当他路过淮南的时候，刘安和他以亲兄弟的身分进行了友好的谈话，消除了以前的隔阂，订立了一道造反的盟约。这样一来，刘赐就给皇帝上书，推说有病，而皇帝也就批准了他不进京的请求。

元朔六年，刘赐派人上书请求废掉刘爽另立刘孝为太子。刘爽得知这个消息后，立刻派了他的亲信白赢到长安上书，准备揭发刘孝制造战车、弓箭以及他和刘赐的侍女通奸的事情，想借此以击败刘孝。白赢到了长安，还没来得及上书，就因为他与淮南王造反的事有牵连而被狱吏逮捕了。刘赐听说刘爽已经派白赢去长安上书，他害怕衡山国内的阴谋被揭发，于是就上书反告太子刘爽大逆不孝应该杀头。皇帝把这件事情交给了沛郡审理。元狩元年冬天，有关公卿让沛郡到衡山国去搜捕参与淮南王刘安谋反的人而没有抓获，但却在刘赐的儿子刘孝家中抓到了被刘爽告发的陈喜。于是主管官吏就起诉刘孝窝藏陈喜。刘孝这时也怕这个一向与刘赐密谋造反的陈喜，把他们都供出来，同时他也听说按法律规定先自首的人可以免罪，他还怀疑太子刘爽早已经派白赢上书告发了他们，于是刘孝去投案自首了，他揭发了和刘赐一起阴谋造反的救赫、陈喜等人。廷尉审查清楚后，公卿们请求逮捕刘赐依法治罪。皇帝批示说：“不要逮捕他。”于是就派了中尉司马安、大行李息前往衡山找刘赐询问，刘赐无法，只好如实地作了交待。于是官吏们就把刘赐的王宫包围把守了起来。司马安、李息回到了长安，向皇帝作了报告，于是公卿们请求皇帝派宗正、大行与沛郡太守协同审理刘赐。刘赐听到这个消息，立刻引颈自杀了。刘孝由于是先投案自首的，所以免除了他的谋反罪；但他还有与其父的侍女通奸的问题，所以被斩首示众了。刘赐的王后徐来因为有利用巫蛊谋害前王后乘舒的罪行，太子刘爽因为被其父告为不孝，也一起被斩首示众。而其他参与刘赐谋反的人就都被族灭了。从此衡山国被废除，另设为衡山郡。

太史公说：《诗经》上所说的“对戎狄只有打，对荆舒只有驱逐”,这话的确讲得不错呀。淮南、衡山两个国家的君主都是天子的亲骨肉，受封的疆土宽广，位在诸侯之列，可是他们居然不遵守藩臣的职责，不辅佐朝廷，而是一门心思为非作歹，策划叛乱，所以使得父子两代两次亡国，都不得善终，为天下人所耻笑。这件事情不光是国王的错误，也是由于当地的风俗不好，臣子们逐渐地影响他们，从而使他们变成这样的。荆楚一带的人勇猛剽悍，喜好闹事，这些是自古以来就有记载的。</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Liu Chang, Prince Li of Huainan, was one of Emperor Gaozu's younger sons. His mother had been a court lady of Zhang Ao, the former prince of Zhao. In the eighth year of his reign, when Emperor Gaozu went from Dongyuan to Zhao, the prince of Zhao presented her to him. She was favoured by the emperor and conceived. The prince of Zhao did not dare to keep her in his palace, but built another palace for her. When Guan Gao and others plotted treason at Boren and were discovered,the prince of Zhao was also seized and tried, while his mother, brothers and court ladies, including Liu Chang's mother, were imprisoned at Henei. She told the officers that she was carrying the emperor's child, but when they reported this Emperor Gaozu was so enraged with the prince of Zhao that he ignored the matter. Her brother Zhao Jian sent word by the marquis of Piyang to Empress Lü, but the jealous empress would not speak up for her and the marquis did not insist. As soon as Iiu Chang was born,his mother killed herself in anger. The officers took the child to the emperor, who filled with remorse, ordered Empress Lü to rear it and had the mother buried in Zhending where her family had lived for generations.

In the tenth month of the eleventh year of Emperor Gaozu, Ying Bu the prince of Huainan rebelled, and Liu Chang was made prince in his place to rule the four provinces which had belonged to him. His rule began after Emperor Gaozu led troops in person to wipe out the rebels. Since Liu Chang had lost his mother and was close to Empress Lü, he was favoured and came to no harm during the reigns of Emperor Hui and Empress Lü. Resentment rankled in his heart against the marquis of Piyang, but he dared not disclose his feelings. When Emperor Wen first came to the throne, the prince of Huainan behaved in a proud, overbearing manner because he was next of kin, often breaking the law. But since they were brothers the emperor pardoned him. In the third year he came to court and conducted himself in the most presumptuous manner. Hunting with the emperor in the imperial park, he rode in the same carriage and addressed him as “Elder Brother”. The prince was a powerful man, strong enough to lift a bronze cauldron. He went to call on the marquis of Piyang and,when the latter came out to see him, struck him with an iron hammer which he had concealed in his sleeve, then ordered his follower Wei Jing to cut off his head. The prince then rode to court and, baring his left arm, apologized. "My mother was not involved in Zhao's conspiracy, and the matquis of Piyang could have interceded successfully for her with the empress, but he let the matter slide. That was his first crime. Prince Ruyi of Zhao and his mother were innocent, but Empress Lü had them killed and the marquis did nothing to save them. That was his second crime. When Empress Lü endangered the imperial house of Liu by making her kinsmen princes, the marquis did not protest. That was his third crime. Now I have killed this traitor for the state and avenged my mother. I bow before the court and beg to be punished.” Because he had his reasons and they were brothers, the emperor pardoned him. At this time Empress Bo, the crown prince and all the chief ministers went in fear of the prince of Huainan. After his return to his principality he grew even more high-handed. He ignored the laws of the land, usurped the imperial prerogatives when he entered or left the palace, and issued his own decrees, all as if he were the emperor.

In the sixth year, he sent Dan and seventy other men to plot rebel- lion with Qi, the son of Chai Wu, the marquis of Jipu. They drove in forty large carriages to Gukou.Envoys were also sent to approach the tribes of Minyue and the Huns. The plot was discovered and investigated, and the prince was summoned to the capital.

The prime minister Zhang Cang, the master of ceremony Feng Jing, the clan officer and acting chief counsellor Yi, the chief justice He, and Fu the metropolitan commander in charge of suppressing rebels, presented this memorial to the throne: Liu Chang, the prince of Huainan, has broken the laws of the late emperor and disobeyed Your Majesty's orders. His whole way of life is completely unrestrained, for he has adopted a yellow canopy and imperial equipage and goes about as if he were the emperor. He has issued his own decrees, ignoring the laws of the land, and has outstepped his station by appointing his palace guard Chun as prime minister. He has gathered together men from the various fiefs of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.) as well as fugitives from justice, and is giving them shelter,supplying them with houses, granting them money, goods, ranks, salaries and landed property, even enfeoffing some of them as marquises with a two thousand piculs stipend. He has done all these wrong things with a definite purpose. His minister Dan with seventy others including Kai Zhang, a retired officer, plotted rebellion with Qi, heir of the marquis of Jipu, to endanger our state. Kai Zhang was sent in secret to report this to the prince of Huainan, that he might join in the conspiracy and send envoys to the Minyue tribes and the Huns to enlist their support. When Kai Zhang reached Huainan, the prince granted him several audiences, feasted him and gave him a house, a wife and a salary of two thousand piculs. Then Kai Zhang sent to tell Dan that he had spoken to the prince. And prime minister Chun dispatched messengers to Dan and the others. The authorities, discovering this plot, sent Qi the military tribune of Chang'an and others to arrest Kai Zhang. But the prince concealed him and would not hand him over. He arranged with his former military tribune Jian Ji to murder Kai Zhang in order to stop him from talking. A coffin and grave clothes were supplied and the corpse was buried at Feiling, while the prince denied all knowledge of Kai Zhang's whereabouts. Then, to trick the authorities, he made a grave mound bearing the inscription: Here Kai Zhang is buried. Liu Chang has also killed an innocent man, ordered his officers to condemn six others to death, and arrested men to take the place of fugitives from justice who deserved death, letting those felons go free. He has condemned men without the court's permission,s entencing fourteen men to hard labour and other punishments. He has pardoned criminals, including eighteen who deserved death and fifty-eight who had been sentenced to hard labour, pounding rice and other punishments. He has bestowed titles up to the rank of a marquis on ninety-four men. Not long ago when Liu Chang was ill,Your Majesty in concern sent an envoy to him with a letter and some preserved jujubes. But Liu Chang refused the gift and would not receive the envoy. When the officers and men of Huainan quelled the revolt of the people of Nanhai who had been moved to Lujiang, Your Majesty out of compassion for their poverty sent an envoy to the prince with five thousand rolls of silk to recompense the officers and men for their exertions. But again Liu Chang refused the gift and lied, "No one here has suffered any hardships.” When Wang Zhi of Nanhai sent a jade disc and a letter to the emperor, Jian Ji the metropolitan tribune burned the letter and did not report the matter. The authorities asked for Jian Ji to put him on trial, but the prince would not hand him over, making out that he was ill When his prime minister Chun asked permission to come to court, the prince stormed at him, "Do you want to leave me and go over to Han?”Liu Chang should be executed in the market-place. We beg that this be done according to the law.

The emperor decreed, "We cannot bear to punish the prince ac- cording to the law. Discuss the matter further with the feudallords and ministers of the two thousand piculs rank.”

They presented another memorial: Your subjects Cang, Jin, Yi, Fu and He, make this report at the risk of death. We have discussed the matter with the feudal lords and minsters of the two thousand piculs rank, including Marquis Xiahou Ying and others, forty-three in all. They agree that the prince of Huainan has broken the law and disobeyed Your Majesty's orders. He has secretly gathered followers and conspirators, he has used his wealth to keep fugitives from justice and to plot treason.We recommend that he be punished according to the law.

The emperor decreed,"We cannot bear to punish the prince according to the law.Let him be spared the death penalty but deprived of his rank as a prince.”

Then the ministers replied: Your subjects Cang and the others make this report at the risk of death. The prince of Huainan deserves the death penalty, but unwilling to enforce the rigour of the law Your Majesty has pardoned him, depriving him only of his rank as a prince. We suggest that he be exiled to Qiong Station in Yandao in the province of Shu,accompanied by his children and their mothers. The district authorities can build him a house and supply him with food, providing him with firewood, vegetables, salted beans, cooking utensils, mats and bedding. Deserving death for our presumption, we beg that this be announced throughout the empire!

The emperor decreed," Regarding food for Liu Chang, let him be given five catties of meat a day and two measures of wine. Let ten ladies who have won his favour also join him. For the rest, it shall be as you propose. Let all the conspirators be executed.”

Then the prince of Huainan was sent off in a covered carriage, and the district authorities were ordered to pass him on from one station to another. Yuan Ang remonstrated with the emperor, saying," Your Majesty has always spoilt the prince of Huainan, not appointing strict tutors and ministers for him. That is how this came about. Moreover, the prince is proud and stubborn. Now that you have suddenly crushed him, I am afraid he may die on this difficult journey. What if you are accused of fratricide?” "I am doing this to teach him a lesson," replied the emperor. “I shall soon reinstate him.” The district authorities through whose hands the prince passed were too afraid to open up the sealed carriage. "Who calls me a brave fellow?" the prince of Huainan asked his attendants, "What courage can I show now? I n my pride, I never realized the extent of my fault. What man could bear to live on wretchedly like this?” He refused all food and died. When his carriage reached Yong, the local magistrate broke open the seals and reported the prince's death. The emperor wept bitterly. "By ignoring your advice I have lost the prince of Huainan," he told Yuan Ang. "It cannot be helped now" replied Yuan Ang." Your Majesty must not take it too much to heart." "What should I do now?" asked the emperor. The only way to propitiate the empire is to execute the prime minister and chiefcounsellor.” But the emperor ordered the prime minister and chief counsellor to punish all the local officials along the way who had failed to open the prince's carriage or supply him with food and attendants, and all of them were publicly executed. The prince of Huainan was buried at Yong with the funeral rites of a marquis, and thirty households were appointed to take charge of his tomb.

In the eighth year of his reign Emperor Wen, stilgrieving over the prince of Huainan, ennobled his four sons who were all about seven or eight years old at that time.Liu An was enfeoffed as marquis of Fuling,Liu Bo as marquis of Anyang, Liu Ci as marquis of Yangzhou, and Liu Iiang as marquis of Dongcheng.

In the twelfth year of Emperor Wen,the people made up this song about the prince of Huainan: A single foot of cloth can be sewn, A single peck of millet hulled; But an elder and younger brother Can never abide each other. The emperor sighed when he heard this and said," When Yao and Shun exiled their own flesh and blood and the duke of Zhou killed Guan and the whole world called them sages. For they would not let private sentiment interfere with the public good. Does the world really believe that I coveted the land of the prince of Huainan?” He made the prince of Chengyang take over the former kingdom of Huainan and gave the prince of Huainan the posthumous title of Li, laying out a Walled garden round his tomb as befitted a prince.

In the sixteenth year, Emperor Wen moved the new prince of Huainan back to be prince ofChengyang. Still grieved because Prince Li had lost his kingdom and met an untimely death on account of his lawless and unprincipled behaviour, the emperor divided the old territory of Huainan into three parts and made Liu Chang's son An,the marquis of Fuling, prince of Huainan; Bo, the marquis of Anyang, prince of Hengshan; and Ci, the marquis of Yangzhou, prince of Lujiang. Liang, the marquis of Dongcheng, had died leaving no heir.

In the third year of Emperor Jing, the princes of Wu, Chu and five other kingdoms rebelled. The prince of Wu sent an envoy to the prince of Huainan and the latter wanted to send troops to join them. His chief minister said," If you mean to raise an army to aid Wu, let me serve as commander." But when the prince gave him command of the army he defended the city, ignoring the prince's orders, and remained loyal to Han. The emperor also sent the marquis of Qucheng with troops to save Huainan. Thus it was kept out of the war. When the prince of Wu's envoy reached Lujiang, the prince of Lujiang did not join the rebels but remained in touch with the Yue tribesmen. When the prince of Wusenvoy reached Hengshan, the prince of Hengshan remained steadfast and loyal too. In the fourth year of Emperor Jing, after the defeat of Wu and Chu, the prince of Hengshan came to court and the emperor commended his loyalty." The south is low and swampy," he declared. "Let the prince of Hengshan rule over Jibei instead." When the prince died he was given the posthumous title of Zhen. Since the prince of Lujiang's territory bordered on that of Yue and he had often exchanged envoys with the tribesmen, he was moved to Hengshan north of the Yangtse River. The prince of Huainan retained his former territory.

Liu An, prince of Huainan, was fond of reading and playing the lyre, but took no pleasure in hunting with hounds and horses. He tried to win the people by acts of kindness so that his fame might spread throughall the land. Long embittered by the death of his father, Prince Li, he intended to revolt at the first opportunity. In the second year of the reign period Jianyuan, the prince of Huainan went to pay homage at court.An old friend of his, the marquis of Wuan, who was then the grand marshal,came to meet him at Bashang and told him, "Now the emperor has no heir. Your Highness is the grandson of Emperor Gaozu, and your deeds of kindness and justice are known to all. Should the emperor die, who would be a more fitting successor?” The prince in high delight gave the marquis of Wuan rich gifts and gold. In secret he set about gathering followers and winning the hearts of the people in preparation for a revolt. In the sixth year of Jianyuan a comet appeared. The prince thought it a strange omen and someone told him, “At the start of the prince of Wu's rebellion, a comet only a few feet long appeared, yet blood flowed for a thousand b. This comet has filled the whole sky.It must portend fierce fighting in the empire." The prince believed that as the emperor had no heir there would be trouble and the princes would contend for supremacy. So he got weapons and laid up a store of money to win over the other princes, wandering scholars and men of outstanding ability. Then orators and strategists made wild, fantastic predictions to please the prince who showered gold on them in his delight, and plotted rebellion even more eagerly.

The prince had a daughter, Ling, an intelligent girl who had a ready tongue.She was his favourite and he kept her well supplied with money to act as his spy in the capital and get on good terms with the emperor's attendants. In the third year of Yuanshuo the emperor gave the prince of Huainan a stool and walking-stick and exempted him from paying homage at court. The prince was much attached to his consort Tu, the mother of the crown prince Qian, who had married Lord Xiucheng's daughter, a grand-daughter of Empress Dowager Wang. Fearing lest the crown prince's wife learn of his plot and disclose it, the prince secretly instructed his son to treat her coldly and refuse to sit on the same mat with her for three months. Then the prince, pretending to be angry with his son, confined him in the same room as his wife for three months, but still Qian never went near her. At that she asked to leave him, and the prince of Huainan sent her back with a letter of apology to the emperor. Queen Tu, the crown prince Qian and Princess Ling were favoured by the prince of Huainan. They wielded absolute power within the principality, seizing land and houses from the people or ar- resting men at will.

The crown prince Qian had studied swordsmanship and fancied himself unsurpassed in all the land. In the fifth year of Yuanshuo, having heard that the palace guardsman Lei Bei was a good swordsman, he summoned him to a contest. Lei Bei repeatedly refused to strike but then by accident wounded the prince, who was so angry that Lei Bei feared reprisals. At this time anyone who asked to join the army was sent straight to the capital, so Lei Bei volunteered to go and fight the Huns. But the crown prince had spoken ill of him to the prince, who ordered the chief of the palace guards to dismiss Lei Bei from his post as a warning to others. Then Lei Bei fled to Chang'an and reported the matter. The emperor ordered an investigation by the chief justice and the governor of Henan, who sent to arrest the Crown prince. The prince of Huainan and his consort were tempted not to hand Qian over but to raise a revolt. They hesitated for more than ten days, however, and could not make up their mind. Meanwhile there came another decree ordering Qian's trial on the spot. By now the chief minister of Huainan, angry with the local chief justice for holding back the order for the crown prince's arrest, charged him with insubordination and insisted on sending in this charge despite the prince of Huainan's protests. Then the prince sent someone to court to inform against the minister. The matter was investigated by the chief justice, and the prince of Huainan was found to be involved. Some of his men who were spying on high government officials learned that they had asked for his arrest and trial, and he was afraid that his whole plot would come out. The crown prince said," When the envoy of Han comes to arrest you, sir, post halberdiers dressed as bodyguards in the court. In the event of trouble, they can kill the envoy while I send men to kill the government's military tribune of Huainan. It will not be too late then to rise in arms." The emperor did not agree to his ministers' proposal, however, but sent the tribune Hong to question the prince and verify the facts. When the prince of Huainan heard that the court envoy had come, he did as his son had suggested. But so mild and affable did the tribune prove, simply asking how Lei Bei had come to be dismissed, that the prince assumed he had no cause for alarm and did not carry out his plan. The tribune returned to make his report, and the ministers in charge of the case said," Liu An the prince of Huainan detained Lei Bei and others who had volunteered to go and fight the Huns. For defying a government decree, he deserves public execution." To this the emperor would not agree, and when the ministers asked that the prince be deposed, the emperor again refused his consent. Then they suggested that Liu An be deprived of five counties. The emperor deprived the prince of two counties and sent Hong to inform him that his offence was pardoned but that some of his land was to be confiscated. The tribune crossed the border into Huainan to announce the pardon. The prince, who knew that the ministers had proposed his execution but not that he would simply be deprived of some territory, feared that the government envoy was coming to arrest him. He there- fore plotted with his son, as before, to kill the envoy. When the tribune arrived, however, he congratulated the king on his pardon, and so the king did not carry out his plan. Later he regretted this and said, "I act with humanity and justice and yet am deprived of territory.How shameful" After this he stepped up his plans for revolt. If his envoys came back from the capital with wild rumours and declared that the emperor had no son or the country was badly governed, the prince exulted. If anyone said the country was well governed or a son had been born to the emperor, he raged and considered these as vicious lies.

Day and night the prince, Wu Bei, Zuo Wu and others pored over maps and discussed where to station troops for the attack on Han. "The emperor has no heir," said the prince." When he dies, the ministers at court will summon the prince of Jiaodong or the prince of Changshan. Then all the princes will contend for the throne. I must be prepared. I am Emperor Gaozu's grandson, known for my kindness and justice. Since His Majesty has treated me well, I can bide my time. But after his death you need not expect me to swear allegiance to some silly boy.”

One day, sitting in his East Palace, the prince summoned Wu Bei to consult him. “Come here, general!” he cried. "The emperor has pardoned Your Highness," said Wu Bei gravely. “Why should you still plot to overthrow the state? I have heard that after Wu Zixu's advice was ignored by the king of Wu, he said, I foresee the day when wild deer will roam the terraces of Gusu.' And I can foresee the day when brambles will grow over your palace and the dew will wet men's clothes." In a rage the prince had him and his parents imprisoned for three months, at the end of which time he summoned him again. "Do you agree with me now, general?" he asked. "No?" said Wu Bei." But let me offer Your Highness some advice. I have heard that a man with good ears can hear what has not yet made a sound, a man with good eyes can see what has not yet taken form. That is why a sage succeeds in all he does. King Wen of old made but one move, yet he has been honoured for a thousand generations as the founder of one of the three great dynasties. For he carried out the will of Heaven and all men followed him of their own accord. This is a case from a thousand years ago, whereas the Qin Dynasty of a hundred years ago and Wu and Chu in recent times are examples of how kingdoms fall. I am not afraid to share the fate of Wu Zixu, but I hope Your Highness will not listen to wrong advice like the king of Wu.

“Qin abandoned the ways of the former kings, killed scholars, burnt the ancient songs and documents, gave up ceremony and justice, advocated treachery and force, relied on punishments and shipped grain from the coast to Xihe. In those days, although men wore themselves out in the fields, they had not even enough chaff or husks to eat. Although women wove and spun, they had not clothes enough to cover themselves. The emperor sent Meng Tian to build the Great Wall ex- tending thousands of li from east to west. He kept hundreds of thou- sands of troops deployed in the field, and the dead were past counting. Corpses lay strewn for a thousand li, hundreds of mu flowed with blood, and the people were so exhausted that five households out of ten longed to revolt. "Then Xu Fu was sent out to sea in search of supernatural beings, and on his return he lied to the emperor, saying, I have seen the great god of the ocean,who asked whether I was the envoy from the Emperor of the West. When I signified that I was, he asked me my business. I told him I was looking for an elixir to prolong life. He replied that since the king of Qin's gifts were so poor, I could see what I wished but might take nothing away. Then he let me go southeast to Mount Penglai, where I saw palaces built of sacred fungus. There was a god the colour of bronze and shaped like a dragon, whose light blazed up to illuminate the sky. I bowed and asked what presents I should bring, and the god replied that the elixir could be had by anyone who brought young boys and girls and crafts of every kind.' "The First Emperor of Qin in high delight sent him back with three thousand boys and girls, the five types of grain and a hundred different craftsmen. But when Xu Fu reached a plain with a broad expanse of water, he set himself up as king there and never returned. Then the people grieved over their bitter loss, and six households out of ten longed to revolt. “Then the emperor dispatched Wei Tuo south across the mountains to attack the Yue tribes. Knowing that the people were at the end of their tether, Wei Tuo set himself up as king there and did not go back but sent to ask for thirty thousand unmarried women to mend his troops' uniforms and the emperor sent him fifteen thousand women. That was when the people became further demoralized and seven house- holds out of ten wanted to revolt. "Someone advised Emperor Gaozu, Now is the time!?But he answered, "Wait. Wise men are going to rise in the southeast. Before a year had passed, Chen She and Wu Guang started their revolt, and when Emperor Gaozu issued a call from Feng and Pei countless multitudes throughout the land responded spontaneously. That was a case of waiting for the right occasion and striking as Qin was about to fall, when the people longed for its overthrow as men in time of drought long for rain. Thus he rose from the ranks to become the emperor, his achievement surpassed that of the three sage kings and his virtuous influence will be handed down for ever.

"Now Your Highness has seen how easily Emperor Gaozu won his empire. But consider the case of Wu and Chu in recent times. The prince of Wu was entitled the chief of the imperial clan and did not have to go to court to pay homage. He ruled the multitudes of four provinces with a territory of several thousand square li. He minted money from copper and boiled sea water on the east coast to extract salt. To the west he felled timber at Jiangling to make boats, each able to carry as much as several dozen waggons of the central states. His land was wealthy and populous and he sent jewels, gold and silk to bribe the princes, members of the imperial clan and high ministers. All but the Dou family were in his plot. “After his preparations were complete, he led his army westward. Defeated at Daliang and routed at Hufu, he fled eastward to Dantu where he was captured by the Yue tribesmen. So he perished and his clan was wiped out, becoming the world's laughing-stock.The reason why he failed despite the size of his forces was that he flouted Heaven's law and did not choose the right time.

"Now your troops are less than one-tenth of those of Wu and Chu, while the empire is infinitely more stable than it was then. I beg Your Highness to take my advice. If you refuse I foresee you are bound to fail. News of your plan will leak out in advance. "I have heard that when Weizi saw the ruins of the former kingdom of Shang, he made the Song of the Millet in his grief to lament that King Zhou had not listened to Prince Bigan. And that is why Mencius said, Although Zhou was exalted as the Son of Heaven, his death was worse than that of a common man.' For King Zhou had long cut himself off from the people, it was not that they left him in the hour of his death. "Dismayed to see Your Highness cast away your position as lord of ten thousand chariots, I beg to be allowed to kill myself, that I may die here in the East Palace before all your ministers perish.” The prince sank into gloom too deep to dispel, so that tears welled up in his eyes. He rose, walked down the steps and went away.

Now the prince had a son named Buhai whose mother was a concubine. Although he was the eldest son, the prince had no love for him and neither the prince, the queen, nor the crown prince treated him as one of their family. Buhai's sonJian was talented and ambitious. He resented the crown prince's coldness to his father and the fact that the sons of all the other princes were ennobled while the son of the prince of Huainan who was not the heir was not even a marquis. He therefore formed secret connections, hoping to inform against the crown prince and overthrow him so that his father could become the heir instead. The crown prince, learning of this, had Jian arrested and flogged several times. When in the sixth year of Yuanshuo Jian discovered the crown prince's plot to kill the central tribune he made his friend Zhuang Zhi, a native of Shouchun, present this report to the emperor. Harsh medicine is bitter to taste but cures disease, loyal words offend the ear but benefit conduct. Now Jian the grandson of the prince of Huainan has abilities of a high order but is persecuted by Queen Tu and her son the crown prince Qian.Jian's father Buhai has done no wrong yet he has been arrested several times and they mean to do away with him. Jian is ready to be summoned and questioned. He knows all the secrets of the prince of Huainan. Having read this report, the emperor referred it to the chief justice, who referred it to the governor of Henan.

At this time Shen Qing, grandson of the former marquis of Piyang, was a good friend of the prime minister Gongsun Hong, and he had never forgiven Prince Li of Huainan for killing his grandfather. He painted the situation in Huainan so black that the prime minister began to suspect that the prince was plotting rebellion and determined to make a thorough investigation. The governor of Henan interrogated Jian, who incriminated the crown prince of Huainan and his followers. The prince of Huainan was alarmed and decided to rebel. He asked Wu Bei, "Does the Han court rule well or badly?" "The empire is well governed," answered Wu Bei. The prince, displeased with this reply, demanded, "Why do you say that?” "I have observed that the court administration ,the relationships between sovereign and subjects, father and son, husband and wife, senior and junior are all properly regulated,"s aid Wu Bei. “The emperor administers the realm in accordance with the ancient way and there is no breach of conventions or discipline. Wealthy merchants with heavy loads travel the length and breadth of the empire, for all the roads are open; hence trade is flourishing. The southern Yue tribes acknowledge our suzerainty, the men of Qiang and Bo in the west send tribute, the eastern tribes have surrendered, the northern frontier at Changyu has been extended, and the new province of Shuofang has been opened up. The Huns, their wings clipped and torn, are cut off from their allies and cannot stir against us. Although this cannot com- pare with the great peace of antiquity, it is nevertheless a time of good government.” The prince was furious, and Wu Bei apologized for his presumption. Then the prince questioned him again. "If fighting breaks out in the east, the Han court is bound to send Grand Marshal Wei Qing with an army to subdue the land east of the Pass. What is your estimate of the grand marshal?” "A friend of mine, Huang Yi, served under Wei Qing in a campaign against the Huns," said Wu Bei. "On his return he told me, The grand marshal is courteous to his officers and good to his men, so that all of them like to serve under him. He gallops up and down the hills as if he had wings and is of outstanding ability. To my minds a seasoned campaigner of such ability would prove hard to resist. When the imperial herald Cao Liang came from Chang³an,be described the marshal as a brilliant commander, fearless in the face of the enemy, and as one who always fights in the forefront of the battle. When the army encamps and wells are dug, he drinks only after all his men have drunk. When the army is in retreat, he crosses a river only after all his men have crossed. When the empress dowager gives him gold and silk, he presents them all to his officers. Even celebrated generals of old were no better.”The prince was silent.

Now that Jian was being cross-examined, the prince feared his plot might come to light and was eager to rebel, but Wu Bei still op- posed it. So once more the prince asked him, "Do you think the prince of Wu was right or wrong in starting his rebellion?" "I think he was wrong," said Wu Bei. “The prince of Wu enjoyed great wealth and the highest rank, but because he did wrong be perished at Dantu, his head was severed from his body, and all his sons and grandsons were wiped out. I have heard that he repented bitterly. I hope Your Highness will weigh the matter well rather than have to regret the same fate as the prince of Wu." "A brave man must be ready to die for a mere word," retorted the prince of Huainan." Besides, what did the prince of Wu know about rebellion? In one day he let over forty Han generals pass Chenggao! If I send Lou Huan to block the pass at Chenggao, send Zhou Bei from Yingchuan to block the passes of Huanyuan and Yique, and Chen Ding at the head of the troops of Nanyang to hold the Wu Pass, the governor of Henan will have nothing left but Luoyang and we need not worry about him. Further north, of course, there are still the Linjin Pass, Hedong, Shangdang, Heneiand Zhao. But there is a saying, Block Chenggao and you have nothing to fear from the rest of the empire.? Then I can seize the strongholds of Sanchuan and raise troops east of the Pass. What do you think of this plan?” "No good can come of it, nothing but disaster."

“Zuo Wu, Zhao Xian and Zhu Jiaoru think it good and almost bound to succeed. Why are you the only one to see no good in it, nothing but disaster?” “All your ministers and the officers you could trust to command troops have been imprisoned by the emperor. You have no good generals left.” “Chen She and Wu Guang had not even a pin-point of land when they rose in the marshes with a thousand men. They raised their arms and with a great call the whole empire responded. By the time they reached Xi in the west, they had rallied one million two hundred thou- sand men. My kingdom may be small, but I have more than a hundred thousand fighting men. This is much better than a bunch of conscripts with scythes, picks and wooden spears. Why do you say nothing but disaster can come of it?” "In time past the emperor of Qin defied what was right, oppressing and injuring the people. He had a retinue of ten thousand carriages, built Epang Palace, took away over half his subjects' income in taxes, and conscripted those who should have been exempt from service. Fathers were unable to support their sons, elder brothers to help their younger brothers. Harsh administration and cruel punishments made the whole country groan in distress. The people craned their necks to look for salvation and inclined their ears to listen, crying out to Heaven and beating their breasts in hatred of the emperor. That is why the whole empire responded to Chen She's call. "Now our emperor rules over a united empire,his love extends to all, his virtue and liberality are manifest. His lips do not move,yet his voice travels with the speed of a thunderbolt. He issues no order, yet his influence spreads like magic.When he wishes for something, his might is felt ten thousand li away and his subjects respond like a shadow or an echo.Furthermore, Grand Marshal Wei Qing is abler than either Zhang Han or Yang Xiong. And so I think Your Highness is mistaken to compare yourself with Chen She and Wu Guang.”

"If that is true," said the prince, “is there no chance at all?” Wu Bei replied," I have a humble plan." “What is that?” "The feudal lords have no treason in their hearts, the people no dissatisfaction. But the province of Shuofang has extensive pasture lands and is well-watered, and not enough migrants have moved there yet to populate it fully. My humble plan is to forge a petition from the prime minister and chief counsellor asking to move powerful men and gallant citizens from the provinces, to pardon prisoners serving light sentences and to settle these in Shuofang along with men who possess more than half a million cash, and all their families, dispatching soldiers to hasten their departure. Warrants issued by the law officers of the imperial clan should also be forged to arrest the sons and favourite ministers of the nobles. Then the people will murmur, the nobles will take fright, and if you send orators to incite them, you have one chance in ten of succeeding.” “That could be done," said the prince. “Although I think it hardly necessary.”

The prince summoned slaves to his palace to forge an imperial seal and the seals of the prime minister, the chief counsellor, the grand marshal, officials of the two thousand piculs rank, officials in the capital, magistrates and assistant magistrates, as well as governors and army commanders of nearby provinces. Government credentials and official caps were also made, to carry out Wu Bei's plan. The prince in addition sent men, supposedly fugitives from justice, to serve Grand Marshal Wei Qing and the prime minister. For in this way, once he called out his troops, he thought the marshal could be assassinated and the prime minister forced to surrender as easily as lifting the cover off a pot.

The prince wanted to rise in revolt, but feared his chief minister and officers of the two thousand piculs rank might not agree. So he made plans with Wu Bei to kill them first. They would pretend that the palace was on fire, and when the chief minister and other high officials came to put out the fire, they would kill them. Before putting this plan into action, the prince decided to dress some men as constables and have them arrive from the east carrying emergency orders and crying, The southern Yue tribesmen have crossed the border!” Then he would call out his troops. But before these “constables” set out to Lujiang and Kuaiji, the prince consulted Wu Bei again. "When I lead my troops west, some other princes should certainly join me," he said." But what if some refuse to answer my call?” "You must seize Hengshan to attack Lujiang,”said Wu Pei." Take the Xunyang fleet, defend the city of Xiazhi, hold the river at Jiujiang and block the Yuzhang Pass, Using strong bowmen to defend the Yangtse and keep Nanjun from falling into enemy hands. Then you can seize Jiangdu and Kuaiji in the east and ally with the Yue fighters in the south. Strongly entrenched between the Yangtse and the Huai Rivers, you should be able to hold out for a long time." "That is my best course," agreed the king. "If the worst comes to the worst, I can always flee to Yue."

Meanwhile the chief justice had reported that the crown prince of Huainan was incriminated by the prince's grandson Jian. The emperor appointed the chief justice's lieutenant as military tribune of Huainan and sent him there to arrest the crown prince. When the prince of Huainan heard that he was coming, he took counsel with his son and decided to summon the chief minister and the officials of the two thousand piculs rank to kill them before starting the revolt. The chief minister came at their summons, but the city prefect made some excuse not to appear, while the military tribune said that he had orders from the emperor not to see the prince. The prince realized that it was useless to kill the chief minister alone, in the absence of the city prefect and the military tribune, and therefore he let him go. While the prince vacillated and could not reach a decision, the crown prince reflected that since he was the one charged with plotting to kill Han's military tribune, if he were dead there would be no witnesses left.So he said to his father, "All those officers of any use to us have been arrested.There is no one we can rely on in our cause, and an untimely rising might result in failure.I am willing to give myself up.” The prince, anxious to find some way out, consented to this. And the crown prince tried to. Cut his own throat, but only wounded himself. Wu Bei went of his own accord to the authorities and made a full confession of how he had plotted revolt with the prince of Huainan, as has been related above.

Then the authorities arrested the crown prince and his mother and besieged the palace, while they searched for and arrested all those protégés of the prince who had plotted with him and were still in his kingdom. When all their findings were reported to the emperor, he ordered his ministers to investigate the matter. Several thousand men were involved in the plot, including princes, officers of the two thousand piculs rank and prominent citizens. They were punished according to the gravity of their offences. Liu Ci, the prince of Hengshan and younger brother of the prince of Huainan, was one of those involved. But when the authorities asked permission to arrest him, the emperor replied, "All the princes should be judged according to their behaviour in their own territory, not held responsible for each other's actions. Let the princes and marquises discuss the matter with the prime minister." Then forty-three nobles including Prince Pengzu of Zhao and Marquis Rang declared," Liu An, the prince of Huainan, is guilty of high treason. There is clear evidence of his plot to revolt. He should suffer the extreme penalty.” Prince Duan of Jiaoxi also said, "The prince of Huainan has broken the laws and done evil, conspiring in secret to plunge the land into chaos, deceive the people, betray the ancestral temples and spread false rumours. In the Spring and Autumn Annals we read, A subject must not even contemplate rebellion; if he does, he must die. The prince's crime is worse than contemplating rebellion, for his rebellion has taken visible form. Judging by the evidence I saw, his letters, credentials, seals, maps and other proofs of his guilt, it is very clear that he committed high treason and should suffer the full penalty of the law. With regard to his principality, all the officers above the two hundred piculs rank or those of equivalent ranks, as well as his kinsmen and favourites, even if they had no part in the plot, should be stripped of their titles and posts, reduced to the rank of commoners and debarred from holding official posts, because they failed to remonstrate with the prince. Those of them with no official post should pay a fine of two catties and eight taels of gold. This would make manifest Liu An' s guilt so that everyone in the empire understands the duty of a subject and ceases to harbour wicked and rebellious thoughts." When the prime minister Gongsun Hong and the chief justice Zhang Tang reported this, the emperor sent the officer of the imperial clan with the imperial tally and credentials to arrest the prince. Before the officer reached Huainan, the prince killed himself. His consort Tu, his son Qian and the other conspirators were executed with all their families. Since Wu Bei had spoken eloquently of the virtues of the Han Dynasty,the emperor wished to pardon him. But the chief justice said, “Wu Bei was the first to plot rebellion for the prince. His crime is unpardonable.” So Wu Bei was killed. The principality of Huainan was abolished, becoming the province of Jiujiang.

Liu Ci,the prince of Hengshan, and his consort Chengshu had three children, an elder son Shuang, the heir; a second son, Xiao; and a daughter named WuCai. The prince had four more children by his concubine Xulai, and another two by Lady Jueji. The princes of Hengshan and Huainan although brothers were not on good terms, each accusing the other of discourtesy. When the prince of Hengshan heard that the prince of Huainan was plotting rebellion, he started gathering protégés as a counter-measure, to prevent the seizure of his territory.

In the sixth year of Yuanguang, the prince of Hengshan went to court to pay homage. His herald Wei Qing, who had some knowledge of magic arts, asked to present a memorial to the throne offering his services to the emperor. The prince in a rage accused him of a capital crime and tortured him in order to obtain a confession. The city prefect of Hengshan did not believe the charge, however, and refused to prosecute. Then the prince impeached the city prefect. During his interrogation, the city prefect spoke of the prince's injustice, how more than once he had seized land from his subjects and destroyed grave yards to enlarge his estate. The authorities asked to have the prince arrested and tried, but the emperor withheld his consent, simply decreeing that all officers above the two hundred piculs rank should be appointed for him by the court. The prince of Hengshan,resenting this, began to plot with Xi Ci and Zhang Guangchang and search for strategists and astrologers. Day and night they met in secret to plot rebellion.

When the consort Chengshu died Xulai became the queen, but Lady Jueji remained a favourite too. Lady Jueji slandered her rival to Shuang, the crown prince,saying,"Xulai had a maid cast a spell on your mother to kill her. "Because of this Shuang hated Queen Xulai, and when her brother came to Hengshan Shuang drew his sword and wounded him while drinking. Then the queen in her fury kept speaking ill of the crown prince to the prince of Hengshan. The prince's daughter Wucai, who had left her husband and re- turned home, had illicit relations with a slave and a protegé. The heir apparent Shuang rebuked her for this several times, till she lost her temper and would have no more to do with him. When Queen Xulai knew this, she treated Wucai well Since Wucai and her second brother Xiao had lost their mother early, they attached themselves to Xulai, who treated them kindly so that they would help her to slander the crown prince. As a result of such slander, the prince had Shuang beaten several times. In the fourth year of Yuanshuo someone attacked and injured Queen Xulai's nurse, and the prince, suspecting that Shuang was behind this, beat him again. Later the prince fell ill but Shuang did not wait upon him, pleading illness himself. Then the queen, Wucai and Xiao denounced the crown prince, saying, "He is not really ill, only shamming. In fact, he looks very pleased.” The prince in his rage decided to disinherit Shuang and make his younger brother Xiao the heir. When the queen knew of this decision, she schemed to have Xiao repudiated as well. One of her ladies in waiting was a good dancer who enjoyed the prince's favour, and the queen told her to seduce Xiao in order to discredit him, hoping that both brothers would be disinherited and her own son Guang become crown prince instead. Shuang came to know of this plot and reflected that the only way to stop the queen's mouth was by becoming her lover. Advancing during a feast to offer a toast, he pressed her thigh and begged her to sleep with him. The queen flew into a rage and told the prince, who sent for the crown prince. He was about to have him bound and beaten when Shuang, who knew that his father had decided to disinherit him in favour of Xiao, said, "Xiao is the lover of your favourite dancer, and Wucai has been sleeping with a slave. This is true, whether you like it or not. I am going to report it to the emperor.”With that he turned and left. The prince sent a man to stop him but in vain. Then he drove off himself in pursuit and arrested him. He put him in chains and imprisoned him in the palace because of his slanderous and reckless talk. Then Xiao rose daily in favour. The prince thought so highly of his ability that he gave him a royal seal and the title of general, let him set up a separate establishment and supplied him with plenty of money to collect followers. The protégés that came to him knew that the princes of Huainan and Hengshan were plotting rebellion, so they urged him day and night to take action. The prince told two of them, Jiu He and Chen Xi, both citizens of Jiangdu, to prepare war chariots and arrows and forge imperial seals as well as the seals of generals, ministers and army officers. Day and night the prince searched for strong men like Zhou Qiu, who discussed the plans of the rebels of Wu and Chu and urged him to do likewise. The prince did not aspire to the imperial throne like the prince of Huainan, but was afraid his brother, starting a revolt, might seize his territory. All he meant to do, should the prince of Huainan march west, was to send troops to hold the region be- tween the Yangtse and the Huai Rivers.

In the autumn of the fifth year of Yuanshuo, the prince of Hengshan was due to go to court. But in the sixth year he visited Huainan, cleared up past misunderstandings with his brother and agreed to join his revolt. Then the prince of Hengshan sent a letter to court pleading illness, and the emperor wrote him a letter exempting him from paying homage at Court.

In the sixth year of Yuanshuo the prince of Hengshan sent a petition to the emperor asking permission to disinherit Shuang and make Xiao crown prince in his place. Shuang, hearing of this, got a friend named Bai Ying to go to Changan and present a report to the emperor accusing Xiao of preparing war chariots and arrows and having an affair with one of the prince's dancing girls. He hoped in this way to finish Xiao. Bai Ying reached Chang'an but for his part in the Huainan plot was arrested before he could present this report. The prince of Hengshan, learningof Bai Ying's mision and dreading exposure, sent a letter to the emperor accusing Shuang of wicked deeds for which he deserved execution in the marketplace. This matter was referred to the governor of Pei In the winter of the seventh year of Yuanishuo, the government ordered the governor of Pei to round up and arrest all those who had conspired with the prince of Huainan. Then Chen Xiwas apprehended in the house of the prince's son Xiao, and Xiao was charged with harbouring a felon. Xiao knew how often Chen Xi had plotted rebel- lion with the prince and was afraid the whole affair might come out. He had heard that according to the law an informer would be pardoned and, since he suspected that the report Bai Ying had taken for the crown prince laid bare the conspiracy, he came forward to inform against Jiu He, Chen Xi and the other conspirators. The chief justice examined the case and found the charges true. Then the high ministers asked to have the prince of Hengshan arrested and brought to trial. The emperor would not permit this, however, but sent the metropolitan tribune Sima An and the imperial herald Li Xi to question the prince, who made a full confession. The authorities set a watch upon his palace, while the metropolitan tribune and imperial herald went back to report to the court. The high ministers asked to have the imperial clan officer, the imperial herald and the governor of Pei sent to try the prince together.And when the prince heard this, he took his own life. Since Xiao had volunteered information, he was pardoned for his part in the plot to rebel but was executed in the market-place for his illicit relations with the prince's maid. Queen Xulai was charged with murdering Queen Chengshu, Shuang with the unfilial behaviour of which his father had accused him. They too were executed in the market-place. All the conspirators were killed along with their families. The principality was abolished, becoming the province of Hengshan.

The Grand Historian comments: Well does the Book of Songs say: "The northern barbarians should be punished, and those of Jing and Shu chastised. "The princes of Huainan and Hengshan were the emperor's kinsmen and ruled as princes over a thousand li of territory. Yet instead of assisting their sovereign as good vassals, they took to evil courses and plotted high treason. Thus both fathers and sons lost their land and perished themselves, becoming a laughing-stock throughout the empire. The fault lay not solely with the kings, however, for the local traditions were bad and their ministers led them into evil ways. The men of Jing and Chu are reckless,foolhardy and quick to revolt, as has been recorded since ancient times.</div>
