          <div class="txt">田单者，齐诸田疏属也。缗王时，单为临蓄市掾，不见知。及燕使乐毅伐破齐，齐滑王出奔，已而保莒城。燕师长驱平齐，而田单走安平，令其宗人尽断其车轴末而傅铁笼。己而燕军攻安平，城坏，齐人走，争途，以辖折车败，为燕所虏。唯田单宗人以铁笼故得脱，东保即墨。燕既尽降齐城，唯独莒、即墨不下。燕军闻齐王在莒，并兵攻之。淖齿既杀缗王于莒，因坚守距燕军，数年不下。燕引兵东围即墨，即墨大夫出与战，败死。城中相与推田单，曰：“安平之战，田单宗人以铁笼得全，习兵。”立以为将军，以即墨距燕。

以为将军，以即墨距燕。顷之，燕昭王卒，惠王立，与乐毅有隙。田单闻之，乃纵反间于燕，宣言曰：“齐王已死，城之不拔者二耳。乐毅畏诛而不敢归，以伐齐为名，实欲连兵南面而王齐。齐人未附，故且缓攻即墨以待其事。齐人所惧，唯恐他将之来，即墨残矣。”燕王以为然，使骑劫代乐毅。乐毅因归赵，燕人士卒忿。而田单乃令城中人食必祭其先祖于庭，飞鸟悉翔舞城中下食。燕人怪之。田单因宣言曰：“神来下教我。”乃令城中人曰：“当有神人为我师。”有一卒曰：“臣可以为师乎?”因反走。田单乃起，引还，东乡坐，师事之。卒曰：“臣欺君，诚无能也。”田单曰：“子勿言也!”因师之。每出约束，必称神师。

乃宣言曰：“吾唯惧燕军之劓所得齐卒，置之前行，与我战，即墨败矣。”燕人闻之，如其言。城中人见齐诸降者尽劓，皆怒，坚守，唯恐见得。单又纵反间曰：“吾惧燕人掘吾城外冢墓，侮先人，可为寒心。”燕军尽掘垄墓，烧死人。即墨人从城上望见，皆涕泣，俱欲出战，怒自十倍。田单知士卒之可用，乃身操版插，与士卒分功，妻妾编于行伍之间，尽散饮食飨士。令甲卒皆伏，使老弱女子乘城，遣使约降于燕，燕军皆呼万岁。田单又收民金，得千溢，令即墨富豪遗燕将，曰：“即墨即降，愿无虏掠吾族家妻妾，令安堵。”燕将大喜，许之。

燕军由此益懈。田单乃收城中得千余牛，为绛缯衣，画以五彩龙文，束兵刃于其角，而灌脂束苇于尾，烧其端。凿城数十穴，夜纵牛，壮士五千人随其后。牛尾热，怒而奔燕军，燕军夜大惊。牛尾炬火光明炫耀，燕军视之皆龙文，所触尽死伤。五千人因衔枚击之，而城中鼓噪从之，老弱皆击铜器为声，声动天地。燕军大骇，败走。齐人遂夷杀其将骑劫。燕军扰乱奔走，齐人追亡逐北，所过城邑皆畔燕而归田单，兵日益多，乘胜，燕日败亡，卒至河上，而齐七十余城皆复为齐。乃迎襄王于莒，入临蓄而听政。襄王封田单，号曰安平君。

太史公曰：兵以正合，以奇胜。善之者，出奇无穷。奇正还相生，如环之无端。夫始如处女，适人开户；后如脱兔，适不及距：其田单之谓邪! 初，淖齿之杀滑王也，莒人求滑王子法章，得之太史嫩之家，为人灌园。嫩女怜而善遇之。后法章私以情告女，女遂与通。及莒人共立法章为齐王，以莒距燕，而太史氏女遂为后，所谓“君王后”也。燕之初入齐，闻画邑人王蟠贤，令军中曰“环画邑三十里无入”，以王蜀之故。已而使人谓蟠曰：“齐人多高子之义，吾以子为将，封子万家。”

蜀固谢。燕人曰：“子不听，吾引三军而屠画邑!”王蟠曰：“忠臣不事二君，贞女不更二夫。齐王不听吾谏，故退而耕于野。国既破亡，吾不能存；今又劫之以兵为君将，是助桀为暴也。与其生而无义，固不如烹!”遂经其颈于树枝，自奋绝胆而死。齐亡大夫闻之，曰：“王蟠，布衣也，义不北面于燕，况在位食禄者乎!”乃相聚如莒，求诸子，立为襄王。</div>

          <div class="txt">田单，是齐国田氏王族的远亲。齐滑王时，田单作临蓄市场的掾吏，不为人所知。等到燕国派乐毅攻破齐国，齐滑王出逃，后来在莒城保守城池。燕军长驱直入平定了齐国，田单逃到安平，让他的同族人把他们的车轴的两头全都锯断，裹上铁箍。不久燕军攻打安平，城被攻破，齐国人逃跑，争道，因为车轴头撞折、车子毁坏，被燕军俘虏了，只有田单的同族人用铁箍裹住车轴头得以逃脱，向东退守即墨。燕国已经完全降服了齐国城邑，只有莒城、即墨没有攻下。燕军听说齐王在莒城，就合兵攻打他们。淖齿已经在莒城杀死了齐滑王，就坚守抵抗燕军，好几年没有攻下。燕国领兵向东包围了即墨，即墨大夫出来和燕军交战，战败被杀死。城中的人共同推举田单作长官，说：“安平之战，田单的同族人因为用铁箍裹住车轴头得以保全，他熟悉军事。”就立田单为将军，以即墨城防抵抗燕军。

立田单为将军，以即墨城防抵抗燕军。不久，燕昭王去世，燕惠王继位，和乐毅有嫌隙。田单听说了，就派人到燕国去行使反间计，扬言说：“齐王已经死了，城邑没有攻下的只有两座了。乐毅害怕被杀不敢回来，他以伐齐为名，实际想联合军队在齐国称王。齐国百姓尚未归附，所以姑且缓攻即墨来等待他们归顺。齐国人害怕的，只担心别的将领过来，即墨就要残破了。”燕王认为对，派骑劫代替乐毅。乐毅就归附了赵国，燕国士兵忿忿不平。田单就下令城里的人吃饭时必须先在庭院里祭祀他们的祖先，飞鸟都翱翔飞舞到城中下去啄食，燕军感到奇怪。田单就扬言说：“有神人下来教我。”就下令告知城里人说：“会有神人作我的老师。”有一个士兵说：“我可以作老师吗？”说完转身就跑。田单就站起来，招他回来，向东坐下，以对老师的礼节事奉他。士兵说：“我骗了您，确实没有才能。”田单说：“您不要说了！”就尊他为师。每当发布号令，一定要称是神师的主意。

田单扬言说：“我们只害怕燕军把俘虏的齐国士兵割去鼻子，摆到最前列和我们交战，那么，即墨就会败。”燕军听到消息，就照他说的去做。城里的人看到齐国投降的人全都被割鼻子，人人愤怒，严密防守，唯恐被俘。田单又派人反间说：“我们担心燕军挖掘城外祖宗的坟墓，侮辱先人，这会让人寒心。”燕军果真掘开坟墓，焚烧尸体。即墨人从城上望见，伤心流泪，都希望出战，愤怒增加十倍。田单知道士兵可以使用，于是亲自拿着夹板和铲子与士兵分工劳动，把妻妾编入队伍，散发饮食犒劳士兵。让全副武装的士兵埋伏，使老弱妇女登城防守，并派使者与燕军约定投降，燕军都高呼万岁。田单还收集百姓的黄金，得到一千镒，让即墨的富豪送给燕将，说：“即墨将要投降，希望不要掳掠我们家族的妻妾，让我们安居。”燕将大喜，答应了。

燕军因此更加松懈。田单就在城里收集到一千多头牛，给它们披上大红绢衣，画着五彩的蛟龙花纹，在它们角上捆上兵刃，把灌满油脂的芦苇绑到牛尾上，点燃芦苇的末端。把城墙凿了几十个洞，夜里放出牛，有五千名壮士跟随在火牛之后。牛尾着火，牛群发怒奔向燕军，燕军夜里大为惊骇。牛尾火炬光亮耀眼，燕军看到的都像是龙形图案，触及的士兵尽死伤。五千人趁机咬住牙签冲击燕军，城中人跟着鼓噪，老弱者敲铜器助阵，声音震动天地。燕军大为惊恐，溃败逃跑。齐军遂杀死燕将骑劫。燕军混乱逃窜，齐军追击北上，所经过的城邑皆背叛燕国归顺田单，军队日益增多，乘胜追击，燕军日益败亡，最终退至黄河边，齐国七十余城都恢复为齐国所辖。随后迎接襄王自莒城回到临蓄处理政务，齐襄王封田单为安平君。

太史公说：作战要以正面交锋与敌，同时出奇兵以取胜。善于用兵的人，奇兵变化无穷，奇正互生，如环无端。开始时如处女般柔弱，使敌人不设防；随后如脱兔般迅捷，使敌措手不及——这就是田单的奇计。起初，淖齿杀了齐滑王，莒城的人寻找齐滑王之子法章，在太史嫩家中找到了他，当时他在替人灌园。太史嫩的女儿怜悯他，对他很好。后来法章私下告诉她自己的身份，他们便私通。当莒人共同立法章为齐王以守莒城抵御燕国时，太史嫩的女儿便成为王后，这就是所谓“君王后”。燕国初入齐时，听说画邑人王蟠贤良，便下令军中：“环绕画邑三十里不要进入”，这是因为王蜀的关系。不久又派人对王蜀说：“齐国人多赞赏你的高义，我任命你为将，封你万家。”

“我谢绝了。”燕国人说：“你不听从，我就率三军屠杀画邑！”王蜀说：“忠臣不能事奉两个君王，贞女不能更换两个丈夫。齐王没有采纳我的劝谏，所以我退隐田野耕作。国家已经破亡，我已无所保全；现在你们又要用兵逼我做你们的将领，这无异于助桀作恶。与其活着却失去道义，不如自焚而死！”于是他把脖子挂在树枝上，奋力自尽。齐国流亡的大夫们听闻后说：“王蜀只是布衣百姓，却坚守道义不向燕国称臣，更何况我们这些在位领取俸禄的人呢！”于是大家聚集在莒城，寻找齐王的儿子，将他拥立为齐襄王。</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Tian Dan belonged to a distant branch of the royal house of Tian in the state of Qi. During the reign of King Min, he was a minor official in Linzi. When Yue Yi, a general of the state of Yan, defeated the army of Qi, King Min fled from his capital to the city of Ju, while the soldiers of Yan advanced unopposed to conquer Qi. Then Tian Dan fled to Anping and ordered his clansmen to saw off the projecting ends of their chariot-axles and fit iron guards around the stumps. When the troops of Yan took Anping by storm, the men of Qi fled, and in the melee on the road, the other chariots’ axle ends broke and their occupants were captured. Tian Dan and his kinsmen were the only ones to escape, thanks to their reinforced axles, and they went east to defend Jimo. Alone of all the cities of Qi, Ju and Jimo were holding out against Yan. As the men of Yan knew that King Min was in Ju, they attacked the city in strength. Nao Chi assassinated the king and defended Ju stubbornly, holding out against the besiegers for several years. Yan’s troops then marched east to lay siege to Jimo. Its governor going out to give battle was defeated and killed. The defenders at once chose Tian Dan to lead them, saying, “In the battle of Anping, Tian Dan’s kinsmen escaped because of the iron guards fitted to their axles. He understands warfare.” They made him their commander to defend Jimo.

Soon after this, King Zhao of Yan died. His successor, King Hui, had an aversion to Yue Yi, and when Tian Dan knew this, he sowed further dissension between them by declaring, “Qi’s king is dead and only two of its cities remain to be taken. But Yue Yi dares not return for fear of punishment. Under the pretext of subjugating Qi, he is hoping to combine his forces with those of Qi and make himself king here. He is delaying his attack so that the men of Qi may come over to his side. The one thing we fear is that another general might be appointed, for then Jimo must be destroyed.” The king of Yan believed this and made Qi Jie take over Yue Yi’s command, and Yue Yi went back to Zhao, to the great indignation of the soldiers of Yan. Then Tian Dan ordered the citizens of Jimo to sacrifice to their ancestors in the courtyard before each meal, so that birds flocked down to the city to find food, to the astonishment of the besiegers. “I have been granted a divine revelation,” announced Tian Dan. Then he told the citizens, “A man with supernatural powers will be our teacher.” “Can I be that teacher?” cried a soldier, and was running off when Tian Dan stood up and led him to a seat facing east, treating him as a teacher. “I was fooling, sir. I have no special powers,” said the soldier. “Hush!” whispered Tian Dan. He treated the man as a teacher with divine powers, and attributed all the orders he gave to his divine teacher.

Tian Dan also declared, “My one fear is lest the soldiers of Yan cut off the noses of the captured Qi soldiers and place them in the front ranks against us. For then Jimo is doomed.” The men of Yan, hearing this, acted accordingly. When the defenders saw that all the surrendered men had their noses cut off, they were furious and fortified their defenses, determined not to be captured. Tian Dan also spread a rumor, saying, “We fear the invaders will dig up the graves outside the city and desecrate our ancestors, which would chill our hearts.” The Yan army proceeded to dig up the graves and burn the corpses. The people of Jimo, seeing this from the city walls, wept and were eager to fight, their anger tenfold. Knowing that the soldiers were ready, Tian Dan himself worked with them, wielding tools and sharing the labor. He organized his wives and concubines into the ranks, distributed food and drink to the soldiers, and had the armored men lie in ambush while the old and weak and women mounted the walls. Envoys were sent to negotiate surrender with the Yan army, prompting great cheers from the enemy. Tian Dan also collected a thousand yi of gold from the populace, which the wealthy citizens of Jimo presented to the Yan general, saying, “Jimo is about to surrender. Please spare our wives, concubines, and kinsmen, so that we may live in peace.” The Yan general was delighted and agreed.

The Yan army became increasingly lax. Tian Dan gathered more than a thousand bulls inside the city, swathed them in red silk, painted them with multicolored dragon patterns, tied daggers to their horns, and attached oil-soaked reeds to their tails, setting the reeds on fire. Dozens of breaches were made in the city walls, and at night the bulls were released, followed by five thousand brave soldiers. Enraged by their burning tails, the bulls charged the Yan troops, who were greatly alarmed in the night. The flaming tails shone brightly, and to the Yan soldiers, the patterns looked like dragons, killing or wounding all they touched. The five thousand soldiers then charged, holding sticks in their mouths, and the city residents shouted and beat drums in unison, while the old and weak beat copper vessels to make a thunderous noise. The Yan army, terrified, fled in disorder. The Qi forces killed the Yan general Qi Jie. As the Yan troops fled north in confusion, every city they passed defected to Tian Dan, whose army grew daily. Taking advantage of successive victories, the Yan forces were repeatedly defeated, and eventually retreated to the Yellow River, leaving all seventy-plus cities of Qi restored. Tian Dan then escorted King Xiang from Ju to Linzi to govern, and the king enfeoffed Tian Dan as Lord of Anping.

The Grand Historian comments: In war, one engages the enemy head-on with regular tactics while employing surprise tactics to win. A skilled commander’s use of surprise is boundless, and the interplay between regular and surprise tactics is endless, like a circle without beginning or end. Initially passive like a young girl, lulling the enemy into complacency, then swift as an escaped hare, overtaking them unexpectedly—this describes Tian Dan’s surprise tactics. When Nao Chi assassinated King Min, the people of Ju sought out his son Fazhang, finding him working as a gardener in the house of Taishi Nen. The daughter of the family took pity on him and treated him kindly. Fazhang privately revealed his identity to her, and they became lovers. Later, when the people of Ju crowned Fazhang as king to hold the city against Yan, she became the queen, the so-called “Chief Lady.” When Yan first entered Qi, they heard that Wang Pan of Huayi was virtuous, and issued an order forbidding troops to enter a thirty-li area around his residence, because of Wang Shu’s connection. Soon after, messengers told Wang Shu, “The people of Qi praise your virtue. We appoint you as a general and grant you ten thousand households.”

Wang Chu firmly declined. The envoys said, “If you do not agree, we shall lead three armies to destroy Huayi district!” Wang Chu replied, “A loyal minister cannot serve two masters, and a chaste woman cannot change husbands. Since the king of Qi ignored my advice, I retired to till the fields. The kingdom is already lost and I have nothing to preserve; now you try to force me to be your general, which is aiding a tyrant in his oppression. Rather than live without virtue, I choose to die!” He then tied his neck to a tree branch and broke it with a strong effort, ending his life. When the exiled ministers of Qi heard of this, they said, “Wang Chu was a commoner, yet he refused to submit to Yan. How much more should those of us in office with salaries uphold righteousness!” They then gathered at Ju, sought out the prince, and crowned him as King Xiang of Qi.</div>
