          <div class="txt">孟尝君名文，姓田氏。文之父曰靖郭君田婴。田婴者，齐威王少子而齐宣王庶弟也。田婴自威王时任职用事，与成侯邹忌及田忌将而救韩伐魏。成侯与田忌争宠，成侯卖田忌。田忌惧，袭齐之边邑，不胜，亡走。会威王卒，宣王立，知成侯卖田忌，乃复召田忌以为将。

宣王二年，田忌与孙膑、田婴俱伐魏，败之马陵，虏魏太子申而杀魏将庞涓。宣王七年，田婴使于韩、魏，韩、魏服于齐。婴与韩昭侯、魏惠王会齐宣王平阿南，盟而去。明年，复与梁惠王会甄。是岁，梁惠王卒。

宣王九年，田婴相齐。齐宣王与魏襄王会徐州而相王也。楚威王闻之，怒田婴。明年，楚伐败齐师于徐州，而使人逐田婴。田婴使张丑说楚威王，威王乃止。田婴相齐十一年，宣王卒，湣王即位。即位三年，而封田婴于薛。

初，田婴有子四十余人，其贱妾有子名文，文以五月五日生。婴告其母曰：“勿举也。”其母窃举生之。及长，其母因兄弟而见其子文于田婴。田婴怒其母曰：“吾令若去此子，而敢生之，何也？”文顿首，因曰：“君所以不举五月子者，何故？”婴曰：“五月子者，长与户齐，将不利其父母。”文曰：“人生受命于天乎？将受命于户邪？”婴默然。文曰：“必受命于天，君何忧焉。必受命于户，则可高其户耳，谁能至者！”婴曰：“子休矣。”

久之，文承间问其父婴曰：“子之子为何？”曰：“为孙。”“孙之孙为何？”曰：“为玄孙。”“玄孙之孙为何？”曰：“不能知也。”文曰：“君用事相齐，至今三王矣，齐不加广而君私家富累万金，门下不见一贤者。文闻将门必有将，相门必有相。今君后宫蹈绮縠而士不得短褐，仆妾余粱肉而士不厌糟糠。今君又尚厚积余藏，欲以遗所不知何人，而忘公家之事日损，文窃怪之。”于是婴乃礼文，使主家待宾客。宾客日进，名声闻于诸侯。诸侯皆使人请薛公田婴以文为太子，婴许之。婴卒，谥为靖郭君。而文果代立于薛，是为孟尝君。

孟尝君在薛，招致诸侯宾客及亡人有罪者，皆归孟尝君。孟尝君舍业厚遇之，以故倾天下之士。食客数千人，无贵贱一与文等。孟尝君待客坐语，而屏风后常有侍史，主记君所与客语，问亲戚居处。客去，孟尝君已使使存问，献遗其亲戚。

孟尝君曾待客夜食，有一人蔽火光。客怒，以饭不等，辍食辞去。孟尝君起，自持其饭比之。客惭，自刭。士以此多归孟尝君。孟尝君客无所择，皆善遇之，人人各自以为孟尝君亲己。

秦昭王闻其贤，乃先使泾阳君为质于齐，以求见孟尝君。孟尝君将入秦，宾客莫欲其行，谏，不听。苏代谓曰：“今旦代从外来，见木禺人与土禺人相与语。木禺人曰：‘天雨，子将败矣。’土禺人曰：‘我生于土，败则归土。今天雨，流子而行，未知所止息也。’今秦，虎狼之国也，而君欲往，如有不得还，君得无为土禺人所笑乎？”孟尝君乃止。

齐湣王二十五年，复卒使孟尝君入秦，昭王即以孟尝君为秦相。人或说秦昭王曰：“孟尝君贤，而又齐族也，今相秦，必先齐而后秦，秦其危矣。”于是秦昭王乃止，囚孟尝君，谋欲杀之。孟尝君使人抵昭王幸姬求解。幸姬曰：“妾愿得君狐白裘。”此时孟尝君有一狐白裘，直千金，天下无双，入秦献之昭王，更无他裘。孟尝君患之，遍问客，莫能对。最下坐有能为狗盗者，曰：“臣能得狐白裘。”乃夜为狗，以入秦宫臧中，取所献狐白裘至，以献秦王幸姬。幸姬为言昭王，昭王释孟尝君。

孟尝君得出，即驰去，更封传，变名姓以出关。夜半至函谷关。秦昭王后悔出孟尝君，求之已去，即使人驰传逐之。孟尝君至关，关法鸡鸣而出客，孟尝君恐追至，客之居下坐者有能为鸡鸣，而鸡齐鸣，遂发传出。出如食顷，秦追果至关，已后孟尝君出，乃还。始孟尝君列此二人于宾客，宾客尽羞之，及孟尝君有秦难，卒此二人拔之。自是之后，客皆服。

孟尝君过赵，赵平原君客之。赵人闻孟尝君贤，出观之，皆笑曰：“始以薛公为魁然也，今视之，乃眇小丈夫耳。”孟尝君闻之，怒。客与俱者下，斫击杀数百人，遂灭一县以去。

齐湣王不自得，以其遣孟尝君。孟尝君至，则以为齐相，任政。孟尝君怨秦，将以齐为韩、魏攻楚，因与韩、魏攻秦，而借兵食于西周。苏代为西周谓曰：“君以齐为韩、魏攻楚九年，取宛、叶以北以强韩、魏，今复攻秦以益之。韩、魏南无楚忧，西无秦患，则齐危矣。韩、魏必轻齐畏秦，臣为君危之。

君不如令敝邑深合于秦，而君无攻，又无借兵食。君临函谷而无攻，令敝邑以君之情谓秦昭王曰‘薛公必不破秦以强韩、魏。其攻秦也，欲王之令楚王割东国以与齐，而秦出楚怀王以为和’。君令敝邑以此惠秦，秦得无破而以东国自免也，秦必欲之。楚王得出，必德齐。齐得东国益强，而薛世世无患矣。秦不大弱，而处三晋之西，三晋必重齐。”薛公曰：“善。”

因令韩庆贺秦，使三国无攻，而不借兵食于西周矣。是时，楚怀王入秦，秦留之，故欲必出之。秦不果出楚怀王。

孟尝君相齐，其舍人魏子为孟尝君收邑入，三反而不致一入。孟尝君问之，对曰：“有贤者，窃假与之，以故不致入。”孟尝君怒而退魏子。居数年，人或毁孟尝君于齐湣王曰：“孟尝君将为乱。”及田甲劫湣王，湣王意疑孟尝君，孟尝君乃奔。

魏子所与粟贤者闻之，乃上书言孟尝君不作乱，请以身为盟，遂自刭宫门以明孟尝君。湣王乃惊，而踪迹验问，孟尝君果无反谋，乃复召孟尝君。孟尝君因谢病，归老于薛。湣王许之。

其后，秦亡将吕礼相齐，欲困苏代。代乃谓孟尝君曰：“周最于齐，至厚也，而齐王逐之，而听亲弗相吕礼者，欲取秦也。齐、秦合，则亲弗与吕礼重矣。有用，齐、秦必轻君。君不如急北兵，趋赵以和秦、魏，收周最以厚行，且反齐王之信，又禁天下之变。齐无秦，则天下集齐，亲弗必走，则齐王孰与为其国也！”于是孟尝君从其计，而吕礼嫉害于孟尝君。

孟尝君惧，乃遗秦相穰侯魏冉书曰：“吾闻秦欲以吕礼收齐，齐，天下之强国也，子必轻矣。齐秦相取以临三晋，吕礼必并相矣，是子通齐以重吕礼也。若齐免于天下之兵，其仇子必深矣。子不如劝秦王伐齐。齐破，吾请以所得封子。齐破，秦畏晋之强，秦必重子以取晋。晋国敝于齐而畏秦，晋必重子以取秦。是子破齐以为功，挟晋以为重；是子破齐定封，秦、晋交重子。若齐不破，吕礼复用，子必大穷。”于是穰侯言于秦昭王伐齐，而吕礼亡。

后齐湣王灭宋，益骄，欲去孟尝君。孟尝君恐，乃如魏。魏昭王以为相，西合于秦、赵，与燕共伐破齐。齐湣王亡在莒，遂死焉。齐襄王立，而孟尝君中立于诸侯，无所属。齐襄王新立，畏孟尝君，与连和，复亲薛公。文卒，谥为孟尝君。诸子争立，而齐、魏共灭薛。孟尝绝嗣无后也。

初，冯驩闻孟尝君好客，蹑蹻而见之。孟尝君曰：“先生远辱，何以教文也？”冯驩曰：“闻君好士，以贫身归于君。”孟尝君置传舍十日，孟尝君问传舍长曰：“客何所为？”答曰：“冯先生甚贫，犹有一剑耳，又蒯缑。弹其剑而歌曰‘长铗归来乎，食无鱼’。”孟尝君迁之幸舍，食有鱼矣。五日，又问传舍长。答曰：“客复弹剑而歌曰‘长铗归来乎，出无舆’。”孟尝君迁之代舍，出入乘舆车矣。五日，孟尝君复问传舍长。舍长答曰：“先生又尝弹剑而歌曰‘长铗归来乎，无以为家’。”孟尝君不悦。

居期年，冯驩无所言。孟尝君时相齐，封万户于薛。其食客三千人，邑入不足以奉客，使人出钱于薛。岁余不入，贷钱者多不能与其息，客奉将不给。孟尝君忧之，问左右：“何人可使收债于薛者？”传舍长曰：“代舍客冯公形容状貌甚辩，长者，无他伎能，宜可令收债。”孟尝君乃进冯驩而请之曰：“宾客不知文不肖，幸临文者三千余人，邑入不足以奉宾客，故出息钱于薛。薛岁不入，民颇不与其息。今客食恐不给，愿先生责之。”冯驩曰：“诺。”辞行，至薛，召取孟尝君钱者皆会，得息钱十万。乃多酿酒，买肥牛，召诸取钱者，能与息者皆来，不能与息者亦来，皆持取钱之券书合之。齐为会，日杀牛置酒。酒酣，乃持券如前合之，能与息者，与为期；贫不能与息者，取其券而烧之。曰：“孟尝君所以贷钱者，为民之无者以为本业也；所以求息者，为无以奉客也。今富给者以要期，贫穷者燔券书以捐之。诸君强饮食。有君如此，岂可负哉？”坐者皆起，再拜。

孟尝君闻冯驩烧券书，怒而使使召驩。驩至，孟尝君曰：“文食客三千人，故贷钱于薛。文奉邑少,而民尚多不以时与其息，客食恐不足，故请先生收责之。闻先生得钱，即以多具牛酒而烧券书，何?”冯獾曰：“然。不多具牛酒即不能毕会,无以知其有余不足。有余者，为要期。不足者，虽守而责之十年,息愈多，急，即以逃亡自捐之。若急，终无以偿,上则为君好利不爱士民，下则有离上抵负之名,非所以厉士民彰君声也。焚无用虚债之券,捐不可得之虚计,令薛民亲君而彰君之善声也，君有何疑焉?”孟尝君乃拊手而谢之。

齐王惑于秦、楚之毁，以为孟尝君名高其主而擅齐国之权，遂废孟尝君。诸客见孟尝君废，皆去。冯驩曰：“借臣车一乘可以入秦者，必令君重于国而奉邑益广，可乎？”孟尝君乃约车币而遣之。

冯驩乃西说秦王曰：“天下之游士凭轼结軶西入秦者，无不欲强秦而弱齐；凭轼结軶东入齐者，无不欲强齐而弱秦。此雄雌之国也，势不两立为雄，雄者得天下矣。”秦王跽而问之曰：“何以使秦无为雌而可？”

冯驩曰：“王亦知齐之废孟尝君乎？”秦王曰：“闻之。”冯驩曰：“使齐重于天下者，孟尝君也。今齐王以毁废之，其心怨，必背齐；背齐入秦，则齐国之情，人事之诚，尽委之秦，齐地可得也，岂直为雄也！君急使使载币阴迎孟尝君，不可失时也。如有齐觉悟，复用孟尝君，则雌雄之所在未可知也。”

秦王大悦，乃遣车十乘、黄金百镒以迎孟尝君。冯驩辞以先行，至齐，说齐王曰：“天下之游士凭轼结軶东入齐者，无不欲强齐而弱秦；凭轼结軶西入秦者，无不欲强秦而弱齐。夫秦齐雄雌之国，秦强则齐弱矣，此势不两雄。”

今臣窃闻秦遣使车十乘载黄金百镒以迎孟尝君。孟尝君不西则已，西入相秦则天下归之，秦为雄而齐为雌，雌则临淄、即墨危矣。王何不先秦使之未到，复孟尝君，而益与之邑以谢之？孟尝君必喜而受之。秦虽强国，岂可以请人相而迎之哉！折秦之谋，而绝其霸强之略。”

齐王曰：“善。”乃使人至境候秦使。秦使车适入齐境，使还驰告之，王召孟尝君而复其相位，而与其故邑之地，又益以千户。秦之使者闻孟尝君复相齐，还车而去矣。

自齐王毁废孟尝君，诸客皆去。后召而复之，冯驩迎之。未到，孟尝君太息叹曰：“文常好客，遇客无所敢失，食客三千有余人，先生所知也。客见文一日废，皆背文而去，莫顾文者。今赖先生得复其位，客亦有何面目复见文乎？如复见文者，必唾其面而大辱之。”

冯驩结辔下拜。孟尝君下车接之，曰：“先生为客谢乎？”冯驩曰：“非为客谢也，为君之言失。夫物有必至，事有固然，君知之乎？”孟尝君曰：“愚不知所谓也。”

曰：“生者必有死，物之必至也；富贵多士，贫贱寡友，事之固然也。君独不见夫趣市朝者乎？明旦，侧肩争门而入；日暮之后，过市朝者掉臂而不顾。非好朝而恶暮，所期物亡其中。今君失位，宾客皆去，不足以怨士而徒绝宾客之路。愿君遇客如故。”

孟尝君再拜曰：“敬从命矣。闻先生之言，敢不奉教焉。”

太史公曰：吾尝过薛，其俗闾里率多暴桀子弟，与邹、鲁殊。问其故，曰：“孟尝君招致天下任侠、奸人入薛中盖六万余家矣。”世之传孟尝君好客自喜，名不虚矣。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">孟尝君姓田名文，他的父亲是靖郭君田婴。田婴是齐威王的小儿子、齐宣王的异母弟，他早从齐威王在世的时候就在朝里做官掌权，曾经与成侯邹忌以及田忌一起带兵伐魏救韩。后来邹忌与田忌争宠，邹忌在齐王面前陷害田忌。田忌害怕，于是铤而走险地率兵袭击齐国边境城市，结果失败，逃走了。后来威王去世，宣王即位，知道当时是邹忌谗害了田忌，就把田忌重新招回来仍旧让他做将军。

齐宣王二年，田忌和孙膑、田婴一起领兵伐魏，在马陵道打败魏军，活捉魏国太子申，杀掉魏国大将庞涓。齐宣王七年，田婴先后到韩国和魏国出使，使韩国和魏国都服从齐国。田婴还带着韩昭侯和魏惠王到齐国平阿的南面会见齐宣王，签订盟约后离开。第二年，又和梁惠王在齐国的甄县举行会谈。同一年，梁惠王去世。

齐宣王九年，田婴做了齐国宰相。也就在这一年，齐宣王和魏襄王在徐州会晤，达成协议互相承认对方为王。楚威王听到这个消息，对田婴很不满。第二年，楚国出兵在徐州大败齐军，并且派人威迫齐王罢逐田婴，直到田婴请张丑去劝说楚威王，楚威王才作罢。田婴做了十一年齐国宰相，齐宣王去世，湣王即位。湣王即位三年，把薛县封给了田婴。

起初，田婴有四十多个儿子，其中一个不受宠的小妾生了个儿子叫田文，田文生于五月初五。田婴对他母亲说：“不要养活这个孩子。”但他母亲还是偷偷把田文养活下来。等田文长大后，他母亲通过田文的兄弟把田文引见给田婴。田婴对田文的母亲发怒说：“我当时让你扔掉这个孩子，你竟敢把他养活，为什么？”田文上前叩头，问道：“您不让养活五月出生的孩子，是什么原因？”田婴说：“五月出生的孩子，长到和门一样高时，会对父母不利。”田文说：“人的命运是由上天决定的，还是由门的高度决定的？”田婴沉默不语。田文又说：“如果命运由上天决定，您担忧什么？如果由门的高度决定，那就把门修高，谁还能长到和门一样高呢！”田婴说：“你别说了。”

过了很久，田文找机会问他父亲：“儿子的儿子是什么？”田婴说：“是孙子。”田文又问：“孙子的孙子是什么？”田婴说：“是玄孙。”田文再问：“玄孙的孙子是什么？”田婴说：“不知道了。”田文说：“您在齐国当宰相，到现在经历了三代君主，齐国的土地没有扩展，可您家里却积攒了万金财富，门下见不到一个贤能的人。我听说将门出将，相门出相。现在您的姬妾穿着绫罗绸缎，而士人却穿不上粗布短衣；您的仆人婢妾有吃不完的饭肉，而士人却连糟糠都吃不饱。您还在不断积累财富，想留给不知是谁的后代，却不关心国家事务日益衰败，我私下里感到奇怪。”从此田婴开始敬重田文，让他主持家务、接待宾客。宾客一天天增多，田文的名声传遍诸侯各国。诸侯都派人来请求薛公田婴立田文为继承人，田婴答应了。田婴去世后，谥号为靖郭君。田文果然在薛县继承爵位，这就是孟尝君。

孟尝君在薛县时，招揽各国宾客以及犯罪逃亡的人，这些人都来归附孟尝君。孟尝君拿出自己的家产优厚地款待他们，因此天下的士人都来投奔他。他的食客有几千人，无论出身贵贱，都和孟尝君待遇相同。孟尝君接待宾客坐着谈话时，屏风后常常有侍史，负责记录他和宾客的谈话内容，询问宾客亲戚的住处。宾客离开后，孟尝君就已派人去慰问宾客的亲戚，并赠送礼物。

有一次孟尝君夜间招待宾客吃饭，有个宾客坐在火光照不到的地方。这个宾客生气了，认为饭菜不一样，停下筷子要离开。孟尝君站起来，端着自己的饭去和他的饭对比。那个宾客感到惭愧，自杀了。士人因此更多地归附孟尝君。孟尝君对宾客来者不拒，都优厚款待，每个宾客都觉得孟尝君对自己很亲近。

秦昭王听说孟尝君有才干，就派了泾阳君来到齐国做人质，他是想用这个办法骗得孟尝君也到秦国去。孟尝君果然动心要去了。他手下的那些宾客都不愿让他去，大家纷纷劝阻，孟尝君执意不听。这时苏代过来对他说：“今天早上我从外面回来，看到了一个木偶和一个泥胎在那里谈话。木偶对泥胎说：‘天快下雨了，天一下雨你就得瘫掉。’泥胎对木偶说：‘我是泥做的，瘫掉之后仍是回到泥里。可是你呢？天一下雨，雨水就要把你冲走，那你就不知道要被冲到哪里去了。’如今的秦国，像虎狼一样凶狠，可是您还非要到他们那里去，万一您回不来，那还不落个被泥胎讥笑的下场吗？”孟尝君一听，这才决定不去了。

齐湣王二十五年，齐国还是派孟尝君去了秦国，秦昭王一见，立即任命他做了秦国的宰相。这时有人对秦昭王说：“孟尝君有才干，又是齐王的本家，今天您让他当秦国的宰相，肯定他是先为齐国打算然后才为秦国打算的，这样一来，秦国就有危险了。”秦昭王一听，就改变了主意，把孟尝君关了起来，准备杀死他。孟尝君只好派人到秦昭王的一个宠姬那里去求救。这个宠姬说：“我希望得到您那件白狐狸皮做的大衣。”当时孟尝君的确有一件白狐狸皮做的大衣，价值千金，普天下找不出第二件，可是他一到秦国就已经把它送给了秦昭王，现在手上再没有什么可送了。孟尝君很为此事伤脑筋，他问遍了身边的宾客，没有一个能想得出什么办法。这时一个坐在最下位的专会偷鸡摸狗的宾客出来说：“我有办法弄到白狐狸皮大衣。”于是他在夜间像狗一样地钻进了秦国宫中的仓库，偷回了孟尝君送给秦昭王的那件皮大衣，让孟尝君又把它送给了秦昭王的宠姬。这样，宠姬在秦昭王面前替孟尝君一说好话，秦昭王就把孟尝君释放了。

孟尝君一被释放，就赶紧逃走，他们自己伪造了通行证，改名换姓，准备混出关去。结果在半夜时他们来到了函谷关，这时秦昭王已经后悔放孟尝君走了，当他再派人去找，发现孟尝君已经走了，于是秦昭王又马上派人坐着驿车去追。孟尝君来到函谷关下，按照守关的规定，是要等鸡叫才能开门放行的。孟尝君正在害怕追兵来到而没有办法，这时他的下等客人中有一个会学鸡叫的，他这么学着鸡一叫，顿时周围的鸡也都叫了起来，城门大开，孟尝君等交验了护照，而后就被放出关去了。等到他们过关后大约一顿饭的工夫，秦昭王派的人果然追到了关下。但是他们已经太晚，只好空手回去了。当初孟尝君收留这两个鸡鸣狗盗的客人时，其他宾客都觉得和他们在一起是一种耻辱，等到孟尝君这次在秦国遇到了危险，全是靠着这两个人救了他，这以后，宾客们才都对他们服气了。

孟尝君路过赵国时，赵国的平原君接待了他。赵国人听说孟尝君有本事，都出来看。结果一看，大家都笑了，说：“起先我们还都以为薛公是个大高个子，现在一看，才知道原来是个小矮人。”孟尝君一听，勃然大怒。他的那些宾客、侍从下车去一阵乱杀乱砍，杀死了几百人，灭掉了一个县，而后才离去。

齐湣王为这次派孟尝君去秦国差点遇害而心里感到不安，所以孟尝君一回来，就让他当了齐国的宰相，管理国家大事。孟尝君怨恨秦国，于是就以齐国曾经帮着韩国和魏国打过楚国为理由，要求韩国和魏国这回帮着自己攻打秦国，同时向西周“借”粮食和武器。这时苏代为了西周的利益对孟尝君说：“您叫齐国帮着韩国、魏国打楚国，打了九年，夺取了楚国的宛县、叶县，加强了韩国、魏国的力量，如今您又要攻打秦国，再给韩国、魏国增加好处。如果让韩国和魏国南边没有楚国的威胁，西边没有秦国的威胁，那您齐国就要危险了。到那时韩国和魏国必然会轻视齐国而害怕秦国，这事我很为您感到危险。

您不如让我们西周和秦国搞好关系，您不要去打它，也不要去向它借粮食借武器。您只要把军队开到函谷关，而不要和秦国开战，您可以让西周去对秦王这样说：‘孟尝君是肯定不会攻打秦国而让韩国、魏国得到好处的。他之所以摆出一个进攻秦国的样子，是想要秦王迫使楚襄王把他们东方的一部分地区割让给齐国，而希望您也放回被扣在秦国的楚怀王来作为与楚国和解的条件。’您让西周把这个好意告诉秦王，秦国能够因为楚国割让他们东方的一部分领土而解除了齐国的进攻，它是一定会同意的。而楚国则会因为怀王被释，也来感激您的好处。齐国得到了楚国的东部地区也会变得更强大，而您的封地薛县也就会世世代代没有危险了。秦国没有受到太大的削弱，它处在三晋的西边，三晋怕秦，势必永远依靠齐国。”孟尝君说：“你说得对。”

于是他让韩庆去向秦国表示友好，让齐国、韩国、魏国都不再攻打秦国，也不再去向西周“借”粮食和武器了。当时，楚国正因为楚怀王入秦而被秦国扣留了，所以他们急于想让秦国放了他，但是秦国始终没有放。

在孟尝君当齐国宰相的时候，他的一个姓魏的门客到薛县去给他征收租税，去了三次都没有带回来一点东西。孟尝君问他，他回答说：“我遇到了一个贤人，就把讨上来的钱财借给他用了，所以没能交给您。”孟尝君很生气地打发他下去了。几年以后，有人在齐湣王跟前毁谤孟尝君说：“孟尝君想要造反。”等到后来田甲造反劫持了齐湣王的时候，齐湣王怀疑是孟尝君干的。孟尝君无法，只好逃到了国外。

这时魏先生借给他钱的那位贤人知道了，就到朝廷门口来给齐王上书，证明孟尝君没有反，并说愿以自己的生命作证明，说罢就在王宫的门前自杀了，以此证明孟尝君的清白。齐湣王吃了一惊，经过调查了解后，知道孟尝君的确没有谋反的打算，于是就把他重新招了回来。而孟尝君则称说有病，要求辞去职务，回自己的封地养老。齐湣王同意了。

后来，从秦国逃亡出来的吕礼在齐国做了宰相，他想给苏代一些苦头吃。苏代就对孟尝君说：“周最在齐国时，对齐国是非常好的，可是后来齐王把他赶走了。齐王听信亲弗的话而让吕礼做了宰相，其目的是讨好秦国。如果齐国真的和秦国关系好起来，那么亲弗和吕礼可就要受宠了。如果他们俩一旦被重用，齐国和秦国就一定会轻视您。因此您不如赶紧向北方出兵，驱使赵国去和秦国、魏国结好，劝齐王重新招回周最，并加倍地厚待他。这样既可以改变齐王想同秦国结好的念头，又可以防止其他国家产生一系列的变化。只要齐国不与秦国联盟，那么东方各国就一定都会向齐国靠拢，那时亲弗就必然会自己离去，到那时，除了您，齐王还能和谁一起来治理国家呢？”于是孟尝君就照苏代说的去做了，结果使得吕礼对孟尝君非常痛恨。

孟尝君为此也很恐惧，于是就给秦国的丞相穰侯写了一封信说：“我听说秦国正想通过吕礼来结交齐国，而齐国可是一个强大的国家，假如这件事让吕礼办成了，那您在秦国的地位可就下降了。到那时如果齐国和秦国联合起来一道去威胁韩、赵、魏三国，那么吕礼就有可能一个人兼任几个国家的宰相。这样一来，您交好齐国的结果，只落了个抬高吕礼，让他得了好处。如果齐国因此局势稳定，各国不敢再动它，那么吕礼就会挑动着齐国更加憎恨您。您现在不如劝说秦王来攻打齐国。齐国一旦被打败，我帮您向秦王请求，把秦国占领的地盘都给您做封邑。齐国一旦被打败，那么能够对秦国构成威胁的就只有魏国了，那时秦王就必然要重用您去结好魏国。魏国是刚刚被齐国打败的，而且也怕秦国，这样他们就必然会来求着您交好秦国。到那时，您既有打败齐国的功劳，又有拉拢魏国的作用。这样一来，您就会又立功，又受赏，还叫秦国、魏国都看重您，这有多好呢？如果不打败齐国，让吕礼继续在齐国掌权，那您今后的日子将会很难过。”穰侯一听，立即劝秦昭王出兵伐齐，搞得吕礼只好离开了齐国。

后来齐湣王消灭了宋国，开始变得越来越骄傲了，他一心只想把孟尝君赶走。孟尝君也很害怕，就去了魏国。魏昭王很高兴，立即让他做了魏国的宰相，于是孟尝君就向西联合了秦国、赵国，跟着燕国一起打败了齐国。齐湣王逃到莒县，死在了那里。齐襄王刚刚即位的时候，孟尝君在各国之间保持中立，哪个国家也不归。齐襄王很怕他，于是就主动地去与他联合，重新和他保持亲近。田文死后，被谥为孟尝君。当他的儿子们正为了继承权而争持不下时，齐国和魏国联合起来灭掉了薛县，使得孟尝君家从此连根都绝了。

开始时，冯驩听说孟尝君好客，于是就穿着一双草鞋去见他了。孟尝君说：“先生大老远地来到这里，准备给我什么指教呢？”冯驩说：“就是因为听说您好客，所以就来了。”于是孟尝君就把他安置在了一个普通的客馆里。过了十天，孟尝君问客馆的总管说：“冯驩在做些什么？”总管说：“冯驩非常穷，只有一把剑，剑柄缠着一些草绳子。他每天在弹着剑唱歌，说：‘长剑哪，我们还是走吧，这里连鱼都没得吃！’”孟尝君听罢就让总管把冯驩升到了比原先稍好一些的客馆里，让他每顿饭都有了鱼吃。又过了五天，孟尝君又向总管问冯驩的情况，总管说：“冯驩还在那里弹着剑唱歌，说：‘长剑哪，我们还是走吧，这里出门连个车也没有！’”孟尝君听罢就让总管把他安置到了一个更好的客馆里，让他进进出出的都有了车子坐。又过了五天，孟尝君又问总管，总管说：“冯驩还在那里弹着剑唱歌，说：‘长剑哪，我们还是走吧，住在这里连个养家的钱也没有！’”孟尝君听了心里不大高兴。

过了一年，在这一年里冯驩什么动静也没有。这时孟尝君正是齐国的宰相，齐王把一个有着万户人家的薛县给了他作封地。孟尝君当时有门客三千人，光靠这块封地的税收是养活不了这些人的。于是他就让人给他在薛县放了许多债，可是一年过去了，什么也没有得到，借钱的都不肯交利息，养客的费用眼看就要接不上了。孟尝君很着急，他问身边的人们说：“谁可以帮我到薛县去收债呢？”客馆总管说：“上等客馆里的那个冯先生相貌出众，而且像个厚道人，这个人没有什么别的本事，让他去收债我看还是可以的。”于是孟尝君就把冯驩找了来，对他说：“诸位客人不嫌我没出息，到我这里来的有三千多人，我封地上的那点收入不够奉养这些宾客，所以我在薛县放了一些钱。可是近年来薛县的收成不好，百姓们不少人都不交利息。现在宾客们的吃用眼看要接不上了，所以我想请你帮着去那里催讨一下。”冯驩说：“好的。”于是他辞别了孟尝君，很快来到了薛县。冯驩召集凡是借了孟尝君家钱的人都来开会，一共得到了十万钱的利息。随后冯驩又买来了许多美酒、肥牛，然后告诉那些借钱的人们，能还利息的人们要来，不能还利息的也要来，大家都要带着借券来当场核对一下。等到大家到齐后，就杀牛摆了酒，请大家开怀畅饮。在大家正喝得起劲时，冯驩拿出了借券和大家一一地进行了核对，能够交利息的，和他约定一个交钱的时期；贫穷无力交息的，就干脆把他们的借券要回来烧掉了。冯驩说：“孟尝君之所以要放这些钱，是为了给无法生活的人提供一点谋生的本钱；他之所以要大家交一点利息，那是因为他缺少奉养宾客的用度。现在凡是家庭富裕的都约定了一个交钱的日期；家里贫穷无力偿还的，我已经烧了你们的借据，那些钱不再向你们要了。请大家多保重。有这么好的主子，难道我们还忍心背叛他吗？”于是席上的人们都站了起来，一再地叩头致谢。

孟尝君听了冯驩烧借据的消息，立刻生气地派人去把冯驩叫了回来。冯驩一到，孟尝君就说：“因为我家里有三千客人要吃饭，所以我才到薛县去放债。我封地的收入不多，借钱的人们又不按时交利息，我连养客的伙食都怕开不出来了，所以才请你去讨要。可是我听说你收了债以后，买了许多牛、酒，还把一些债券都烧了，你这么干是为什么呢?”冯驩说：“不错。不多准备一些牛酒，他们就不会都来，也就没有办法知道他们谁是富裕的谁是穷困的。对于那些富裕的，可以和他们定一个交利息的日期；对于那些穷困的，即使你拿着债券向他讨要十年也仍是要不到东西。利息越滚越多，逼急了，他们来个一逃了事，还是叫您什么也得不到。您再逼得紧，那也是没用的。这样闹的结果是，从上说您要落个只知道贪图私利而不知道爱护百姓的名声；从下说也让百姓们都得落个背叛主子逃避债务的罪名，这么做恐怕不是教育提高子民、给自己扬名的好办法。现在我们烧掉那些有名无实的债券，送掉那些无法收上来的徒有虚名的钱财，使薛县的百姓们忠于您，给您扬名，这有什么不好呢?”孟尝君一听，拍手称绝，立即向冯驩表示感谢。

后来齐王听信了秦国和楚国的挑拨，认为孟尝君的名声比自己还大，而且又独揽着齐国的大权，于是就罢掉了孟尝君的职务。孟尝君门下那些宾客们一见孟尝君被废，很快都纷纷离他而去。这时冯驩对孟尝君说：“您给我一辆能去秦国的车子，我一定能让您重新在齐国受到重视，并且让您的封地更加广阔，您看可以吗？”孟尝君随即备好车马和礼物，送冯驩出发。

冯驩西行来到秦国，对秦王说：“天下所有驾着马车向西来秦国的游说之士，没有一个不是想让秦国强大、使齐国削弱的；所有驾着马车向东去齐国的游说之士，没有一个不是想让齐国强大、使秦国削弱的。秦、齐两国是分不出雌雄的对手，势必不能同时称雄，称雄的一方就能夺取天下。”秦王挺直身子跪坐着问道：“怎样才能让秦国不沦为雌而称雄呢？”

冯驩说：“大王听说齐国罢免孟尝君的事了吗？”秦王说：“听说了。”冯驩说：“使齐国在天下获得重视的，正是孟尝君啊。如今齐王因谗言罢免了他，他心中怨恨，必定会背离齐国；如果他背离齐国来到秦国，那么齐国的国情、人事的实情，都会全部告知秦国，到时秦国不仅能称雄，还能夺取齐国的土地！大王赶紧派人带着礼物暗中去迎接孟尝君，千万不能错过时机。要是齐王醒悟过来，重新任用孟尝君，那今后秦、齐谁雌谁雄就难以预料了。”

秦王十分高兴，立即派遣十辆马车、携带百镒黄金去迎接孟尝君。冯驩请求先动身返回齐国，到了齐国后，他对齐王说：“天下所有驾着马车向东来齐国的游说之士，没有一个不是想让齐国强大、使秦国削弱的；所有驾着马车向西去秦国的游说之士，没有一个不是想让秦国强大、使齐国削弱的。秦、齐两国是分不出雌雄的对手，秦国强大了，齐国就会削弱，这是无法同时称雄的形势。”

“如今我私下听说秦国已派十辆马车、载着百镒黄金来迎接孟尝君了。孟尝君不去秦国倒也罢了，要是他向西去秦国做了宰相，天下各国都会归附秦国，秦国称雄而齐国沦为雌，一旦沦为雌，临淄、即墨就危险了。大王为何不在秦国使者到来之前，恢复孟尝君的职位，再增加他的封地向他道歉呢？孟尝君必定会高兴地接受。秦国即便强大，又怎能把别国的宰相请走呢！这样做既能挫败秦国的阴谋，又能断绝它称霸天下的计划。”

齐王说：“好。”随即派人到边境等候秦国使者。秦国使者的车马刚进入齐国境内，等候的人就飞马回报齐王，齐王立刻召见孟尝君，恢复了他的宰相职位，还把原来的封地还给了他，又额外增加了一千户。秦国使者听说孟尝君重新担任齐国宰相，便掉转车马回去了。

自从齐王因谗言罢免孟尝君后，他门下的宾客全都离开了。后来齐王召回孟尝君并恢复他的职位，冯驩前去迎接。还没到京城，孟尝君叹息道：“我一向喜好招揽宾客，对待宾客从不敢有半点怠慢，门下食客有三千多人，这是先生您知道的。可宾客们见我一被罢免，就都背弃我离开，没有一个顾及我的。如今靠先生帮忙我才恢复职位，那些宾客还有什么脸面来见我呢？要是他们再来见我，我必定往他们脸上吐唾沫，狠狠羞辱他们一番。”

冯驩勒住缰绳，下车行拜礼。孟尝君赶紧下车扶起他，说：“先生是为那些宾客求情吗？”冯驩说：“我不是为宾客求情，而是因为您的话错了。世间万物都有必然的结局，事情都有固有的规律，您明白吗？”孟尝君说：“我愚笨，不明白您说的意思。”

冯驩说：“有生命的事物终究会死亡，这是万物必然的结局；人富贵时宾客多，贫贱时朋友少，这是事情固有的规律。您难道没见过那些赶集的人吗？清晨，他们侧着肩膀争抢着进集市门；到了傍晚，经过集市的人甩着胳膊就走，连看都不看一眼。不是他们喜欢清晨、厌恶傍晚，而是集市里没有他们想要的东西了。如今您失去职位，宾客们离开，不值得怨恨他们，否则只会白白断绝宾客前来投奔的路。希望您还像从前一样对待宾客。”

孟尝君拜了两拜说：“我恭敬地听从您的教导。听了先生的话，我怎敢不遵照执行呢。”

太史公说：我曾经路过薛县，那里民间的风俗是，街巷里大多是凶暴蛮横的年轻人，和邹国、鲁国的民风截然不同。询问其中的原因，有人说：“孟尝君当年招揽天下喜好侠义、触犯法律的人到薛县来，大概有六万多家呢。”世间传说孟尝君以招揽宾客为乐，这个名声确实不假啊。</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Lord Mengchang's name was Tian Wen. His father Tian Ying, Lord Jingguo, was the youngest son of King Wei of Qi and a half brother of King Xuan. Tian Ying served in the government under King Wei and led troops with Zou Ji the marquis of Cheng and Tian Ji in the campaign against Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.) to rescue Han (403B.C.-230B.C.). Then Zou Ji and Tian Ji contended for power, the former slandered the latter, and Tian Ji in alarm tried to storm a border town of Qi but fled after defeat. Upon King Wei's death King Xuan ascended the throne and, knowing that Tian Ji had been the victim of slander, he recalled him and made him a general.

In the second year of King Xuan, Tian Ji, Sun Bin and Tian Ying led troops against Wei and won the battle of Maling, capturing the crown prince Shen and killing General Pang Juan. In the seventh year of King Xuan, Tian Ying went as an envoy to Han and Wei to win them as allies for Qi. He escorted Marquis Zhao of Han and King Hui of Wei to a conference with King Xuan south of Donga, where an agreement was reached. The following year, the king of Qi conferred again with King Hui of Wei at Zhen. Later that year King Hui died.

In the ninth year of King Xuan, Tian Ying became prime minister of Qi. King Xuan conferred with King Xiang of Wei at Xuzhou, where both took the title of king. The news of this made King Wei of Chu angry with Tian Ying. The following year Chu defeated Qi at Xuzhou and dispatched men to drive away Tian Ying; but he sent Zhang Chou to intercede with the king of Chu, who relented. Tian Ying remained prime minister of Qi for eleven years. Then King Xuan died, King Min came to the throne, and three years later Tian Ying received Xue as his fief.

Tian Ying had more than forty sons. On the fifth day of the fifth month one of his low-born concubines gave birth to a son named Wen, and Tian Ying ordered her to abandon the child. She secretly kept him, however, and when he grew up induced his brothers to introduce him to his father. Tian Ying was angry with the mother and said, "I told you to get rid of this child. How dare you bring him up?" Wen bowed and asked, "What was your reason, sir, for abandoning a son born on that day?" "When a child born on the fifth day of the fifth month grows as high as the door he will do his parents harm." "Is man's fate controlled by Heaven or by the height of a door?" When his father could not answer, Wen continued, "If man's fate is controlled by Heaven, what's the good of worrying? If it is controlled by a door, why not make the door higher so that no one can equal its height?" At that Tian Ying said, "Very well, you may go."

Some time later Wen asked his father, “What is the son of a son?” "A grandson," was the reply. “What is the grandson of a grandson?” “A great-great-grandson.” “What is the grandson of a great-great-grandson?” "I don't know." "You have served as prime minister of Qi during three reigns," said Wen, “yet the territory of Qi has not increased. Your private estate is worth ten thousand pieces of gold, yet not one man of talent can be found among your followers. I have heard that a general's family should produce generals, a minister's family should produce ministers. Now your concubines are clothed in fine silk, while the gentlemen serving you wear ragged jackets; your slaves and concubines have grain and meat to spare, while your guests go hungry on husks. And you are amassing yet more wealth to leave to some unknown descendants, paying less and less attention to public affairs. To my mind, this is rather strange.” Tian Ying then treated him with more respect, putting him in charge of family affairs and of guests. Gradually more and more guests flocked to him so that his fame spread far and wide through the states. And when envoys from various states asked Tian Ying to make Wen his heir, he agreed to do so. Tian Ying was given the posthumous title of Lord Jingguo. Tian Wen succeeded to his fief as Lord Mengchang of Xue.

Lord Mengchang invited gentlemen to Xue from various states as well as refugees and felons flying from justice, using his fortune to entertain them handsomely. So gentlemen came to him from all over the land. He entertained several thousand protégés, treating all like himself with no distinction of rank. When he sat talking with the guests he had invited, there was always a scribe behind the screen to record their conversations and ascertain their relatives' whereabouts; and after the visitors' departure he sent messengers with gifts for their families.

One night when he gave a banquet, one of his guests who was sitting in the shadow lost his temper, fancying that he was receiving inferior fare. He stopped eating and begged to take his leave. At once Lord Mengchang rose and took his own meal over to compare with this fellow's. Then the man killed himself for shame. For reasons like these many gentlemen flocked to Lord Mengchang, who treated all well without discrimination so that each felt he was the lord's special friend.

When news of this admirable behaviour reached King Zhao of Qin, he sent Lord Jinyang as a hostage to Qi in order to invite Lord Mengchang to pay him a visit. The lord was eager to go, but all his protégés were against it. He turned a deaf ear, however, to their warnings. Then Su Dai said, "This morning on my way here, I heard a wooden figure talking to one of clay. 'It is raining,' said the wooden figure. 'You will crumble and collapse.' The clay figure retorted, 'I am made of earth and if I crumble I shall simply return to the earth. But the rain will carry you off and there is no knowing where you will end.' Now Qin is like a tiger or wolf, yet you are eager to go there. If you fail to return, the clay figure will laugh at you." Then Lord Mengchang relinquished his plan.

In the twenty-fifth year of King Min of Qi, Lord Mengchang was none the less sent to Qin, and King Zhao of Qin made him his prime minister. Someone warned King Zhao, "Lord Mengchang is an able man and related to the royal house of Qi. He is bound to put Qi's interests first, to the detriment of our state." Thereupon King Zhao removed Lord Mengchang from office and put him under house arrest, meaning to kill him later. Lord Mengchang sent an appeal for help to the king's favourite concubine. Her answer was, "I would like the lord's white fox fur." Now Lord Mengchang, upon his arrival in Qin, had presented King Zhao with a fox fur worth a thousand pieces of gold, which was without its equal in the world, and of course he had no other. In dismay, he consulted his protegés, but none of them could think of any solution. Among his humblest followers, however, was a thief who could pretend to be a dog, and this fellow said, "I can get that white fox fur for you." That night, passing himself off as a dog, he slipped into the palace storeroom and brought out the fur. When this was presented to the concubine, she interceded on Lord Mengchang's behalf and King Zhao released him.

As soon as he was free he galloped off with forged documents in another name and reached the Hangu Pass by midnight. By then the king had regretted releasing him and summoned him, only to find that he had already left. Men were sent in hot pursuit. Now the pass was closed and there was a rule that no one might go through before cock-crow. Lord Mengchang feared that he would be overtaken, but another of his humblest followers was able to imitate the crow of a cock, and because this set all the other cocks crowing too the fugitives were able to go through. In the time it takes to eat a meal the pursuers reached the pass, but finding Lord Mengchang gone went back again. When Lord Mengchang first accepted these two men as protégés, the others had despised them, yet it was these two who saved him from danger in Qin. And after this no more was said against them.

When Lord Mengchang was passing through Zhao, Lord Pingyuan entertained him. The people of Zhao, who had heard of his fame, came out to see him but only jeered at him. "We expected the lord of Xue to be a powerful man," they said. "But now we see he is a puny fellow." When the lord heard this he was angry. His followers drew their swords and laid about them until they had killed several hundred men, nor did they stop till they had wiped out an entire county.

King Min of Qi regretted having sent Lord Mengchang away, and on his return made him prime minister in charge of the government. Because he bore a grudge against the king of Qin, Lord Mengchang wanted to attack Qin instead of joining forces with Han and Wei against Chu and he asked Western Zhou for a loan of grain for the army. Su Dai, on behalf of Western Zhou, said to him, "For nine years you have attacked Chu to help Han and Wei and strengthened them by taking land north of Wan and Ye. Now if you attack Qin that will make Han and Wei even stronger, and if they feel no threat from Qin in the west or Chu in the south, they will be a serious threat to you. They will fear Qin but despise Qi, and I think this is dangerous for you.

It would be much better to let our state ally closely with Qin while you neither attack Qin nor borrow grain for the army. You can halt at the Hangu Pass while we convey your wishes to King Zhao of Qin, saying, 'The lord of Xue will not defeat Qin to make Han and Wei strong. He has advanced in the hope that you will ask the king of Chu to give his eastern territory to Qi, while you send back King Huai of Chu to make peace.' If you let us do this favour to Qin, they will certainly consent, for they can avoid defeat by giving you Chu's eastern territory. And the king of Chu will also be grateful to Qi for his release. Qi will be strengthened by the acquisition of the eastern territory, and your fief of Xue will be secure for ever. Since Qin will thus still be powerful on the western frontiers of Han and Wei, those states will have to treat Qi with respect.” The lord approved of this plan.

He made Han and Wei send gifts to Qin, called a halt to the joint expedition and refrained from borrowing grain from Western Zhou. At this time King Huai of Chu was detained in Qin and his state was anxious for his return, but in the event Qin did not let him go.

While Lord Mengchang was prime minister of Qi, his steward Wei Zi, who collected revenue for him from his fief, went three times without once handing it over. When questioned, he replied that he had given the grain to a worthy man, and the lord angrily dismissed him. A few years later, slanderers told King Min that Lord Mengchang was about to revolt. And subsequently the king suspected that Lord Mengchang was behind Tian Jia's attack upon him. So the lord ran away.

When this news came to the ears of the worthy man to whom Wei Zi had given grain, he wrote to the king declaring that Lord Mengchang would never rebel—he would stake his life on this. And he killed himself at the palace gate to prove the lord's innocence. The king was shocked into investigating the matter, found Lord Mengchang innocent, and recalled him. Lord Mengchang, on the pretext of illness, asked permission to go to his own fief and this was granted.

Later Lü Li, a general who had deserted from Qin, became prime minister of Qi. He wanted to injure Su Dai, who told Lord Mengchang: "Zhou Zui has rendered great services to Qi, yet the king dismissed him and on Qin Fu's advice has made Lü Li prime minister. This is because he wants to win over Qin. If Qi and Qin become allies, Qin Fu and Lü Li will hold power while you will count for nothing with Qi or Qin. Lose no time, then, in leading an army north towards Zhao, making peace with Qin and Wei, and inviting Zhou Zui back to show your appreciation; for in this way you will regain the king's confidence and put a stop to all possible changes. Once Qi is independent of Qin, the other states will flock to us and Qin Fu will be forced to leave. Then the king will have to find someone else to manage affairs of state." Lord Mengchang took his advice, but was hated by Lü Li for this.

Fearing reprisals, the lord wrote to Wei Ran, the marquis of Rang and prime minister of Qin, "I hear that your king wants with Lü Li's help to win over Qi. But since Qi is a powerful state, you are bound to become less influential. Moreover when Qi and Qin combine against Han and Wei, Lü Li will be prime minister in both our states. This is what will come of allying with Qi and exalting Lü Li. So long as Qi is not threatened by other states, it is bound to regard you as its worst enemy; so you had better persuade your king to attack it. If Qi is defeated, I can propose that the territory won from it should be given to you, and fear of the might of Han, Wei and Zhao will make the king of Qin rely on you to win them over. At the same time, since these states were threatened by Qi and fear Qin, they will rely on you to win Qin over. In this way you will gain credit by defeating Qi and gain power, thanks to Han, Wei and Zhao. Your fief will be enlarged and Qin and Han, Wei and Zhao will respect you more. On the other hand, if Qi is not defeated and Lü Li remains prime minister, you will find yourself in serious trouble." Then the marquis of Rang advised King Zhao of Qin to attack Qi, and Lü Li sought safety in flight.

The conquest of Song later made King Min of Qi arrogant and he wanted to rid himself of Lord Mengchang, who took fright and went to Wei, where King Zhao appointed him prime minister. Having allied with Qin and Zhao in the west, Wei joined forces with Yan to attack Qi and King Min fled to Ju, where he died. When King Xiang ascended the throne of Qi, Lord Mengchang became the ruler of an independent state. Since King Xiang was newly come to the throne he feared the lord's power and made a pact with him, whereby they became reconciled. At the lord's death he received the posthumous title of Lord Mengchang. His sons contended for the succession, but Qi and Wei together attacked and destroyed the state of Xue, so that no one succeeded to the title.

Before this, when Feng Huan heard that Lord Mengchang was good to his guests, he came to see him wearing straw sandals. "You have come from far away, sir," said Lord Mengchang. "What instruction have you for me?" "I hear that you are good to gentlemen," said Feng Huan, "and being poor I have come to seek your protection." Lord Mengchang installed him in a hostel and ten days later asked the steward in charge, "What is our guest doing?" The answer was, "Master Feng is very poor. He owns nothing but a sword with a plaited reed round its hilt. He beats his sword and sings, 'Let's go back, long sword! Here I have no fish to eat.'" Then Lord Mengchang moved Feng Huan to a better hostel where he could have fish for his meals. Five days later he questioned the steward again and was told, "That guest is still beating his sword and singing, 'Let's go back, my long sword. Here I have no carriage to go out in?'" Then Lord Mengchang moved Feng Huan to a still better hostel, where he had the use of a carriage. Five days later he questioned the steward again and was told, "The gentleman is still beating his sword and singing, 'Let's go back, my long sword. Here I have no house of my own.'" Lord Mengchang was annoyed.

And Feng Huan stayed there for over a year without saying anything to him. At that time Lord Mengchang was prime minister of Qi with a fief of ten thousand households at Xue, but since he was supporting three thousand protégés his income was not enough to meet his expenditure, so he used to lend money in Xue. Then there came a famine and he could not get his money back, for most of his debtors were unable to pay the interest. Worried because he could not meet his expenses, Lord Mengchang asked his men to recommend someone to go to Xue to collect debts for him. His steward said, "Master Feng who stays in the best hostel seems a man of great eloquence and a fine-looking gentleman, but he has no other gifts. You might send him." Lord Mengchang invited Feng Huan over and told him, "More than three thousand gentlemen, overestimating my talents, have honoured me with their presence. Since my income is insufficient to meet this outlay, I have put out money at interest in Xue. But the crops there have failed and the people have not paid the interest, so that I may be unable to defray my expenses. I would like to trouble you for your help." Feng Huan accepted this mission and left. Upon his arrival in Xue, he summoned all Lord Mengchang's debtors who owed interest amounting to a hundred thousand coins. He prepared wine in abundance and fat oxen and invited them all to come whether they could discharge their debts or not, bringing with them records of their loans. On the appointed day, he had the oxen slaughtered and brought out the wine, and while they drank he checked their documents. He agreed to a date with those who were able to pay and burned the receipts of others who were too poor. "Lord Mengchang lent you money to supply you with capital to make a start," he told them. "He asked for interest because he needs money to entertain his proteges. So now we are setting a time limit for those who are well-off and burning the receipts of those too poor to discharge their debt. Eat and drink your fill, gentlemen, and do your best for a lord who treats you so well." Then all the men rose from their seats and bowed their thanks.

When Lord Mengchang heard that Feng Huan had burned the receipts,he angrily recalled him."Because I have three thousand guests living on me,I lent money in Xue,"he said.“Since my fief is small and my people do not always pay the interest,I was afraid I might not have enough for my guests and asked you to collect the money.But I hear that you used the funds to  buy  oxen  and  wine  in  abundance,after  which  you  burned  the documents.Why was this?”"That is right,"said Feng Huan."If I hadn't prepared plenty of oxen and wine,not all of them would have come and I shouldn't have known which had money and which had not.I set a time limit for those in a position to pay.As for those who have no money,even ifI  were to wait around for ten years the interest would simply accumulate  until in desperation they ran away.In that event,apart from receiving  no payment,you would win the reputation of a miser with no regard  for the people,while they would be guilty of absconding.This is no  way to improve the people's morale and increase your reputation.Burn- ing those useless deeds and not attempting to dun the destitute will  endear you to the people of Xue and spread your fame.Why do you  doubt  this,sir?” Then Lord Mengchang clapped his hands and apologized.

When slanderers from Qin and Chu convinced the king of Qi that Lord Mengchang's fame outdid his own and that he had usurped state power, the king dismissed him from office. And as soon as he ceased to be prime minister most of his protégés left. "Lend me a chariot to go to Qin," said Feng Huan, "and I shall make the king of Qi think so highly of you that he will increase your fief. How would you like that?" Lord Mengchang prepared a chariot and gifts and saw him off.

Feng Huan travelled west to Qin and told the king, "All those travelling politicians who ride west in their chariots to Qin are eager to strengthen Qin and weaken Qi, while those who go east to Qi are eager to strengthen Qi and weaken Qin. These two states are rivals, they cannot both reign supreme. The one which proves superior will conquer the world." The king of Qin sat up and asked, "How can I make Qin more powerful?"

"Have you heard, sir, that the king of Qi has dismissed Lord Mengchang?" "Yes, I heard that." "It was Lord Mengchang who gave Qi status in the eyes of the world. Now that the king has dismissed him because of slander, he must bear a grudge against Qi. If he comes here, he can give you a full and true account of that state and its people, enabling you to conquer Qi. Will that not make you more powerful? Make haste, sir; send a messenger with gifts and invite him over secretly. Don't let this opportunity slip! If the king of Qi awakes to his mistake and makes Lord Mengchang prime minister again, it is hard to say which state will prove supreme."

The king of Qin, well pleased with this advice, sent ten chariots bearing a hundred yi of gold with an invitation to Lord Mengchang. Feng Huan asked leave to go first and when he reached Qi he advised the king of Qi, saying: "All those travelling politicians who ride east to Qi in their chariots are eager to strengthen Qi and weaken Qin, while those who go west to Qin are eager to strengthen Qin and weaken Qi. Since these two states are rivals, if Qin is strengthened Qi must be weakened. They cannot both reign supreme."

"Now I hear that the king of Qin has sent ten chariots bearing a hundred yi of gold to Lord Mengchang with an invitation. If the lord remains here, well and good; if he travels west to serve as prime minister of Qin, the world will follow Qin. It will be the superior state and yours the inferior, and your chief cities Linzi and Jimo will be endangered. Why not restore the lord to his position and increase his fief to show your gratitude before the arrival of the envoy of Qin? He is bound to be pleased and accept, and however powerful Qin may be it can hardly invite another state's prime minister. In this way you can upset Qin’s designs and thwart its scheme of conquest."

The king of Qi approved and sent a messenger to the frontier to look out for the envoy from Qin. As soon as the envoy's chariots had crossed the frontier the messenger galloped back to report to the king, who forthwith summoned Lord Mengchang and reinstated him as prime minister, restoring to him his former fief with an additional thousand households. When word of this reached the envoy from Qin, he turned his chariots round and drove home again.

When the king of Qi dismissed Lord Mengchang on account of slander, all the lord's protégés left him. Now that he was summoned to be reinstated, Feng Huan alone went to meet him. While they were on the road Lord Mengchang sighed and said, "I used to enjoy collecting protégés and always treated them as well as I could. More than three thousand gentlemen lived upon me, as you know. But the day that they saw I was dismissed, they left without any regard for me at all. Thanks to your help I have been reinstated, but how can those men meet my eyes again? If they come to see me, I shall have to spit in their faces and insult them."

Feng Huan tied up his reins, got down from the chariot and bowed. Lord Mengchang alighted to raise him up and asked, "Are you apologizing for those guests?" "No, indeed," replied Feng Huan. "I disagree with you. Don't you know that all things must take their natural course and follow their own law?" "I am too foolish to understand what you mean."

"All that lives must die: that is the nature of things. The rich and noble have many friends while the poor have few: that is the general law. Have you never noticed people going to the market? In the morning they crowd and shoulder their way through the gate, whereas after dusk they turn away without a look behind. This is not because they like the market in the morning and dislike it in the evening, but because the things they want are no longer there. The fact that all your guests left when you lost your position is no reason for you to complain. If you do, you will simply stop them from returning. I hope you will treat them exactly as before."

Lord Mengchang bowed and said, "With all respect I shall act upon your advice, sir."

The Grand Historian comments: I once visited the district of Xue and found many of the local people there were hot-tempered young men very different from those of Zou and Lu. Upon asking the reason, I was told that Lord Mengchang had invited over sixty thousand families of gallant men and outlaws from far and wide to settle in Xue. Evidently there is truth in the report that Lord Mengchang loved entertaining protégés.</div>
