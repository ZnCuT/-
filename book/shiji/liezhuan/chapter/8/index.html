          <div class="txt">季布者，楚人也。为气任侠，有名于楚。项籍使将兵，数窘汉王。及项羽灭，高祖购求布千金，敢有舍匿，罪及三族。季布匿濮阳周氏。周氏曰:“汉购将军急，迹且至臣家，将军能听臣，臣敢献计;即不能，愿先自刭。” 季布许之。乃髡钳季布，衣褐衣，置广柳车中，并与其家僮数十人，之鲁朱家所卖之。朱家心知是季布，乃买而置之田，诫其子曰:“田事听此奴，必与同食。”朱家乃乘轺车之洛阳，见汝阴侯滕公。滕公留朱家饮数日。因谓滕公曰:“季布何大罪，而上求之急也?”

滕公曰:“布数为项羽窘上，上怨之，故必欲得之。”朱家曰：“君视季布何如人也?”曰：“贤者也。”朱家曰：“臣各为其主用，季布为项籍 用，职耳。项氏臣可尽诛邪?今上始得天下，独以己之私怨求一人，何示天下之不广也!且以季布之贤而汉求之急如此，此不北走 胡即南走越耳。夫忌壮士以资敌国，此伍子胥所以鞭荆平王之墓 也。君何不从容为上言邪?”汝阴侯滕公心知朱家大侠，意季布匿 其所，乃许曰：“诺。”待间，果言如朱家旨。上乃赦季布。当是时，诸公皆多季布能摧刚为柔，朱家亦以此名闻当世。季布召见，谢，上拜为郎中。

孝惠时，为中郎将。单于尝为书嫚吕后，不逊，吕后大怒，召诸将议之。上将军樊哙曰：“臣愿得十万众，横行匈奴中。”诸将 皆阿吕后意，曰：“然。”季布曰：“樊哙可斩也!夫高帝将兵四十余万众，困于平城，今哙奈何以十万众横行匈奴中，面欺!且秦以事于胡，陈胜等起。于今创痍未瘳，哙又面谀，欲摇动天下。”是时殿上皆恐，太后罢朝，遂不复议击匈奴事。

季布为河东守，孝文时，人有言其贤者，孝文召，欲以为御史大夫。复有言其勇，使酒难近。至，留邸一月，见罢。季布因进曰：“臣无功窃宠，待罪河东。陛下无故召臣，此人必有以臣欺陛下者。今臣至，无所受事，罢去，此人必有以毁臣者。夫陛下以 一人之誉而召臣， 一人之毁而去臣，臣恐天下有识闻之有以窥陛下也。”上默然惭，良久曰：“河东吾股肱郡，故特召君耳。”布辞之官。

楚人曹丘生，辩士，数招权顾金钱。事贵人赵同等，与窦长 君善。季布闻之，寄书谏窦长君曰：“吾闻曹丘生非长者，勿与通。”及曹丘生归，欲得书请季布。窦长君曰：“季将军不说足 下，足下无往。”固请书，遂行。使人先发书，季布果大怒，待曹丘。曹丘至，即揖季布曰：“楚人谚曰‘得黄金百，不如得季布一诺’,足下何以得此声于梁楚间哉?且仆楚人，足下亦楚人也。 仆游扬足下之名于天下，顾不重邪?何足下距仆之深也!”季布乃大说，引入，留数月，为上客，厚送之。季布名所以益闻者，曹丘扬之也 。

季布弟季心，气盖关中，遇人恭谨，为任侠，方数千里，士皆 争为之死。尝杀人，亡之吴，从袁丝匿。长事袁丝，弟畜灌夫、籍 福之属。尝为中司马，中尉郅都不敢不加礼。少年多时时窃籍其名以行。当是时，季心以勇，布以诺，著闻关中。

季布母弟丁公，为楚将。丁公为项羽逐窘高祖彭城西，短兵 接，高祖急，顾丁公曰：“两贤岂相厄哉!”于是丁公引兵而还，汉王遂解去。及项王灭，丁公谒见高祖。高祖以丁公徇军中，曰： “丁公为项王臣不忠，使项王失天下者，乃丁公也。”遂斩丁公，曰：“使后世为人臣者无效丁公!”

栾布者，梁人也。始梁王彭越为家人时，尝与布游。穷困，赁佣于齐，为酒人保。数岁，彭越去之巨野中为盗，而布为人所 略卖，为奴于燕。为其家主报仇，燕将臧荼举以为都尉。臧荼后 为燕王，以布为将。及臧荼反，汉击燕，虏布。梁王彭越闻之， 乃言上，请赎布以为梁大夫。

使于齐，未还，汉召彭越，责以谋反，夷三族。已而枭彭越头于洛阳下，诏曰：“有敢收视者，辄捕之。”布从齐还，奏事彭越头下，祠而哭之。吏捕布以闻。上召布，骂曰：“若与彭越 反邪?吾禁人勿收，若独祠而哭之，与越反明矣。趣亨之。”方 提趣汤，布顾曰：“愿一言而死。”上曰：“何言?”布曰：“方上之困于彭城，败荥阳、成皋间，项王所以不能遂西，徒以彭王 居梁地，与汉合从苦楚也。当是之时，彭王一顾，与楚则汉破，与汉而楚破。且垓下之会，微彭王，项氏不亡。天下已定，彭王 剖符受封，亦欲传之万世。今陛下一征兵于梁，彭王病不行，而陛下疑以为反，反形未见，以苛小案诛灭之，臣恐功臣人人自危也。今彭王已死，臣生不如死，请就亨。”于是上乃释布罪，拜为都尉。

孝文时，为燕相，至将军。布乃称曰：“穷困不能辱身下志，非人也；富贵不能快意，非贤也。”于是尝有德者厚报之，有怨者必以法灭之。吴楚反时，以军功封俞侯，复为燕相。燕齐之间皆为栾布立社，号曰栾公社。景帝中五年薨。子贲嗣，为太常，牺牲不如令，国除。

太史公曰：以项羽之气，而季布以勇显于楚，身屦军搴旗者数矣，可谓壮士。然至被刑戮，为人奴而不死，何其下也!彼必自负其材，故受辱而不羞，欲有所用其未足也，故终为汉名将。贤者诚重其死。夫婢妾贱人感慨而自杀者，非能勇也，其计画无复之耳。栾布哭彭越，趣汤如归者，彼诚知所处，不自重其死。虽往古烈士，何以加哉!</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">季布，是楚国人。仗义行侠，在楚国很有名。项籍派他率领	军队，多次使汉王陷于困境。到项羽被消灭后，高祖悬赏千金捉拿季布，敢有窝藏的，连坐三族。季布躲在濮阳一个姓周的人家。周氏说:“汉朝悬赏捉拿将军很急，追查踪迹很快要到我家里了，将军如果能够听从我，我愿意替你出个计策;如果不能，我情愿先在你面前自杀。”季布答应了他。于是周氏给季布剃去头发套上铁锁，换上粗布衣服，让他坐进运棺材的车里，和周家的数十名家僮一起，到鲁县把他们卖给朱家。朱家心里知道是季布，就买了下来将他安排到田里去干活，并告诫他的儿子说:“田里的事情听由这个家奴自己去做，你一定要和他一起吃饭。”朱家于是坐轻便马车到洛阳，见汝阴侯滕公。滕公留朱家喝了几天酒。朱家乘机对滕公说:“季布犯了什么大罪，皇上捉他这么急？″

滕公说：“季布好几次替项羽把皇上逼入困境，皇上怨恨他，因此一定要捉到他。”朱家说：“您看季布是个什么样的 人?”滕公说：“是个贤能的人。”朱家说：“臣子各自替自己的主 子尽力，季布替项羽尽力，这是他的职责而已。项氏的臣子难道 能统统斩尽杀光吗?当今皇上刚刚得到天下，仅仅为了自己的私仇 而四处搜捕这么一个人，这是告诉天下的人自己的心胸是多么不 广阔!况且像季布这样贤能的人而汉朝搜捕他急成这样，这使他不 是向北逃往匈奴，就是向南逃往南越。像这种嫉恨壮士反而逼他 去帮助敌国的事情，就是伍子胥之所以会对楚平王掘墓鞭尸的缘 故。您为什么不找个机会对皇上说说呢?”汝阴侯滕公心里知道朱 家是一位大侠，料想季布就躲藏在他家中，便答应说：“好。”等 到有了机会，滕公果然照朱家的意思向皇上进言。皇上于是赦免了季布。在这个时候，大家都赞赏季布能变刚为柔，朱家也因此而闻名当世。季布被皇上召见，感谢了皇上的赦免之恩，皇上任命他做郎中。

孝惠帝的时候，季布担任中郎将。匈奴单于曾写信侮辱吕 后，对吕后出言不逊，吕后大怒，召集众将领来商议这件事。上将军樊哙说：“我愿意带领十万兵马，在匈奴境内横冲直撞。”各 位将领都迎合吕后的心意，说：“对。”季布说：“樊哙该杀!高祖 带兵四十多万人，尚且被匈奴围困在平城，现在樊哙怎么可能凭 十万人就在匈奴境内横冲直撞呢，真是当面骗人!况且秦朝正是因 为对胡人用兵，才引起陈胜等的暴动。至今战争的创伤还没有医治好，樊哙又当面阿谀逢迎，企图使天下陷于动荡。”这时殿上 的人都非常惊恐，太后退朝，就不再商议征伐匈奴的事了。

季布担任河东郡守，孝文帝的时候，有人推荐说他很贤能，孝文帝召见他，想任用他做御史大夫。又有人说他勇敢，爱喝酒使性子，令人难以亲近。季布到京城，留在客馆里住了一个月， 文帝见过就不理他了。季布因此向皇上进言说：“我无功而受宠， 得以在河东担任郡守。陛下平白无故地召见我，这一定是有人拿我来欺骗陛下。现在我到了，没有什么事情，就这样让我回去， 这就一定有人在陛下面前讲我的坏话。陛下因为有一个人称赞我 便召见我，因为有一个人诋毁我便让我回去，我担心天下有识之士听说了这件事就会由此看出您的深浅来了。”皇上默不作声， 心中惭愧，过了好一会儿才说：“河东是我最重要的郡，所以特地召见你罢了。”季布便告辞回到河东任上。

楚人曹丘生，是一个能言善辩的人，曾多次用金钱巴结权贵。他侍奉权贵赵同等人，与窦长君要好。季布听说这件事后，寄信劝窦长君说：“我听说曹丘生不是个有德的人，不要和他来 往。”等到曹丘生回去时，要窦长君写封介绍信好去见季布。窦长君说：“季将军不喜欢你，你不要去。”曹丘生坚持请窦长君写了，于是拿着信走了。窦长君先派人给季布送信，季布果然大为愤怒，等着曹丘生到来。曹丘生到了，马上向季布长揖行礼说： “楚人有句谚语说‘得到黄金一百，不如得到季布一句允诺。”您凭什么能在梁国、楚国一带获得这样的名声呢?况且我是楚国人，您也是楚国人。我周游天下到处宣扬您的大名，您却这样不重视我吗?您拒绝我怎么这么远呢!”季布于是十分高兴，把他请了进去，留住了几个月，待为贵宾，临走时又送他一份厚礼。季布的名声之所以更大，就是曹丘生替他宣传的。

季布的弟弟季心，勇气和胆略在关中最有名，待人恭敬谨慎，行侠仗义，方圆数千里之内，士人都争着为他尽力效死。他曾经杀了人，逃亡到吴国，躲在袁丝家里。他以服侍长辈之礼对待袁丝，像对待弟弟一样照顾灌夫、籍福等人。他曾经担任过中司马，中尉郅都也不敢不礼遇他。年轻人很多常常假冒他的名义 在外行事。那个时候，季心以他的勇敢，季布以他的信用，闻名关中 。

季布的舅舅丁公，是楚王项羽的将领。丁公曾经为项羽率军 追困高祖于彭城之西，短兵相接，高祖危急，回头对丁公说：“两个贤能的人何必相互残害呢!”于是丁公带兵返回，汉王才得以脱险 而去。等项王被消灭，丁公去拜见高祖。高祖将丁公在军营中示众， 说：“丁公身为项王的臣子而不忠于项王，使项王丧失天下的，正是丁公。”于是杀了丁公，说：“让后代做人臣子的不要效法丁公!

栾布，是梁国人。当初梁王彭越还是普通百姓的时候，曾与 栾布交往。栾布家里穷，到齐地做工，在一家酒店里当雇工。过了几年，彭越离家到巨野一带当了强盗，而栾布被人劫去卖掉， 在燕地当奴隶。栾布替他的主人报仇，燕国的将军臧荼推荐他做 了都尉。臧荼后来当了燕王，任用栾布为将军。到臧荼反叛时， 汉朝攻打燕国，俘虏了栾布。梁王彭越听说了这件事，就去请求皇上，赎回栾布让他做了梁国的大夫。

栾布奉命出使齐国，还没有回来，汉高祖召见彭越，指责他图谋反叛，将他父母、兄弟、妻子三族斩尽杀绝。行刑后又将彭越的头颅割下悬挂在洛阳城楼下，颁布诏令说：“有敢收殓或看望 彭越的头颅的，就把他抓起来。”栾布从齐国回来，到彭越的头 颅下面汇报，祭奠哭吊他。官吏抓住栾布向皇上报告。皇上召见栾布，骂道：“你参加彭越的造反了吗?我禁止人不得收殓或看望他，你偏偏跑去祭奠哭吊，分明是参与了彭越的造反。赶快烹杀 他!”正当把栾布提着奔向开水锅的时候，栾布回过头来说：“我还要说一句话再去死。”皇上说：“还要说什么?”栾布说：“当年 皇上被围困在彭城，在荥阳、成皋一带战败的时候，项王之所以 不能最终向西追击，只是由于彭王在梁地，与汉军联合牵制楚军的缘故。在那个时候，彭王一回头，帮楚则汉败，帮汉则楚败。 况且垓下会战，不是彭王参战，项氏也不会灭亡。天下平定以后，彭王接过玺印接受分封，也希望能够万代相传。现在陛下一声令下到梁国征调军队，彭王因重病不能随行，而陛下就怀疑是要造反，造反的证据也没看到，就以琐细的事情为罪名把他杀了，我担心功臣会人人自危了。现在彭王已经死了，我活着还不如死了，请把我扔进开水锅吧。”于是皇上便赦免了栾布的罪，拜任他为都尉。

孝文帝的时候，栾布任燕相，官至将军。栾布声称：“贫穷困顿的时候不能忍辱求全，就不是一个真正的人；富贵以后不能实现自己的意愿，就不是一个贤能的人。”于是对那些曾于他有恩的人都厚厚地报答人家，对那些有仇的人都一定藉法律杀掉。吴、楚七国反叛时，栾布以战功受封为俞侯，又作了燕国的国相。在燕、齐一带许多地方都为栾布建造祠堂，称之为 “栾公社”。孝景帝中元五年(公元前145年),栾布去世。他的儿子栾贲继承侯位，担任太常，后来因为祭祀时所用的祭品牲畜不合规定，封国被撤销。

太史公说：以项羽那样的气概，而季布却能够凭勇敢闻名于楚国，多次亲身踏灭敌军夺得军旗，真可以称得上是壮士。但到被施以刑罚，做了人家的奴隶却仍然不肯一死，又是何等的卑下啊!他一定是自负自己有才干，因此虽然受到侮辱却并不感到羞耻，是希望找到地方施展自己尚未施展的抱负啊，所以他终于成为汉朝的名将。贤能的人的确很看重自己的生命。那些婢女、小妾、微贱的人因怨愤而自杀的，并不是勇敢，是他们没有什么计划要实践罢了。栾布哭吊彭越，走向开水锅就如同是回家，那是他的确知道自己的处境，已经不再畏惧一死了。即使是古代的有志有节之人，又怎么能超过他呢!</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Ji Bu was a man of Chu, where he was well-known for his gal- lantry and spirit. Made a general by Xiang Yu, he worsted the king of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.) on several occasions. After Xiang Yu perished, the emperor offered a reward of a thousand gold pieces for his capture, threatening anyone who dared to shelter him with the destruction of three classes of their relatives. Ji Bu took refuge in Puyang with a man named Zhou, who told him, ‘The emperor is searching hard for you, general, and will soon trace you here. If you are willing to take my advice, I shall venture to propose a plan. If not, I had better kill myself.” Ji Bu agreed to his plan and let himself be shaved and dressed in coarse clothes, with an iron chain round his neck. Then he was sent in a covered wagon with several dozen slaves to be sold to Zhu Jia in Lu..Zhu Jia, knowing that this was Ji Bu, bought him and set him to work on his farm. He instructed his son, “You must farm as this slave says and share your meals with him.” Then he went by a one-horse carriage to Luoyang to see Xiahou Ying, marquis of Ruyin and Lord Teng. The latter entertained him for several days, and Zhu Jia found an opportunity to ask, “What is Ji Bu's great crime that the emperor is searching so hard for him?”

“Ji Bu often had him on the spot when he was fighting for Xiang Yu,” replied Lord Teng. “The emperor bears him such a grudge that he has set his heart on capturing him.” “What is your opinion of Ji Bu?”“An able man.” “Every subject serves his own master. Ji Bu, servingXiang Yu, was doing no more than his duty. Does the emperor mean to kill all Xiang Yu's followers? The empire is newly won and if the emperor hounds one man on account of a private grudge, how narrow-minded the world is going to think him! Besides, if Ji Bu is an able man and the emperor hounds him like this, he will escape north to the Huns or south to the Yues. Goading a good man into helping an enemy state was what made Wu Zixu whip the grave of the king of Chu. Might you mention this to the emperor if an occasion arises?” Lord Teng knew that ZhuJia was noble-minded and guessed that Ji Bu was hiding with him, so he agreed. Later he found occasion to speak to the emperor as ZhuJia had suggested, and Ji Bu was pardoned. Ji Bu won general approval at the time for the way he adapted himself to circumstances, while Zhu Jia made a name. for himself on this account too. Ji Bu was summoned to court, where he apologized to the emperor and was appointed an imperial guardsman.

During the reign of Emperor Hui,while Ji Bu was captain of the imperial guards,the Hunnish khan sent a coarse and insulting letter to Empress Lü.In a rage,she summoned the generals for a consultation.Fan Kuai the high marshal said,“Give me a hundred thousand men and the Huns will scatter before me."Other generals,to please the empress,expressed approval.But Ji Bu said,"Fan Kuai deserves to lose his head.The First Emperor,with more than four hundred thousand men,was neverthe- less surrounded at Pingcheng.Now Fan Kuai with a hundred thousand will make the Huns scatter before him.Abare-faced lie!Besides,it was Qin's campaigns against the Huns that enabled Chen She and the rest to start a rebellion.The country has not yet recovered from the ravages of war,but Fan Kuai is flattering you to stir up fresh trouble for the empire.”The whole court was aghast.Empress Lü dismissed the generals, and no more was said about attacking the Huns.

In the reign of Emperor Wen,when JiBu was governor of Hedong, someone recommended him to the emperor,who summoned him to the capital with the intention of making him a chief counsellor.Then, however,it was reported that he was reckless,headstrong when in his cups,and hard to deal with.So after his arrival he was lodged in a government hostel for a month and then dismissed.839When he went to take his leave of the emperor,he said,"For no merit of mine,I was favoured with the governorship of Hedong,then received an unexpected summons to court,due no doubt to an unwarranted recommendation. Since my arrival, however, I have been given no new appointment but dismissed, due no doubt to some detractor. Apparently Your Majesty summoned me on one man's recommenda- tion and dismissed me because another spoke ill of me. I fear that all intelligent men who hear this will know how to judge you, sir.” After a long, embarrassed silence the emperor said, “Hedong is a vital province in my eyes. That is why I sent for you.” Then Ji Bu returned to his post.

An orator of Chu known as Master Caoqiu relied on influential connections to make money. He undertook certain tasks for Zhao Tong and other high officials, and was on good terms with Empress Jing's uncle, Dou Changjun. When Ji Bu knew this he wrote to warn Lord Dou, “I hear bad reports of Caoqiu Sheng. Better have nothing to do with the man!”As Caoqiu Sheng was about to return to Chu, he asked Lord Dou for a letter of introduction to Ji Bu.“General Ji has taken a dislike to you,” said Lord Dou. "I advise you to steer clear of him.”But Caoqiu insisted on going. The letter of introduction was sent on ahead and, sure enough, Ji Bu was very angry as he waited for the orator.Caoqiu, arriving, bowed to Ji Bu and said, ‘The men of Chu have a saying, ‘A promise from Ji Bu is worth more than a hundred catties of gold.' How did you make such a name for yourself in Liang and Chu? I am a native of Chu and so are you. Have I not done much to spread your fame through the world? Why should you be so preju- diced against me?” Ji Bu was very pleased. He invited Caoqiu in and kept him for several months as his honoured guest, loading him with rich gifts when he left. It was indeed Caoqiu who helped to spread Ji Bu's fame.

Ji Bu's younger brother Ji Xin was so renowned within the Pass for his courtesy and chivalry that gentlemen for a thousand liaround would risk their lives for him. Once he killed a man and fled to Wu to take refuge with Yuan Si. He treated Yuan Si as his senior and men like Guan Fu and Ji Fu as his juniors. When he served as major to the metropolitan commander Zhi Du, the latter had to show him respect. Many young men went about doing things in his name. For at that time Ji Xin's courage and Ji Bu’s integrity were famed throughout the area within the Pass.

Ji Bu's maternal uncle, Lord Ding, was a general of Chu who had served under Xiang Yu and driven the Han emperor west of Pengcheng, where the two of them crossed swords. The emperor in desperation had turned to ask him, “Why should two good men harass each other like this?” Then Lord Ding led his forces back, allowing the emperor to escape. After Xiang Yu had been destroyed Lord Ding went to see the emperor, who denounced him publicly before the army. “Lord Ding was disloyal to Xiang Yu,” he said. “It was he who lost Xiang Yu his empire.”He had him beheaded and warned, “Let no subject henceforward follow Lord Ding's example!”

Luan Bu was a man of Liang who befriended Peng Yue, king of Liang, when he was still a common citizen. Being hard pressed for money, they worked as hired hands in Qi and as waiters in a tavern. Some years later Peng Yue became a brigand in the Juye Marshes, but Luan Bu was captured and sold as a slave in Yan. Subsequently he avenged his master's death and General Zang Tu of Yan made him a commander. After Zang Tu became king of Yan, he made Luan Bu a general. When Zang Tu revolted, the army of Han attacked Yan and Luan Bu was captured. News of this reached PengYue, then king of Liang, who interceded with the emperor for Luan Bu's release and made him one of his ministers.

Luan Bu was sent as an envoy to Qi, but before his return the emperor summoned Peng Yue to court, accused him of treason and wiped out all his kinsmen. Peng Yue's head was displayed on the gate Luoyang with the warning:“The watch shall arrest any man who dares remove this head!”When Luan Bu came back from Qi,he reported on his mission to Peng Yue's head,sacrificed to it and mourned.The officers arrested him and reported the matter to the emperor,who sent for Luan Bu and swore at him,"Were you involved in Peng Yue's revolt?I gave orders that his head was not to be taken down,yet you sacrificed to it and mourned him.It is obvious that you plotted treason with him. Throw this fellow into the cauldron!”As Luan Bu was being dragged to the cauldron,he looked over his shoulder and called,"I beg to say one word before I die!""What is it?"demanded the emperor."When Your Majesty was hard pressed at Pengcheng and lost a battle between Xingyang and Chenggao,Xiang Yu could not advance further west because Peng Yue was harassing him for you in Liang.All depended on Peng Yue then.Had he gone over to Chu,Han would have been beaten.By aiding Han,he brought about Chu's defeat.If not for his help at Gaixia,you could not have destroyed Xiang Yu.“After the empire was secure,Peng Yue received a tally and a fief, and expected to hand them down to his heirs for countless generations. Then you summoned his army from Liang and,just because he was too illto come,suspected that he had rebelled.With no real evidence, you executed him on a flimsy pretext.All your other worthy subjectsmust fear for their lives.Now that he has been killed;I would rather die than live. Lead me to the cauldron!”The emperor pardoned him and made him a commander.

During the revolt of the prince of Wu he distinguished himself in battle and was enfeoffed as marquis of Yu, after which he served as Yan's prime minister again. The people of Yan and Qi instituted temple sacrifices for him, calling him Lord Luan. He died in the fifth year of the middle era of Emperor Jing.' His son Fen who succeeded to his title was a master of ceremony, but he was deprived of his fief for sacrificing in a way contrary to government orders.

The Grand Historian comments: Thanks to Xiang Yu, Ji Bu became known for his courage in Chu. On several occasions at the head of his troops he captured the enemy flag. He was a brave warrior. Yet when humiliated and sold as a slave he suffered meekly and did not kill himself. He must have had such confidence in his own ability that he endured disgrace without shame, determined to fulfil his ambitions later. So finally he became a great general of Han. A great man will not ‘ die in vain. When slave girls and concubines kill themselves in a passion, this is not because they are brave but because they have no way out.Luan Bu mourned for Peng Yue and courted death in the cauldron because he knew where he stood, and therefore did not set great store on his life. Even the heroes of old could have done no more.</div>
