          <div class="txt">吕不韦者，阳翟大贾人也。往来贩贱卖贵，家累千金。

秦昭王四十年，太子死。其四十二年，以其次子安国君为太子。安国君有子二十余人。安国君有所甚爱姬，立以为正夫人，号曰华阳夫人。华阳夫人无子。安国君中男名子楚，子楚母曰夏姬，毋爱。子楚为秦质子于赵。秦数攻赵，赵不甚礼子楚。

子楚，秦诸庶孽孙，质于诸侯，车乘进用不饶，居处困，不得意。吕不韦贾邯郸，见而怜之，曰 “此奇货可居也”。乃往见子楚，说曰：“吾能大子之门。” 子楚笑曰：“且自大君之门，而乃大吾门！” 吕不韦曰：“子不知也，吾门待子门而大。” 子楚心知所谓，乃引与坐，深语。吕不韦曰：“秦王老矣，安国君得为太子。窃闻安国君爱幸华阳夫人，华阳夫人无子，能立適嗣者独华阳夫人耳。今子兄弟二十余人，子又居中，不甚见幸，久质诸侯。即大王薨，安国君立为王，则子毋几得与长子及诸子旦暮在前者争为太子矣。” 子楚曰：“然。为之奈何？” 吕不韦曰：“子贫，客于此，非有以奉献于亲及结宾客也。不韦虽贫，请以千金为子西游，事安国君及华阳夫人，立子为適嗣。” 子楚乃顿首曰：“必如君策，请得分秦国与君共之。”

吕不韦乃以五百金与子楚，为进用，结宾客；而复以五百金买奇物玩好，自奉而西游秦，求见华阳夫人姊，而皆以其物献华阳夫人。因言子楚贤智，结诸侯宾客遍天下，常曰 “楚也以夫人为天，日夜泣思太子及夫人”。夫人大喜。不韦因使其姊说夫人曰:“吾闻之，以色事人者，色衰而爱弛。今夫人事太子，甚爱而无子，不以此时蚤自结于诸子中贤孝者，举立以为適而子之，夫在则重尊，夫百岁之后，所子者为王，终不失势，此所谓一言而万世之利也。不以繁华时树本，即色衰爱弛后，虽欲开一语，尚可得乎？今子楚贤，而自知中男也，次不得为適，其母又不得幸，自附夫人，夫人诚以此时拔以为適，夫人则竟世有宠于秦矣。” 华阳夫人以为然，承太子闲，从容言子楚质于赵者绝贤，来往者皆称誉之。乃因涕泣曰：“妾幸得充后宫，不幸无子，愿得子楚立以为適嗣，以托妾身。” 安国君许之，乃与夫人刻玉符，约以为適嗣。安国君及夫人因厚馈遗子楚，而请吕不韦傅之，子楚以此名誉益盛于诸侯。

吕不韦取邯郸诸姬绝好善舞者与居，知有身。子楚从不韦饮，见而说之，因起为寿，请之。吕不韦怒，念业已破家为子楚，欲以钓奇，乃遂献其姬。姬自匿有身，至大期时，生子政。子楚遂立姬为夫人。

秦昭王五十年，使王崎围邯郸，急，赵欲杀子楚。子楚与吕不韦谋，行金六百斤予守者吏，得脱，亡赴秦军，遂以得归。赵欲杀子楚妻子，子楚夫人，赵豪家女也，得匿，以故母子竟得活。秦昭王五十六年，薨，太子安国君立为王，华阳夫人为王后，子楚为太子。赵亦奉子楚夫人及子政归秦。

秦王立一年，薨，谥为孝文王。太子子楚代立，是为庄襄王。庄襄王所母华阳后为华阳太后，真母夏姬尊以为夏太后。庄襄王元年，以吕不韦为丞相，封为文信侯，食河南雒阳十万户。

庄襄王即位三年，薨，太子政立为王，尊吕不韦为相国，号称“仲父”。秦王年少，太后时时窃私通吕不韦。不韦家僮万人。

当是时，魏有信陵君，楚有春申君，赵有平原君，齐有孟尝君，皆下士喜宾客以相倾。吕不韦以秦之强，羞不如，亦招致士，厚遇之，至食客三千人。是时诸侯多辩士，如荀卿之徒，著书布天下。吕不韦乃使其客人人著所闻，集论以为八览、六论、十二纪，二十余万言。以为备天地万物古今之事，号曰《吕氏春秋》。布咸阳市门，悬千金其上，延诸侯游士宾客有能增损一字者予千金。

始皇帝益壮，太后淫不止。吕不韦恐觉祸及己，乃私求大阴人嫪毒以为舍人，时纵倡乐，使以其阴关桐轮而行，令太后闻之，以啗太后。太后闻，果欲私得之。吕不韦乃进嫪毒，诈令人以腐罪告之。不韦又阴谓太后曰：“可事诈腐，则得给事中。”太后乃阴厚赐主腐者吏，诈论之，拔其须眉为宦者，遂得侍太后。太后私与通，绝爱之。有身，太后恐人知之，诈卜当避时，徙宫居雍。嫪毒常从，赏赐甚厚，事皆决于嫪毒。嫪毒家僮数千人，诸客求宦为嫪舍人千余人。

始皇七年，庄襄王母夏太后薨。孝文王后曰华阳太后，与孝文王会葬寿陵。夏太后子庄襄王葬芷阳，故夏太后独别葬杜东，曰“东望吾子，西望吾夫。后百年，旁当有万家邑”。

始皇九年，有告嫪毒实非宦者，常与太后私乱，生子二人，皆匿之。与太后谋曰：“王即薨，以子为后”。于是秦王下吏治，具得情实，事连相国吕不韦。九月，夷嫪毒三族，杀太后所生两子，而遂迁太后于雍。诸嫪舍人皆没其家而迁之蜀。王欲诛相国，为其奉先王功大，及宾客辩士为游说者众，王不忍致法。

秦王十年十月，免相国吕不韦。及齐人茅焦说秦王，秦王乃迎太后于雍，归复咸阳，而出文信侯就国河南。

岁余，诸侯宾客使者相望于道，请文信侯。秦王恐其为变，乃赐文信侯书曰：“君何功于秦？秦封君河南，食十万户。君何亲于秦？号称仲父。其与家属徙处蜀！”吕不韦自度稍侵，恐诛，乃饮鸩而死。秦王所加怒吕不韦、嫪毒皆已死，乃皆复归嫪毒舍人迁蜀者。

始皇十九年，太后薨，谥为帝太后，与庄襄王会葬芷阳。

太史公曰：不韦及嫪毒贵，封号文信侯。人之告嫪毒，嫪毒闻之。秦王验左右，未发。王之雍郊，恐祸起，乃与党谋，矫太后玺发卒以反蕲年宫。王知之，发吏攻毒，毒败亡走，追斩之好畤，遂灭其宗。而吕不韦由此绌矣。孔子之所谓“闻”者，其吕子乎？</div>

          <div class="txt">吕不韦是韩国阳翟的一个大商人。到处贱买贵卖地做买卖，以至于使家中积蓄了千金的财富。

秦昭王四十年，太子病故。秦昭王四十二年，立他的第二个儿子安国君做了太子。而安国君这时已经是有二十多个儿子的父亲了。他有个最喜爱的小老婆，后来把她立为正夫人，人称华阳夫人。而华阳夫人偏偏没有儿子。安国君有个排行居中的儿子叫子楚，子楚的母亲叫夏姬，不被安国君宠爱，因而子楚被秦国送到赵国去做人质。后来由于秦国又屡次进攻赵国，所以赵国对子楚很不尊重。

由于子楚本来就不是秦王的正根，再加上是在国外做人质，因而他的车马用度都不富裕，日常生活很困难，心中闷闷不乐。这时吕不韦正好到邯郸做生意，他一见子楚的样子，对他很可怜，心想：“这倒是件奇货，值得收藏。” 于是就去见子楚说：“我能让您的门庭光大。” 子楚见他是个商人，不由得笑了，说：“还是先去光大你自己的门庭吧，配说什么光大我的门庭！" 吕不韦说：“我的门庭得靠着您门庭的光大而光大。” 子楚明白了吕不韦说话的意思，于是就请他坐下，和他进一步地进行了交谈。吕不韦说：“秦王已经老了，安国君现在是太子。我听说安国君宠爱华阳夫人，华阳夫人没有儿子。而能够为安国君树立接班人的又只有华阳夫人。如今您的兄弟有二十多个，您又排行居中，不怎么受宠爱，长久地在国外当人质。等到某一天秦王去世，安国君即位为王，到那时您就不可能去同您的长兄和那些朝夕在安国君面前的弟兄们去争太子的位置了。” 子楚说：“是的。那怎么办呢？” 吕不韦说：“您本来就穷，又是在赵国做客，您当然拿不出什么东西去孝敬您的父母和结交宾客了。我虽然也不富裕，但我可以带着千金替您到你们国家去向安国君和华阳夫人进行活动，想法让他们立您为接班人。” 子楚一听立即向吕不韦叩头说：“如果真能实现您的计划，我愿意把秦国分一半给您。”

于是吕不韦就拿出五百金给了子楚，作为他的日常生活以及结交宾客之用；又用了五百金买了一批奇珍异宝，自己带着到了秦国。他先找到了华阳夫人的姐姐，托她把那些珍宝送给了华阳夫人，并顺便说了些子楚如何贤能智慧，已经结交了各个国家的许多宾客等等。并说子楚经常对人们说，他爱戴华阳夫人就像爱戴老天爷一样，他不分白天黑夜，只要一想到太子和夫人就哭。华阳夫人听了非常高兴。吕不韦又乘势请华阳夫人的姐姐劝华阳夫人说：“俗话说，靠着美貌侍候人的，等到一老就会失宠。现在太子虽然特别喜欢你，可是你没有儿子，你为什么不在这时及早在那些公子中挑一个贤能孝顺的，把他认为儿子立为接班人呢？这样，你丈夫在世时，你的地位可以更加尊贵；你丈夫去世后，是你所认的儿子继位为王，你的权势也不会消失，这不是说一句话就可以得到永久性的利益吗？你不趁着风华正茂的时候为自己立下根基，等到年老失宠时，即使再想说话，还会有人听吗？现在子楚为人不错，自己又知道排行居中，按次序也轮不到他，他的母亲也不受宠幸，所以他愿意来归附你。你如果能趁此时机认他为子，立他为接班人，那么你这辈子就会在秦国永远受宠了。” 华阳夫人觉得有理，于是就找机会，自然地对安国君讲起了在赵国当人质的子楚的事情，说子楚为人非常好，说来往于秦、赵两国之间的人们都称赞他。说着说着，华阳夫人又哭了起来，说：“我很幸运能够进了您的后宫，可是我非常不幸的是没有儿子，我现在想把子楚认为儿子，让他做您的接班人，这样也可以让我终身有靠。” 安国君答应了，于是给华阳夫人刻了玉符，约定将子楚立为接班人。接着安国君和华阳夫人派人送给了子楚许多东西，并请吕不韦去调护辅导他，从此子楚在各国之间的名声就越来越大了。

后来吕不韦在邯郸娶了一个美貌而又善舞的女子，不久这个女子怀孕了。这时有一天，子楚到吕不韦家来喝酒，看到这个女子很喜欢她，于是就起身向吕不韦敬酒，请求吕不韦把这个女子给他。吕不韦开始很生气，但后来一想，自己为了子楚连家产都快变卖光了，现在难道还能舍不得一个女子吗？再说他也想通过这个女子作诱饵钓一条大鱼，于是就把这个女子给了子楚。这个女子也故意隐瞒了她已经怀孕的事实，这样过了十二个月，她生了一个儿子，取名为政。于是子楚把这个女子立为夫人。

秦昭王五十年，派王崎带兵包围了邯郸，赵国的形势紧急，想杀子楚。子楚和吕不韦商量后，花了六百斤金子给监守他的小吏，因而得以脱身，逃到了秦国的军队中，终于回到了秦国。这时赵国想杀掉子楚的夫人和儿子，子楚夫人本来是赵国一家豪富的女儿，就跑到娘家藏了起来，最后母子俩都脱险了。秦昭王五十六年，昭王去世了，太子安国君继位为王，华阳夫人当了王后，子楚成了太子。这时赵国也只好把子楚夫人及她的儿子政送到了秦国。

安国君只做了一年秦王就去世了，被谥为孝文王。太子子楚继承了王位，这就是历史上所说的庄襄王。庄襄王所认的母亲华阳王后被称为华阳太后，他的亲生母亲夏姬被尊为夏太后。庄襄王元年，任吕不韦为丞相，并封之为文信侯，把河南雒阳一带的十万户封给他作为领地。

庄襄王在位三年去世，太子政也就是后来的秦始皇继立为王，他又尊吕不韦为相国，恭敬地称他为“仲父”。当时秦始皇年纪小，太后还经常与吕不韦私通。吕不韦家里的奴仆多达上万人。

这时候，魏国有信陵君，楚国有春申君，赵国有平原君，齐国有孟尝君，都是以礼贤下士、招纳宾客相竞争。吕不韦觉得秦国有如此之强的实力，在这方面也不能比别国差，于是也招纳士人，优礼相待，于是他门下的食客竟达到了三千多。当时其他国家有许多善辩的学者，如荀况等人，他们的著作都是四海皆知。吕不韦见此光景，也让他的宾客们人人动笔，把自己知道的事情都写出来，他把这些论著编辑成了八览、六论、十二纪，共二十多万字。他认为天地之间、古往今来的万事万物在这部书里无所不包，所以称之为《吕氏春秋》。他把这部书公布在咸阳市场的大门上，并在上面悬赏千金，邀请各国的游士宾客们来看，说是谁能够给这部书增加或删掉一个字，就把这千金送给他。

后来秦始皇的年龄越来越大了，而太后还是不停地跟吕不韦私通。吕不韦害怕事情给秦始皇发现自己遭殃，于是就暗中找到了一个生殖器特别粗大的名叫嫪毒的男人，做他的门客，吕不韦每当在家里举行歌舞杂技表演的时候，就让嫪毒用阴茎挑着一个桐木做的车轮子当众行走，并有意地让太后听说这件事，以引诱太后。太后听说后，果然想暗中得到嫪毒。于是吕不韦就把嫪毒送给了太后，同时又假意让人控告了嫪毒一个应受宫刑的罪。而后吕不韦又暗中告诉太后说：“先假装给他来个宫刑，而后就可以让他在宫内服侍你了。”于是太后就暗中赏给了主管动刑的人许多东西，让他们假装给嫪毒施了刑，给嫪毒拔去了胡子、眉毛，使他成了一个太监的样子，然后就让他去伺候太后。太后和嫪毒私通后，对他非常喜欢。很快地就怀了孕，太后为了怕人知道，就谎称从占卜中得知应该离开宫廷到外地躲避一段时间。就这样她搬到雍县的离宫中去住了。嫪毒经常跟着太后，得到的赏赐很多，国家的许多事情都是嫪毒说了算。嫪毒家里的奴仆达到几千人，那些找到门上想为嫪毒当舍人的宾客也有上千个。

秦始皇七年，庄襄王的母亲夏太后死了。因为在此以前孝文王的王后华阳太后已经和孝文王合葬在寿陵，而夏太后的儿子庄襄王是葬在芷阳，因此夏太后生前就告诉人们，叫人们等她死后把她单独地埋葬在杜县城东，她说“这样向东可以看到儿子，向西可以看到丈夫，而且这个地方百年以后将会形成一个有万户住家的城市”。

秦始皇九年，有人告发嫪毒不是一个真正的太监，说他经常跟太后私通，已经生了两个儿子，都在某个地方藏着。还说嫪毒已经和太后商量定了，等到大王死后，就让他们的孩子为王。秦始皇一听就把嫪毒下了狱。经过审问，了解了实情，事情牵连到了相国吕不韦。当年九月，秦始皇下令诛灭了嫪毒的三族，并杀掉了他跟太后所生的两个儿子，而把太后放逐到了雍县的离宫去居住。所有嫪毒的门客都一律被抄没家产流放到蜀地。秦始皇也想杀掉吕不韦，但因为他侍候先王的功劳较大，此外还有许多宾客辩士为他说情，所以秦始皇也就不忍心再杀他了。

秦始皇十年十月，免去了相国吕不韦的职位。后来齐国人茅焦劝说秦始皇，秦始皇才到雍县把太后接回了咸阳，而同时下令让吕不韦到他河南的封地上去住。

在这以后的一年多里，各国的宾客使者们络绎不绝地到河南封地上去拜会吕不韦。秦始皇怕吕不韦再闹乱子，于是给他写了一封信说：“你对秦国有什么功劳，以至于享用着河南的封地十万户？你跟秦国有什么亲缘？以至于被称为仲父。你要带着你的家属都给我搬到蜀地去！”吕不韦考虑着自己这样受逼迫越来越紧，最后可能要被砍头，于是就自已喝毒酒死了。秦始皇一见他所恨的吕不韦和嫪毒都已经死了，于是就下令放回了那些被流放到蜀地去的嫪毒的门客。

秦始皇十九年，太后去世，被谥为帝太后，跟庄襄王一同合葬在了芷阳。

太史公说：吕不韦和嫪毒显贵时，被封为文信侯。当有人告发嫪毒，嫪毒很快就知道了。秦始皇先是悄悄地审问了一些太后与嫪毒周围的人，还没有对嫪毒动手，就到雍县祭天去了。这时嫪毒害怕秦始皇回来大祸难免，于是就和他的党羽们商量，盗盖了太后的印玺，假传太后的命令发兵在蕲年宫叛乱。秦始皇闻讯后，派兵讨伐嫪毒，嫪毒被打败逃走了，秦始皇的人追到好畤，杀掉了嫪毒，又灭了他的满门。而吕不韦从此也就跟着失势了。孔子在《论语》中曾说过一种名声不小而行为很坏的所谓“闻人”，吕不韦大概就是属于这一种吧！</div>

          <div class="txt">Lü Buwei was a great merchant of Yangdi who, by travelling here and there, buying cheap and selling dear, had accumulated a fortune amounting to thousands in gold.

In the fortieth year of the reign of King Zhaoxiang of Qin (267 BC), the crown prince died, and two years later, in the forty-second year of his reign, the king designated his second son, Lord Anguo, as crown prince. Lord Anguo had over twenty sons. He had a concubine of whom he was extremely fond and whom he had designated as his consort with the title of Lady Huayang, but she had borne him no sons. By another concubine, of the Xia family, who no longer enjoyed his favour he had a son named Zichu, one of the younger among his twenty or more sons. Zichu had been sent by the state of Qin to be a hostage at the court of Zhao, and since, in spite of this, Qin had several times invaded Zhao, the Zhao court accordingly treated Zichu with scant respect.

Being merely a grandson of the king of Qin and the son of a concubine, and having been sent as hostage to one of the other feudal states, Zichu was poorly provided with carriages and other equipment and had to live in straightened circumstances, unable to do as he pleased. Lü Buwei, visiting Handan, the capital of Zhao, on business, saw him and was moved to pity. “Here is a rare piece of goods to put in my warehouse!” he exclaimed. He then went and called on Zichu, remarking, “I know how to enlarge your gate for you!” Zichu laughed and said, “You’d better enlarge your own gate before you worry about mine!” “You don’t understand,” said Lü Buwei. “The enlarging of my gate depends on the enlarging of yours!” Zichu, guessing what was in his mind, led him to a seat in an inner room and the two were soon deep in conversation. “The king of Qin is old and Lord Anguo has been designated crown prince,” Lü Buwei said. “I am told that Lord Anguo is very much in love with Lady Huayang, and since she has no son of her own, it will be up to her alone to decide which son shall be appointed as the rightful heir. Now you have twenty or more brothers, and from the point of view of age, you are about halfway down the line. You enjoy no particular favour and have been a hostage at the court of one of the other feudal lords for a long time. If your grandfather, the old king, should pass away and Lord Anguo become king, I’m afraid you would have little chance of competing for the position of crown prince with your elder brothers or with your other brothers who are there in person morning and evening to wait upon your father.” “True,” said Zichu. “But what can I do about it?” Lü Buwei said, “You are poor and living in a foreign land. You have nothing to use as gifts to present to the members of your family or to attract a band of followers about you. I too am poor, but with your permission I would like to take a thousand measures of gold and travel west on your behalf to Qin, where I will wait upon Lord Anguo and Lady Huayang and see to it that you are made the rightful heir.” Zichu bowed his head and said, “If indeed it should turn out as you say, when the day comes I hope you will allow me to divide the state of Qin and share it with you !”

Lü Buwei accordingly took 500 measures of gold and presented it to Zichu to be used as expense money in attracting a band of followers, and with another 500 he purchased various rare objects, trinkets, and toys, which he took with him west on a trip to Qin. There he sought an interview with the elder sister of Lady Huayang and asked that the gifts he had brought be presented to Lady Huayang. He took the opportunity to mention how virtuous and wise Zichu was, how he had friends among the followers of the various feudal lords all over the world, how he was constantly heard to exclaim, “Her Ladyship is as precious as Heaven itself to me!”, and how he wept day and night with longing for his father, the crown prince, and Lady Huayang. Lady Huayang was very pleased with this message. Lü Buwei then persuaded the elder sister to speak to Lady Huayang to this effect: “They say that one who has only beauty to offer a man will find, as beauty fades, that his love grows cold. Now you wait upon the crown prince but, though he loves you dearly, you have no son. Before it is too late, should you not take this opportunity to choose one of his sons whom you deem worthy and befriend him, seeing to it that he is elevated to the position of rightful heir and treating him as your own son? Then, as long as your husband lives, you will enjoy honour; and when his hundred years of life are ended and the one whom you call son becomes king, you need never fear any loss of position. This is what they call ‘speaking one word that brings ten thousand years of gain.’ But if now in blossom time you do not make certain that your roots are firm, then when beauty has faded and love grown cold, though you might hope for a chance to ‘speak one word’, how could you gain a hearing? Now Zichu is a worthy man and, being far down the line, knows that he cannot hope to become heir by the normal order of succession. In addition, his mother enjoys no favour, and so he offers all his devotion to you. If you were truly willingly to use this moment to pluck him from the line of succession and make him the heir, then to the end of your days you would enjoy favour in the state of Qin!” Lady Huayang, convinced of the truth of this argument, waited until her husband, the crown prince, was at leisure and then casually mentioned that Zichu, who had been sent as hostage to Zhao, was a man of outstanding worth and that everyone coming from abroad praised him highly. Then, with tears in her eyes, she said, “I have been fortunate enough to be assigned to your women’s quarters, but not so fortunate as to bear a son. I beg you to give me Zichu for a son and to set him up as the rightful heir so that I may have someone to entrust my fate to!” Lord Anguo gave his consent and had a jade tally engraved to this effect which he divided with Lady Huayang, promising that he would make Zichu his rightful heir. Then Lord Auguo and Lady Huayang sent rich gifts to Zichu and asked Lü Buwei to act as his tutor. As a result, Zichu became increasingly renowned among the feudal lords.

Lü Buwei had selected from among the ladies of Handan one of matchless beauty and great skill in dancing and had lived with her, and in time he learned that she was pregnant. Zichu, joining Lü Buwei in a drinking bout, happened to catch sight of her and was pleased. Immediately he stood up, proposed a toast to Lü’s long life, and asked if he might have her. Lü Buwei was outraged, but soon recalled that he had by now invested all of his family’s wealth in Zichu in hopes of fishing up some wonderful prize, and so in the end he presented the woman to him. She concealed the fact that she was pregnant, and when her time was up, she bore a son who was named Zheng. Zichu eventually made her his consort.

In the fiftieth year of his reign (257 BC) King Zhaoxiang of Qin sent Wang Yi to lay siege to Handan and, when the situation grew critical, the men of Zhao wanted to kill Zichu. Zichu and Lü Buwei plotted together, however, and distributed 600 catties of gold to the officers who were in charge of guarding them. In this way Zichu managed to escape, make his way to the Qin army, and eventually return home. The men of Zhao then proposed to kill Zichu’s wife and child, but because his wife was the daughter of a wealthy family in Zhao, she was able to go into hiding; thus both mother and son escaped alive. King Zhaoxiang of Qin passed away in the fifty-sixth year of his reign (251 BC). The crown prince, Lord Anguo, succeeded him as king, Lady Huayang became queen, and Zichu was made crown prince. The state of Zhao obliged by sending Zichu’s wife and son Zheng to their new home in Qin.

The king of Qin passed away after one year of rule and was given the posthumous title of King Xiaowen. The crown prince Zichu succeeded him and is known as King Zhuangxiang. Queen Huayang, whom King Zhuangxiang had come to treat as a mother, was given the title of Queen Dowager Huayang, and his real mother, whose family name was Xia, was called Queen Dowager Xia. In the first year of his reign (250 BC), King Zhuangxiang made Lü Buwei his chancellor and enfeoffed him as marquis of Wenxin with the revenue from 100,000 households in Henan and Luoyang.

King Zhuangxiang passed away after three years on the throne and the crown prince Zheng became king. He honoured Lü Buwei with the position of prime minister and as a mark of respect addressed him as Zhongfu or Uncle. The new king of Qin was still young and his mother, the former concubine of Lü Buwei, who had now become queen dowager, from time to time had sexual relations with Lü Buwei in secret. Lü Buwei had some 10,000 male servants in his household.

This was the period of Lord Xinling of Wei, Lord Chunshen of Chu, Lord Pingyuan of Zhao, and Lord Mengchang of Qi, all men who were willing to humble themselves before others and who delighted in gathering bands of followers about them, seeking in this way to outdo one another. Lü Buwei felt that, since Qin was a powerful state, it was disgraceful for it not to do likewise, and so he too set about attracting gentlemen to his service with offers of generous rewards and treatment, and in time gathered as many as 3,000 men who lived and ate at his expense. This was also the period when there were many skilled debaters in the various feudal states, men such as Xun Qing who wrote books and circulated them throughout the world. Lü Buwei accordingly ordered each of his retainers to write down what he himself had learned, and then collected and edited the results into a work comprising eight lan or “surveys”, six lun or “discussions”, and twelve ji or “records”, totalling over 20,000 characters. It was intended to embrace all the affairs of heaven, earth, the ten thousand things, yesterday, and today, and was entitled “The Spring and Autumn of Mr Lü.” The text was posted on the market gate of Xianyang, the Qin capital, with 1,000 pieces of gold suspended above it. An invitation to the wandering scholars and retainers of the various feudal lords informed them that the 1,000 in gold would be awarded to anyone who could add or subtract a single character from it.

The king of Qin, who was later to bear the title of First Emperor of the Qin, in time grew to manhood, but his mother, the queen dowager, did not cease her wanton behaviour. Lü Buwei began to fear that, if her conduct were ever brought to light, he himself would become involved in the scandal. He therefore searched about in secret until he found a man named Lao Ai who had an unusually large penis, and made him a servant in his household. Then, when an occasion arose, he had suggestive music performed and, instructing Lao Ai to stick his penis through the centre of a wheel made of paulownia wood, had him walk about with it, making certain that the report of this reached the ears of the queen dowager so as to excite her interest. She received the report and, as had been expected, wanted to have the man smuggled into her quarters. Lü Buwei then presented Lao Ai, at the same time getting someone to pretend to accuse him of a crime for which the punishment was castration. Lü Buwei spoke to the queen dowager in private, pointing out that, if the man were subjected to a mock castration, he could then be taken into service in the queen’s private apartments. The queen accordingly sent lavish gifts in secret to the official who was in charge of performing the castration, who then pretended to carry out the sentence, plucking out the man’s beard and eyebrows and making him into a “eunuch”. In this way he eventually came to wait on the queen, who carried on clandestine relations with him and grew to love him greatly. In time she became pregnant and, fearing discovery, pretended to conduct a divination that indicated that, in order to avoid a period of evil influences, she should move from the palace and take up residence in Yong. Lao Ai was constantly in attendance on her and received lavish gifts and awards. All decisions were made by Lao Ai, who was waited upon by an entourage of several thousand male servants. His followers numbered over 1,000, all men who flocked to him in hopes of attaining government office.

In the seventh year of the king’s reign (240 BC) Queen Dowager Xia, the mother of King Zhuangxiang, passed away. Earlier Queen Dowager Huayang, the queen of King Xiaowen, had been buried with her husband, King Xiaowen, at Shouling, and Queen Dowager Xia’s son, King Zhuangxiang, had been buried at Zhiyang. Accordingly, Queen Dowager Xia was buried separately at a spot east of Du where, in her words, “I may look eastward to my son and westward to my husband. After 100 years, a city of 10,000 households will surely grow up by my side.”

In the ninth year of the king’s reign someone reported that Lao Ai was not a real eunuch at all, but had constantly been engaging in secret misconduct with the queen dowager, and that she had borne him two sons, both of whom were being kept in hiding. “He and the queen dowager have agreed,” said the report, “that, when the present king passes on, one of these sons shall succeed him.” The king thereupon referred the matter to his officials for investigation and all the facts were brought to light, including those that implicated the prime minister Lü Buwei. In the ninth month Lao Ai and his three sets of relatives were executed, the two sons whom the queen dowager had borne were put to death, and the residence of the queen was officially transferred to Yong. Lao Ai’s followers were all deprived of their household goods and sent into exile in Shu. The king of Qin wanted to put the prime minister Lü Buwei to death as well but, because he had won great distinction in the service of the former king, and because so many followers and men of eloquence came forward to speak on his behalf, the king could not bring himself to apply the death penalty.

In the tenth month of the tenth year of his reign the king of Qin removed Lü Buwei from the office of prime minister. Later Mao Jiao, a man of Qi, spoke to the king of Qin and persuaded him to send to Yong for his mother, the queen dowager, and allow her to return to residence in Xianyang. The king also ordered Lü Buwei, the marquis of Wenxin, to leave the capital and proceed to his fief in Henan.

A year or so later he learned that so many of the followers and envoys of the various feudal lords were travelling to Henan to call on Lü Buwei that their carriages were never out of sight of each other on the road. Fearful that there might be some plot afoot, the king sent a letter to Lü Buwei saying, “What did you ever do for the state of Qin that Qin should enfeoff you in Henan with the revenue from a 100,000 households? What relation are you to the ruler of Qin that you should be addressed as ‘Uncle’? Be so good as to take your family and retinue and move your residence to Shu!” Lü Buwei judged that he would only have to suffer increasing insult and, fearing the death penalty, he drank poison and died. With Lü Buwei and Lao Ai, the two men who had been the butt of his anger, both dead, the king recalled Lao Ai’s retainers who had been exiled to Shu.

In the nineteenth year of his reign his mother, the queen dowager, passed away and was given the posthumous title of Empress Dowager. She was buried with her husband, King Zhuangxiang, at Zhiyang.

The Grand Historian remarks: Lü Buwei and Lao Ai were both honoured with fiefs, the former receiving the title of marquis of Wenxin. When accusations were first made against Lao Ai, Lao got word of it. The king of Qin questioned those about him as to the truth of the charges but had not yet uncovered any definite evidence when he set off for Yong to perform the suburban sacrifice. Lao Ai, fearful that calamity was about to befall him, plotted with the members of his clique and, using the queen dowager’s seal of authority without her permission, called out troops and initiated a revolt in the Qinian Palace. The king dispatched officers to attack Lao Ai’s forces and Lao Ai fled in defeat. He was pursued and cut down at Haozhi, and eventually his whole clan was wiped out. This marked the beginning of Lü Buwei’s fall from power. What Confucius said about the “man of fame” might well apply to this Master Lü, might it not?</div>
