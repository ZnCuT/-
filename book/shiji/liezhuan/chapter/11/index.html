          <h3>文言文</h3>
          <div class="txt">张廷尉释之者，堵阳人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾为骑 郎，事孝文帝，十岁不得调，无所知名。释之曰：“久宦减仲之 产，不遂。”欲自免归。中郎将袁盎知其贤，惜其去，乃请徙释 之补谒者。释之既朝毕，因前言便宜事。文帝曰：“卑之，毋甚高 论，令今可施行也。”于是释之言秦、汉之间事，秦所以失而汉 所以兴者，久之。文帝称善，乃拜释之为谒者仆射。

释之从行，登虎圈。上问上林尉诸禽兽簿，十余问，尉左右视，尽不能对。虎圈啬夫从旁代尉对上所问禽兽簿，甚悉。欲以观其能口对响应无穷者。文帝曰：“吏不当如是邪?尉无赖!”乃诏 释之拜啬夫为上林令。释之久之前曰：“陛下以绛侯周勃何如人 也?”上曰：“长者也。”又复问：“东阳侯张相如何如人也?”上复 曰：“长者。”释之曰：“夫绛侯、东阳侯称为长者，此两人言事， 曾不能出口，岂教此啬夫谍谍利口捷给哉!且秦以任刀笔之吏，吏 争以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，无恻隐之实。以故不闻其 过，陵迟而至于二世，天下土崩。今陛下以啬夫口辩而超迁之，臣 恐天下随风靡靡，争为口辩而无其实。且下之化上疾于景响，举错 不可不审也。”文帝曰：“善。”乃止不拜啬夫。

上就车，召释之参乘，徐行问释之秦之敝。具以质言。至宫， 上拜释之为公车令。

顷之，太子与梁王共车人朝，不下司马门，于是释之追止太子、梁王，无得入殿门。遂劾不下公门不敬，奏之。薄太后闻之， 文帝免冠谢曰：“教儿子不谨。”薄太后乃使使承诏赦太子、梁王，然后得入。文帝由是奇释之，拜为中大夫。顷之，至中郎将。从行至霸陵，居北临厕。是时慎夫人从，上 指示慎夫人新丰道，曰：“此走邯郸道也。”使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自 倚瑟而歌，意惨凄悲怀，顾谓群臣曰：“嗟乎!以北山石为椁，用紵絮斫陈，萦漆其间，岂可动哉!”左右皆曰:“善。”释之前进曰:“使其中有可欲者，虽锢南山犹有隙;使其中无可欲者，虽无石椁，又何戚焉!”文帝称善。其后拜释之为廷尉。

顷之，上行出中渭桥，有一人从桥下走出，乘舆马惊。于是使骑捕，属之廷尉。释之治问。曰:“县人来，闻跸，匿桥下。久之，以为行已过，即出，见乘舆车骑，即走耳。”廷尉奏当，一人犯跸，当罚金。文帝怒曰:“此人亲惊吾马，吾马赖柔和，令他马，固不败伤我乎?而廷尉乃当之罚金!”释之曰:“法者天子所与天下公共也。今法如此，而更重之，是法不信于民也。且方其时，上使立诛之则已。今既下廷尉，廷尉，天下之平也。一倾，而天下用法皆为轻重，民安所措其手足?唯陛下察之。”良久，上曰:“廷尉当是也。”

其后有人盗高庙坐前玉环，捕得，文帝怒，下廷尉治。释之案律盗宗庙服御物者为奏，奏当弃市。上大怒，曰:“人之无道，乃盗先帝庙器，吾属廷尉者，欲致之族，而君以法奏之，非吾所以共承宗庙意也。”释之免冠顿首谢曰:“法如是足也。且罪等，然以逆顺为差。今盗宗庙器而族之，有如万分之一，假令愚民取长陵一抔土，陛下何以加其法乎?”久之，文帝与太后言之，乃许廷尉当。是时，中尉条侯周亚夫与梁相山都侯王恬开见释之持议平，乃结为亲友。张廷尉由此天下称之。

后文帝崩，景帝立，释之恐，称病。欲免去，惧大诛至;欲见谢，则未知何如。用王生计，卒见谢，景帝不过也。

王生者，善为黄、老言，处士也。尝召居廷中，三公九卿尽会立，王生老人，曰“吾袜解”，顾谓张廷尉:“为我结袜!”释之跪而结之。既已，人或谓王生曰:“独奈何廷辱张廷尉。使跪结袜?”王生曰:“吾老且贱，自度终无益于张廷尉，张廷尉方今天下名臣，吾故聊辱廷尉使跪结袜，欲以重之。”诸公闻之，贤王生而重张廷尉。

张廷尉事景帝岁余，为淮南王相，犹尚以前过也。久之，释之卒。其子曰张挚，字长公，官至大夫，免。以不能取容当世，故终身不仕。

冯唐者，其大父赵人。父徙代。汉兴徙安陵。唐以孝著，为中郎署长，事文帝。文帝辇过，问唐曰:“父老何自为郎?家安在?”唐具以实对。文帝曰:“吾居代时，吾尚食监高祛数为我言赵将李齐之贤，战于钜鹿下。今吾每饭，意未尝不在钜鹿也。父知之乎?”唐对曰:“尚不如廉颇、李牧之为将也。”上曰:“何以?”唐曰:“臣大父在赵时，为官卒将，善李牧。臣父故为代相，善赵将李齐，知其为人也。”上既闻廉颇、李牧为人，良说，而搏髀曰:“嗟乎!吾独不得廉颇、李牧时为吾将，吾岂忧匈奴哉!”唐曰:“主臣!陛下虽得廉颇、李牧，弗能用也。”上怒，起入禁中。良久，召唐让曰:“公奈何众辱我，独无闲处乎?”唐谢曰:“鄙人不知忌讳。”

当是之时，匈奴新大人朝那，杀北地都尉卬。

上以胡寇为意，乃卒复问唐曰:“公何以知吾不能用廉颇、李牧也?”

唐对曰:“臣闻上古王者之遣将也，跪而推毂，曰阃以内者，寡人制之;阃以外者，将军制之。”

军功爵赏，皆决于外，归而奏之。此非虚言也。

臣大父言，李牧为赵将居边，军市之租皆自用飨士，赏赐决于外，不从中扰也。

委任而责成功，故李牧乃得尽其智能，遣选车千三百乘，毂骑万三千，百金之士十万，

是以北逐单于，破东胡，灭澹林，西抑强秦，南支韩、魏。

当是之时，赵几霸。

其后会赵王迁立，其母倡也。

王迁立，乃用郭开谗，卒诛李牧，令颜聚代之。

是以兵破士北，为秦所禽灭。

今臣窃闻魏尚为云中守，其军市租尽以维士卒，出私养钱，五日一椎牛，飨宾客军吏舍人，

是以匈奴远避，不近云中之塞。

虏曾一人，尚率车骑击之，所杀甚众。

夫士卒尽家人子，起田中从军，安知尺籍伍符。

终日力战，斩首捕虏，上功莫府，一言不相应，文吏以法绳之。

其赏不行而吏奉法必用。

臣愚，以为陛下法太明，赏太轻，罚太重。

且云中守魏尚坐上功首虏差六级，陛下下之吏，削其爵，罚作之。

由此言之，陛下虽得廉颇、李牧，弗能用也。

臣诚愚，触忌讳，死罪死罪!

文帝说。

是日令冯唐持节赦魏尚，复以为云中守，

而拜唐为车骑都尉，主中尉及郡国车士。

七年，景帝立，以唐为楚相，免。武帝立，求贤良，举冯唐。唐时年九十余，不能复为官，乃以唐子冯遂为郎。遂字王孙，亦奇士，与余善。

太史公曰:张季之言长者，守法不阿意;冯公之论将率，有味哉!有味哉!语曰:“不知其人视其友。”二君之所称诵，可著廊庙。《书》曰:“不偏不党，王道荡荡;不党不偏，王道便便。”张季、冯公近之矣。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">廷尉张释之是堵阳人，字季。有个哥哥张仲和他住在一起。他因为家财殷实得以入选为骑郎，事奉孝文帝，十年没有得到升 迁，名声也不为人所知。张释之说：“长久做郎官耗减哥哥的家产，心中不安。”想自己要求免职回家。中郎将袁盎知道他贤能，舍不得他离开，于是奏请迁调张释之补谒者的缺职。张释之 朝见完毕之后，趁机上前陈述便国宜民的事。文帝说：“现实一些，不要太高谈阔论，要使得当今可以施行。”于是张释之谈论起秦、汉之间的事情，讲起秦朝灭亡和汉朝兴起的原因，讲了很久。文帝称好，就任命张释之为谒者仆射。

张释之跟从皇帝出行，登览虎圈。皇上问上林尉各种禽兽的簿册登记情况，提了十几个问题，上林尉左看右看，都答不上来。看管虎圈的啬夫从旁边代替上林尉回答皇上所问的禽兽簿册，答得很详细，想要以此来显示他回答应对无穷无尽的才能。 文帝说：“官吏不应当像这样吗?上林尉无能!”于是下诏命张释之任命啬夫为上林令。张释之许久才上前说：“陛下认为绛侯周 勃是什么样的人呢?”皇上说：“是忠厚长者。”张释之又问： “东阳侯张相如是什么样的人呢?”皇上又说：“他是忠厚长者。”张释之说：“绛侯、东阳侯被称做忠厚长者，这两个人谈  论事情时竟然话都说不利落，难道也要学这个啬夫滔滔不绝、伶牙利齿那样吗!况且秦朝因为任用那些刀笔吏，他们争着拿办事急快和督察苛刻来互比高低，然而那样做的弊病只是官样文章罢了，没有一点仁慈的实情。因为这个原因上边根本听不到过失，日益衰败，传到了二世，天下便土崩瓦解了。如今陛下因为啬夫  能言善辩就越级提升他，我担心天下的人会随风而倒，争着学能言善辩而不讲求实实在在的东西，况且下面仿效上面比影子和回  声还要来得快，举措不可以不慎重。”文帝说：“好。”于是放弃了升迁啬夫的打算。

皇上上了车，令张释之陪乘，缓缓地前行，皇上问张释之有关秦朝的弊病。张释之都据实作了回答。到了宫中，皇上任命张释之做了公车令。

不久，太子和梁王同乘一辆车入朝，经过司马门时没有下车，这时张释之追上去制止太子、梁王不得进入殿门。于是又弹劾他们在司马门不下车为不敬之罪，上奏给朝廷。薄太后知道了这件事，文帝摘下冠冕向薄太后谢罪说:“我教导儿子不严。”薄太后这才派使者传令赦免太子、梁王，这样他们才得以入宫。文帝因为这件事而认为张释之有奇特之处，拜他为中大夫。不久，张释之升任中郎将。他随从皇上到霸陵，皇上在陵墓上面的北边远望。这时慎夫人跟随着，皇上指着去新丰的路给慎夫人看，说道:“这就是向邯郸去的路。”皇上让慎夫人鼓瑟，自已和着瑟的曲调唱歌，情意凄惨悲伤，回过头对群臣说:“唉!拿北山上的石头做外椁，把综麻、绵絮剁细，用漆粘合着塞在石椁的缝隙间，难道还能打得开吗!”左右的人都说:“是的。”张释之走上前说:“假使这里面有能够引起贪欲的东西，即使是封闭住南山，也还是有空隙;假使这里面没有能够引起贪欲的东西，即使没有石椁，又有什么可以忧虑的呢!”文帝称赞说好。这以后就	提升张释之做了廷尉。

不久，皇上出行经过中渭桥，有一个人从桥下面跑出来，皇上乘坐的车马受了惊。于是派骑士把那个人捕获，把他交付给廷尉。张释之审问那人。那人说:“我是县里的乡民来到这里，听到清道戒严的号令，藏到桥下面。过了许久，以为皇上的车马已经过去了，就从桥下出来，看见皇上乘坐的车马，立刻跑起来了。”廷尉上奏依法量刑应给予的处罚，一个人违反了清道戒严的号令，按刑法处以罚金。文帝大怒道:“这个人本身惊吓了我的马，幸亏我的马性情温和，假若是别的马，不是一定会伤害了我吗?可是廷尉却只判处他罚金!”张释之说:“法律是天子和天下人共同遵守的东西。现在法律是这样规定的，却要加重处罚，这样法律就不能取信于民了。况且在当时，皇上派人就地杀掉他也就罢了。现在既然交付给廷尉，廷尉是全国判刑公平的象征。一旦偏斜，天下使用法律时都会因此而减轻或加重，民众岂不要手足无措了吗?希望陛下明察这件事。”很久，皇上说:“廷尉量刑是对的。”

那以后，有个人偷了高祖庙神座前面的玉环，被抓住了，文帝大怒，交付给廷尉治罪。张释之按照法律中偷盗宗庙服饰器物的规定上奏，奏明应判处斩首示众。皇上非常恼怒说:“那个人无道胡为，竟敢偷盗先帝宗庙的器物，我之所以交付廷尉审理，是要灭掉他的全族，可是你却依法上奏这件案子，这不是我用来恭敬奉承宗庙的用意。”张释之摘掉帽子叩头赔罪说:“按照法律这样判处就足够了。况且斩首示众和灭族同样是死罪，但是以罪责的逆顺轻重程度而论，是有差别的。如今偷盗宗庙器物就诛灭他的全族，如果万一，假设愚民盗掘了长陵，陛下又该怎样加重对他的刑罚呢?”过了很久，文帝和太后谈论这件事，才准许了廷尉的判罚。当时，中尉条侯周亚夫和梁相山都侯王恬开看到张释之执法判决公正，就和他结为亲密朋友。张廷尉因此得到天下人的称颂。

后来文帝去世，景帝即位，张释之很恐惧，声称有病。他想	要辞职离开，害怕会有杀身大祸降临;想要见景帝当面谢罪，却又不知道怎样才好。他采用王生的计策，终于得以当面谢罪，景帝没有责怪他。

王生擅长黄老学说，是个处士。曾经被召进朝廷中，三公九卿都相聚而立，王生是老年人，说“我的袜子松了”，回头对张廷尉说:“替我系好袜子!”张释之跪下替他系好袜子。过后，有人对王生说:“为什么单单在朝廷上侮辱张廷尉，让他跪下替你系袜子?”王生回答说:“我年老而且地位卑贱，自己揣度终究不会对张廷尉有什么益处。张廷尉是当今天下的名臣，我故意要姑且侮辱廷尉，让他跪下替我系袜子，是想要加重他的名望。”各位公卿听说这件事，都称颂王生的贤能，敬重张廷尉。

张廷尉事奉景帝一年多，改作淮南王相，还是因为从前得罪过景帝的缘故。很久以后，张释之去世。他的儿子叫张挚，字长公，做官做到大夫，被免职。因为他不善于取悦当朝的权贵，所以终身没有再做官。

冯唐，他的祖父是赵国人。父亲迁居到代地。汉朝建立后迁徙到安陵。冯唐以孝行著称，做了中郎署长，事奉文帝。文帝乘车经过郎署时，问冯唐:“老人家为什么还做着郎官?家在哪里?”冯唐都如实回答了。文帝说:“我在代地的时候，我的尚食监高祛多次对我谈论赵将李齐的贤能，他曾经战斗在巨鹿城下。如今我每当吃饭的时候，心思都未尝不是在巨鹿。老人家知道这个人的事迹吗?”冯唐回答说:“他还不如廉颇、李牧做将官高明。”皇上问:“为什么?”冯唐说:“我祖父在赵国的时候，当官领将，和李牧友善。我父亲从前做代相，和赵将李齐友善，知道他的为人。”皇上听说了廉颇、李牧的为人，非常高兴，拍打着大腿说:“唉!我偏偏不能得到廉颇、李牧做我的将官，有了他们我难道会担忧匈奴吗!”冯唐说:“主上!陛下就是得到廉颇、李牧，也不会起用的。”皇上大怒，起身进皇宫了。过了很久，召见冯唐责怪说:“你为什么当众侮辱我，难道就不能在避开人的地方说吗?”冯唐谢罪说:“我这粗鄙的人不知道忌讳。”

当时，匈奴新近大举入侵朝那，杀死北地都尉孙卬。

皇上忧虑胡人进犯这件事，就终于又去问冯唐:“你怎么知道我不能任用廉颇、李牧呢?”

冯唐回答说:“我听说上古的时候，君王派遣将官，要跪下推着车子，说朝中的事情，我来决定;外面的事情，将军来决定。”

军功和爵位赏赐都由外面的将军决定，回来时再上奏朝廷。这不是虚妄的话。

我祖父说，李牧做赵国的将官守卫边塞，军中市场上征来的租税都自己用来赏赐士卒，赏赐由外面的将军决定，君王不从中干扰。

委托给他重任而要求他成功，因此李牧才能充分发挥他的智慧和才能，派遣选拔出来的战车一千三百辆，善射的骑兵一万三千人，能建战功的精锐士卒十万人，

因此向北驱逐了单于，击破了东胡，消灭了澹林，在西面抑制了强大的秦国，在南面抗拒韩、魏。

当时，赵国几乎称霸天下。

这以后赶上赵王迁即位，他的母亲原是艺妓。

赵王迁即位，就因为听了郭开的谗言，终于杀掉了李牧，让颜聚代替他。

因此军队战败，被秦国消灭掉了。

如今我私下里听说魏尚担任云中太守，他把军中市场上征来的租税全部拿来赏赐士兵，还拿出自己的俸禄，每五天椎杀一头牛，款待宾客、军吏和属官，

因此匈奴远远地避开，不敢靠近云中要塞。

匈奴曾经有一次入侵，魏尚率领兵马抗击，杀死非常多的敌人。

那些士卒全都是民家子弟，从乡村出来参军，怎会知道“尺籍”“伍符”之类的军中法令。

整天努力战斗，斩杀敌人首级，抓捕敌军俘虏，向将官报功时，仅仅一句话没有互相符合，司法官就用法令来制裁他们。

他们应得的赏赐没有给予，可是司法官奉行的法令却一定要执行。

我很愚蠢，认为陛下的法令太严明，赏赐太轻，惩罚太重。

况且云中太守魏尚就因为上报斩杀的敌人差了六个首级，陛下把他交付给司法官治罪，削夺了他的爵位，判处了一年徒刑。

从这件事说来，陛下即使是得到了廉颇、李牧，也不会使用的。

我确实愚蠢，触犯了忌讳，死罪死罪!

文帝听了很高兴。

当天下令让冯唐持节赦免魏尚，重新让他担任云中太守，

并且拜冯唐为车骑都尉，掌管中尉和各郡国的车战士兵。

后元七年(公元前 157年)，景帝即位，任命冯唐为楚国丞相，后来免了职。武帝即位，访求贤良，举荐冯唐。冯唐当时年龄已经九十多岁了，不能再担任官职了，就让冯唐的儿子冯遂当了郎官。冯遂字王孙，也是个有奇才的人，和我很友善。

太史公曰:张季谈论忠厚长者，遵守法度不迎合上面的意图;冯公谈论将官率军作战，有味道啊!有味道啊!俗话说:“不了解那个人，就看看他的朋友。”二位先生所称颂的人，可以标著在朝廷上。《书经》上说:“不偏私不结党，王道就会坦荡;不结党不偏私，王道就会平坦通畅。”张季、冯公接近于不偏私、不结党的标准了。</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">The chief justice Zhang Shizhi,whose courtesy name was Zhang Ji,was a man of Duyang and lived with his elder brother Zhang Zhong. He bought the post of a cavalry guard under Emperor Wen,but served for ten years without winning promotion,remaining unknown."I have servedallthis time and been a considerable expense to my brother,without getting anywhere,"he said and offered to resign and go home.But Yuan Ang,the captain of the palace guards,knew his ability and thought it would be a pity if he left.He therefore had him trans- ferred to the post of an imperial herald.After his presentation at court,Zhang Shizhi stepped forward to propose reforms."Let's have no high-flown schemes,"said Emperor Wen,"but modest proposals which can be put into practice.”Then Zhang Shizhi spoke at some length of the Qin and Han Dynasties,the reason for Qin's downfall and Han's rise to power.The emperor,approving his views,made him the chief herald.

Once he went with Emperor Wen to see the Tiger Enclosure in Shanglin Park.The emperor asked the warden more than ten questions about the animals and birds listed in the park records,but the warden looked this way and that and could not reply.Then the tiger-keeper, standing near by,answered for him,going into great detail to display his knowledge,reeling off the answers and hardly stopping for breath.“That's how the warden should be,” said Emperor Wen. “The other fellow is no good.” He told Zhang Shizhi to have the keeper made warden of the park. After a little reflection, Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and asked,“What is your opinion, sir, of Zhou Bo the marquis of Jiang?” “An excellent man.” “What of ZhangXiangru the marquis of Dongyang?”"Another excellent man.” “You call both of them excellent men, yet when it comes to mak- ing reports they can hardly get a word out. They are not as glib and fluent as this keeper. The emperor of Qin employed scribes who tried to outdo each other in harshness and severity. Their fault was that they enforced the letter of the law, untempered by mercy, And as the em- peror never realized his mistakes, things went from bad to worse until, in the reign of the Second Emperor, the empire fell to pieces. If you promote this keeper for his eloquence, sir, I fear others will follow his example and aim at eloquence instead of solid worth. Those below respond to the influence of those above as swiftly as shadows or echoes. Appointments and dismissals should be carefully considered.”The emperor approved and did not promote the keeper.

Mounting his carriage, he asked Zhang Shizhi to take the reins, and as they drove slowly back questioned him about the mistakes of the Qin government. And he received practical, realistic answers. Upon their return to the palace, the emperor made him keeper of the palace gate.

Some time later the crown prince and prince of Liang drove to- gether to the palace, but did not stop at the outer gate. Zhang Shizhi ran after them, stopped them, and would not let them enter the inner gate. He reported them to the throne for their disrespect in failing to alight at the palace gate, and the matter was referred to Empress Dowa- ger Bo. Emperor Wen uncovered his head to apologize to her, saying,“I have not brought my sons up well,” after which she sent a messen- ger to order that the princes be pardoned, and then at last they were admitted. Much impressed by this, Emperor Wen appointed Zhang Shizhi a court adviser. And later on he became captain of the palace guards. Zhang Shizhi once accompanied Emperor Wen to the imperial	tomb at Baling. Looking down from the north side of the hill, the emperor turned to Lady Shen, who was also in attendance, and pointed out the Xinfeng highway. “That's the road to Handan," he told her. He asked her to play the cithern and sang to her accompaniment. Then gazing sadly at his courtiers he said, “Ah, if we used stone from the north hill for the outer coffin, filled the cracks with hemp and silk floss and covered the whole with lacquer, no thief could break in.” All agreed but Zhang Shizhi, who stepped forward and said, “If there is something men covet inside the coffin, even if it is sealed up under the south hill thieves will find a way in. If there is nothing men covet, even without a stone coffin there is no need to worry.” The emperor approved, and later made him chief justice.

Some time after this, Emperor Wen was crossing the Middle Wei Bridge when a man ran out from under the bridge, frightening the horses of the imperial carriage. Cavalrymen were sent to seize this man and take him to the chief justice. Zhang Shizhi tried the fellow, who said he came from the country; when he heard the order ‘Clear the way for the emperor!' he hid himself for a long time under the bridge, coming out when he thought the retinue had passed; then, at sight of the imperial carriage and riders, he ran. The chief justice recommended that he be fined for violating the order to clear the way. “That fellow frightened my horses!” protested Emperor Wen indignantly. “It's a good thing that team is so docile. Had they been any	 should have been hurt. Yet the chief justice simply fines him.” “The law should be observed by the Son of Heaven and the people alike,” replied Zhang. “This is the law and, were I to impose a heavier punishment, the people would lose faith in the law. If Your Majesty had ordered the man to be executed on the spot, no one would have objected. But the matter was referred to the chief justice who should administer justice impartially to all. If I show bias all officers will apply the law with a bias, and the people will not know what to do. I beg Your Majesty to consider this.” The emperor thought it over and said, “The sentence proposed by the chief justice is right.”

Later a jade ring was stolen from the shrine of Emperor Gaozu’s temple. The thief was caught and the emperor in a passion sent him to the chief justice for trial. Zhang Shizhi ruled that, since this was a case of stealing from an ancestral temple, the culprit should be publicly executed. The emperor protested in a rage, “This fellow had the effrontery to rob Emperor Gaozu's temple! I sent him to you expecting to have him and his relatives executed, but you simply passed sentence accord- ing to the law. This is not my idea of respect to ancestral temples.” Zhang Shizhi bared his head and bowed to apologize, saying, “That	is all the law demands. Besides, there are different degrees in the same crime. If you wiped out this man's relatives because he robbed the temple, how would you punish some fool --if we can imagine such a case - who dug up Emperor Gaozu's tomb?” Emperor Wen discussed this later with the empress dowager and they agreed that Zhang Shizhi was right.At that time the metropolitan tribune Zhou Yafu, marquis of Tiao, and Wang Tiankai,marquis of Shandu and prime minister of Liang, were so struck by Zhang Shizhi's fair administration of justice that they allied themselves with him by marriage. Then the fame of Chief Justice Zhang spread through all the land.

When Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing came to the throne,' Zhang Shizhi was afraid and pretended to be unwell. He wanted to resign but feared that might result in his execution. He wished to apologize, but did not know how the emperor would take it. Finally on the advice of Wang Sheng he apologized to Emperor Jing, who did not punish him.

Wang Sheng lived in retirement and was well versed in the teach- ings of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Zi. Once he was summoned to court and allowed to sit down while all the chief ministers were stand- ing around. The old man exclaimed, “My leggings are coming down!” And	 turning to Zhang Shizhi he said, “Tie them up for me, will you?” Zhang Shizhi knelt down and did as he was told Later Wang Sheng was asked, “Why did you insult the chief justice in public by making him kneel down and tie up your leggings?” “I am an old man in a humble position,”replied Wang Sheng.“What can I do to help the chief who is known throughout the land? I put him to the indignity of kneeling to tie up my leggings so that men might respect him even more.”Word of this increased men's regard for Wang Sheng as well as their respect for Zhang Shizhi.

Zhang Shizhi served as chief justice under Emperor Jing for more than a year, after which he was transferred to be chief minister to the prince of Huainan. Evidently this was because of his former fault. He died some time afterwards. His son Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong, served as a high official but was dismissed. Because he could not follow the fashion, he never again held an official post.

Feng Tang's grandfather came from Zhao. His father moved first to Dai and then, at the beginning of the Han Dynasty, to Anling. Be- cause of his reputation for filial piety Feng Tang served as a lieutenant to the chief of the palace guard under Emperor Wen. Once the emperor, passing in his sedan-chair, asked, “How did you become a palace guard? Where are you from?”When Feng Tang had explained his background the emperor said, “When I was in Dai, the imperial steward Gao Qu often told me what a fine general Li Qi of Zhao was, and how he fought that battle at Julu. Now I hardly ever sit down to a meal without thinking of the Battle of Julu. Did you know Li Qi?” “He was not such a great general as Lian Po and Li Mu,” said Feng Tang. “Why do you say that?” “When my grandfather served in Zhao as a centurion, he knew Li Mu well. And my father as chief minister of Dai was friendly with General Li Qi. So I know what sort of men they were.” Delighted to hear about Iian Po and Li Mu, the emperor slappedhis thigh and exclaimed, “Ah, if I had generals like them, I need notworry about the Huns!’, “Excuse my presumption, sir,’, said Feng Tang, 'But even if youhad I ian Po or Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. The emperor sprang up angrily and went back to the inner palaceAfter some time he summoned Feng Tang and reproached him. “Whydid you insult me in public?’, he asked. “Couldn't you have waited tilwe were alone?’ “I am a fool,’, apologized Feng 'Tang. “I should have held my tongue.”

When the Huns had just invaded Chaona in force, killing Sun Ang, the army commander of Beidi,

and the emperor was worried about their incursions, he finally asked Feng Tang how he knew he couldn't make good use of men like Lian Po or Li Mu;

in response, Feng Tang answered that he had heard ancient kings would kneel to push a general’s chariot wheels when seeing them off to war, saying they would handle domestic affairs while the general managed matters abroad,

with all military distinctions and awards decided by the general who only reported them after returning, and he added he was not making this up,

then recounted his grandfather’s story that when Li Mu served as a general at Zhao's frontier, he spent all revenue from camp markets on his men and decided awards without court interference,

allowing him to fully use his wisdom and ability—with 1,300 chariots, 13,000 mounted archers, and 100,000 elite fighters,

Li Mu drove away the Hunnish khan in the north, routed the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, halted powerful Qin’s advance in the west, and supported Han (403B.C.-230B.C.) and Wei (403B.C.-225B.C.) in the south,

making Zhao nearly the leader of the states,

but later King Qian (son of a dancing girl) ascended the throne,

listened to Guo Kai’s slanders, killed Li Mu, and appointed Yan Ju instead,

leading to Zhao’s army defeat, men fleeing, and King Qian’s capture by Qin;

Feng Tang then said he heard Wei Shang, when governor of Yunzhong, used all camp market revenue to feast his troops and spent his own money to kill an ox every five days for his protégés, officers, and stewards,

keeping the Huns at a distance from Yunzhong’s ramparts,

and inflicting heavy casualties on them when they crossed the frontier,

and he pointed out that soldiers were simple peasants from the fields who knew nothing of official documents (like military registers and team rosters),

yet after hard fighting, if there was inconsistency in their reports of enemies killed or captured when submitting merits to the headquarters, civil officers punished them by law,

while rewards were rarely granted;

concluding that in his humble opinion, the emperor’s laws were too strict, rewards too small, and penalties too heavy—

citing Wei Shang’s punishment (tried, degraded of his title, and sentenced to penal servitude for reporting six more enemy heads than the actual number) as proof,

that even Lian Po or Li Mu would not be usable by the emperor,

and he apologized for being a simpleton who couldn’t hold his tongue and deserved death for his presumption;

Emperor Wen was pleased,

so that same day he sent Feng Tang with imperial credentials to pardon Wei Shang and reinstate him as governor of Yunzhong,

and made Feng Tang a tribune of chariots and cavalry in charge of the chariots and horsemen under the Central Garrison Commander (Zhongwei) and local principalities.

Seven years later Emperor |ing came to the throne and appointedFeng Tang chief minister of Chu, but later dismissed him. After Emperor Wu ascended the throne,? he made a search for able and worthy men and Feng Tang was recommended, He was then over ninetyhowever, and could not serve as an official, so his son Feng Sui wasmade a palace guard, Feng Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun. He, too,was a remarkable man and a good friend of mine.

The Grand Historian comments: Zhang Shizhi knew what constitutes a superior man and he upheld the law regardless of the emperor’s wishes, while Feng Tang's comments on what makes a good generalare well worth pondering too. The proverb says, “You can know aman by his friends.” The sayings of these two men deserve to bepreserved in the court archives, The Book of Documents says,“Noprejudice, no bias, how broad is the Kingly Way! No bias, no prejudicehow smooth is the Kingly Way!” Both Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tangcame close to this.</div>
