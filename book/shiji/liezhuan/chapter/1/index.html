          <div class="txt">吴王濞者，高帝兄刘仲之子也。高帝已定天下六年,立刘仲为代王。而匈奴攻代,刘仲不能坚守，弃国亡，间行走雒阳，自归天子。天子为骨肉故，不忍致法，废以为邰阳侯。高帝十一年秋,淮南王英布反,东并荆地，劫其国兵,西度淮，击楚,高帝自将往诛之。刘仲子沛侯濞年二十,有气力，以骑将从破布军蕲西会甄，布走。荆王刘贾为布所杀，无后。上患吴、会稽轻悍,无壮王以填之,诸子少，乃立濞于沛为吴王,王三郡五十三城。已拜受印，高帝召濞相之，谓曰：“若状有反相。”心独悔，业已拜，因拊其背，告曰：“汉后五十年东南有乱者，岂若邪?然天下同姓为一家也，慎无反“!”濞顿首曰：“不敢。”

会孝惠、高后时,天下初定，郡国诸侯各务自拊循其民。吴有鄣郡铜山,濞则招致天下亡命者盗铸钱，煮海水为盐，以故无赋，国用富饶。

孝文时，吴太子入见，得侍皇太子饮博。吴太子师傅皆楚人，轻悍,又素骄，博，争道，不恭，皇太子引博局提吴太子，杀之。于是遣其丧归葬。至吴，吴王愠曰：“天下同宗,死长安即葬长安，何必来葬为!”复遣丧之长安葬。吴王由此稍失藩臣之礼，称病不朝。京师知其以子故称病不朝，验问实不病，诸吴使来，辄系责治之。吴王恐，为谋滋甚。及后使人为秋请,上复责问吴使者，使者对曰：“王实不病，汉系治使者数辈，以故遂称病。且夫‘察见渊中鱼不祥’。今王始诈病，及觉，见责急，愈益闭,恐上诛之，计乃无聊。唯上弃之而与更始。”于是天子乃赦吴使者归之，而赐吴王几杖,老，不朝。吴得释其罪，谋亦益解。然其居国以铜盐故，百姓无赋。卒践更，辄与平贾。岁时存问茂材，赏赐闾里。佗郡国吏欲来捕亡人者，讼共禁弗予。如此者四十余年，以故能使其众。

晁错为太子家令,得幸太子，数从容言吴过可削。数上书说孝文帝,文帝宽，不忍罚，以此吴日益横。及孝景帝即位，错为御史大夫,说上曰：“昔高帝初定天下，昆弟少，诸子弱，大封同姓，故王孽子悼惠王王齐七十余城,庶弟元王王楚四十余城,兄子濞王吴五十余城：封三庶孽，分天下半。今吴王前有太子之郄,诈称病不朝，于古法当诛，文帝弗忍，因赐几杖。德至厚，当改过自新。乃益骄溢，即山铸钱，煮海水为盐，诱天下亡人，谋作乱。今削之亦反，不削之亦反。削之，其反亟，祸小；不削，反迟，祸大。”三年冬，楚王朝,晁错因言楚王戊往年为薄太后服，私奸服舍,请诛之。诏赦，罚削东海郡。及前二年赵王有罪,削其河间郡。胶西王卬以卖爵有奸,削其六县。

汉廷臣方议削吴。吴王濞恐削地无已，因以此发谋，欲举事。念诸侯无足与计谋者，闻胶西王勇，好气，喜兵，诸齐皆惮畏,于是乃使中大夫应高逃胶西王。无文书，口报曰：“吴王不肖，有宿夕之忧，不敢自外，使喻其驩心。”王曰：“何以教之?”高曰：“今者主上兴于奸，饰于邪臣,好小善，听谗贼，擅变更律令，侵夺诸侯之地，征求滋多，诛罚良善，日以益甚。里语有之，‘舐糠及米’回。吴与胶西，知名诸侯也，一时见察，恐不得安肆矣。吴王身有内病，不能朝请史_记二十余年，尝患见疑,无以自白，今胁肩累足,犹惧不见释。窃闻大王以爵事有適,所闻诸侯削地，罪不至此,此恐不得削地而已。”王曰：“然，有之。子将奈何?”高曰：“同恶相助，同好相留，同情相成，同欲相趋，同利相死。今吴王自以为与大王同忧，愿因时循理，弃躯以除患害于天下，亿亦可乎?”王瞿然骇曰：“寡人何敢如是?今主上虽急，固有死耳，安得不戴?”高曰：“御史大夫晁错，荧惑天子,侵夺诸侯，蔽忠塞贤，朝廷疾怨，诸侯皆有倍畔之意，人事极矣。彗星出，蝗虫数起，此万世一时，而愁劳圣人之所以起也。故吴王欲内以晁错为讨，外随大王后车，彷徉天下,所乡者降，所指者下，天下莫敢不服。大王诚幸而许之一言，则吴王率楚王略函谷关，守荥阳敖仓之粟,距汉兵。治次舍，须大王。大王有幸而临之，则天下可并，两主分割，不亦可乎?”王曰：“善。”高归报吴王，吴王犹恐其不与，乃身自为使，使于胶西，面结之。

胶西群臣或闻王谋，谏曰：“承一帝，至乐也。今大王与吴西乡，弟令事成，两主分争，患乃始结。诸侯之地不足为汉郡什二,而为畔逆以忧太后,非长策也。”王弗听。遂发使约齐、蓄川、胶东、济南、济北，皆许诺，而曰“城阳景王有义,攻诸吕，勿与，事定分之耳”。

诸侯既新削罚，振恐，多怨晁错。及削吴会稽、鄣郡书至,则吴王先起兵，诛汉吏二千石以下,胶西、胶东、蓄川、济南、楚、赵亦然，遂发兵西。齐王后悔，畔约。济北王城坏未完，其郎中令劫守其王，不得发兵。胶西为渠率，胶西、胶东、蓄川、济南共攻围临蓄。赵王遂亦反,阴使匈奴与连兵。

七国之发也，吴王悉其士卒,下令国中曰：“寡人年六十二，身自将。少子年十四，亦为士卒先。诸年上与寡人比，下与少子等者，皆发。”发二十余万人。南使闽越、东越,东越亦发兵从。

孝景帝三年正月甲子，初起兵于广陵。西涉淮，因并楚兵。发使遗诸侯书曰：“吴王刘濞敬闻胶西王、胶东王、蓄川王、济南王、赵王、楚王、淮南王、衡山王、庐江王、故长沙王子:幸教寡人以‘汉有贼臣，无功天下，侵夺诸侯地，使吏劾系讯治，以戮辱之为故，不以诸侯人君礼遇刘氏骨肉，绝先帝功臣，进任奸宄，读乱天下，欲危社稷。陛下多病志失，不能省察。欲举兵诛之'。谨闻教。敝国虽狭，地方三千里；人虽少，精兵可具五十万。寡人素事南越三十余年,其王君皆不辞分其卒以随寡人，又可得三十余万。寡人虽不肖，愿以身从诸王。越直长沙者，因王子定长沙以北,西走蜀、汉中。告越、楚王、淮南三王,与寡人西面；齐诸王与赵王定河间、河内,或入临晋关，或与寡人会雒阳;燕王、赵王固与胡王有约，燕王北定代、云中,抟胡众入萧关，走长安，匡正天子，以安高庙。愿王勉之。楚元王子、淮南三王或不沐洗十余年，怨入骨髓，欲一有所出之久矣,寡人未得诸王之意，未敢听。今诸王苟能存亡继绝，振弱伐暴，以安刘氏,社稷之所愿也。敝国虽贫，寡人节衣食之用，积金钱，修兵革，聚谷食，夜以继日，三十余年矣。凡为此,愿诸王勉用之。能斩捕大将者，赐金五千斤，封万户；列将，三千斤，封五千户；裨将，二千斤，封二千户；二千石,千斤，封千户；千石,五百斤，封五百户：皆为列侯。其以军若城邑降者，卒万人，邑万户，如得大将;人户五千,如得列将；人户三千，如得裨将；人户千，如得二千石；其小吏皆以差次受爵金”。佗封赐皆倍常法。其有故爵邑者，更益勿因。愿诸王明以令士大夫，弗敢欺也。寡人金钱在天下者往往而有，非必取于吴,诸王日夜用之弗能尽。有当赐者告寡人，寡人且往遗之。敬以闻。”

七国反书闻天子，天子乃遣太尉条侯周亚夫将三十六将军，往击吴楚;遭曲周侯郦寄击赵;将军栾布击齐;大将军窦婴屯荥阳监齐赵兵。

吴楚反书闻，兵未发，窦婴未行，言故吴相袁盎。盎时家居，诏召入见。上方与晁错笨军食,上问袁盎曰：“君尝为吴相，知吴臣田禄伯为人乎?今吴楚反，于公何如?”对曰：“不足忧也，今破矣。”上曰：“吴王即山铸钱，煮海水为盐，诱天下豪桀，白头举事。此其计不百全，岂发乎?何以言其无能为也?”袁盎对曰：“吴有铜盐利则有之，安得豪桀而诱之!诚令吴得豪桀，亦且辅王为义，不反矣。吴所诱皆无赖子弟，亡命铸钱奸人,故相率以反。”晁错曰：“袁盎策之善。”上问曰：“计安出?”盎对曰：“愿屏左右。”上屏人，独错在。盎曰：“臣所言，人臣不得知也。”乃屏错。错趋避东厢，恨甚。上卒问盎，盎对曰：“吴楚相遗书曰：‘高帝王子弟各有分地，今贼臣晁错擅適过诸侯,削夺之地'。故以反为名，西共诛晁错，复故地而罢。方今计独斩晁错，发使赦吴楚七国，复其故地,则兵可无血刃而俱罢。"于是上嘿然良久，曰：“顾诚何如，吾不爱一人以谢天下。”盎曰：“臣愚计无出此，愿上孰计之。”乃拜盎为太常，吴王弟子德侯为宗正,盎装治行。后十余日，上使中尉召错，绐载行东市。错衣朝衣斩东市"。则遣袁盎奉宗庙，宗正辅亲戚,使告吴如盎策。至吴，吴楚兵已攻梁壁矣。宗正以亲故，先入见，谕吴王使拜受诏。吴王闻袁盎来，亦知其欲说己，笑而应曰：“我已为东帝，尚谁拜?”不肯见盎而留之军中，欲劫使将。盎不肯，使人围守，且杀之，盎得夜出，步亡去，走梁军，遂归报。

条侯将乘六乘传,会兵荥阳。至雒阳，见剧孟,喜曰：“七国反，吾乘传至此，不自意全。又以为诸侯已得剧孟，剧孟今无动。吾据荥阳，以东无足忧者。”至淮阳,问父绛侯故客邓都尉曰:“策安出?”客曰：“吴兵锐甚，难与争锋。楚兵轻，不能久。方今为将军计，莫若引兵东北壁昌邑,以梁委吴,吴必尽锐攻之。将军深沟高垒，使轻兵绝淮泗口,塞吴饷道。彼吴梁相敝而粮食竭，乃以全强制其罢极，破吴必矣。”条侯曰：“善。”从其策,遂坚壁昌邑南，轻兵绝。

吴王之初发也，吴臣田禄伯为大将军。田禄伯曰：“兵屯聚而西，无佗奇道，难以就功。臣愿得五万人，别循江淮而上，收淮南、长沙，入武关,与大王会,此亦一奇也。”吴王太子谏曰：“王以反为名，此兵难以藉人,藉人亦且反王，奈何?且擅兵而别，多佗利害,未可知也，徒自损耳。”吴王即不许田禄伯。

吴少将桓将军说王曰:“吴多步兵，步兵利险；汉多车骑，车骑利平地。愿大王所过城邑不下，直弃去，疾西据雒阳武库,食敖仓粟,阻山河之险以令诸侯,虽毋入关，天下固已定矣。即大王徐行，留下城邑，汉军车骑至，驰入梁楚之郊,事败矣。”吴王问诸老将，老将曰：“此少年推锋之计可耳，安知大虑乎!”于是王不用桓将军计。

吴王专并将其兵,未度淮，诸宾客皆得为将、校尉、候、司马,独周丘不得用。周丘者，下邳人,亡命吴，酤酒无行，吴王濞薄之，弗任。周丘上谒，说王曰：“臣以无能，不得待罪行间。臣非敢求有所将，愿得王一汉节,必有以报王。”王乃予之。周丘得节，夜驰入下邳。下邳时闻吴反，皆城守。至传舍，召令。令入户，使从者以罪斩令。遂召昆弟所善豪吏告曰：“吴反兵且至，至，屠下邳不过食顷。今先下，家室必完，能者封侯矣。”出乃相告，下邳皆下。周丘一夜得三万人，使人报吴王，遂将其兵北略城邑。比至城阳，兵十余万，破城阳中尉军。闻吴王败走，自度无与共成功，即引兵归下邳。未至，疽发背死。

二月中，吴王兵既破，败走,于是天子制诏将军曰:“盖闻为善者，天报之以福；为非者，天报之以殃。高皇帝亲表功德，建立诸侯，幽王、悼惠王绝无后,孝文皇帝哀怜加惠，王幽王子遂、悼惠王子卬等,令奉其先王宗庙，为汉藩国，德配天地，明并日月。吴王濞倍德反义，诱受天下亡命罪人，乱天下币,称病不朝二十余年，有司数请濞罪，孝文皇帝宽之，欲其改行为善。今乃与楚王戊、赵王遂、胶西王卬、济南王辟光、蓄川王贤、胶东王雄渠约从反，为逆无道，起兵以危宗庙，贼杀大臣及汉使者,迫劫万民，夭杀无罪，烧残民家，掘其丘冢，甚为暴虐。今卬等又重逆无道，烧宗庙、卤御物,朕甚痛之。朕素服避正殿,将军其劝士大夫击反虏。击反虏者，深入多杀为功，斩首捕虏比三百石以上者皆杀之，无有所置。敢有议诏及不如诏者，皆要斩。”

初，吴王之度淮，与楚王遂西破棘壁,乘胜前，锐甚。梁孝王恐，遣六将军击吴，又败梁两将，士卒皆还走梁。梁数使使报条侯求救，条侯不许。又使使恶条侯于上，上使人告条侯救梁，复守便宜不行。梁使韩安国及楚死事相弟张羽为将军,乃得颇败吴兵。吴兵欲西，梁城守坚，不敢西，即走条侯军,会下邑。欲战，条侯壁，不肯战。吴粮绝，卒饥，数挑战，遂夜奔条侯壁，惊东南。条侯使备西北，果从西北入。吴大败，士卒多饥死，乃畔散。于是吴王乃与其麾下壮士数千人夜亡去，度江走丹徒，保东越。东越兵可万余人，乃使人收聚亡卒。汉使人以利啖东越，东越即绐吴王，吴王出劳军，即使人杀吴王，盛其头，驰传以闻。吴王子子华、子驹亡走闽越。吴王之弃其军亡也，军遂溃，往往稍降太尉、梁军。楚王戊军败，自杀。

四王之围齐临蓄也,三月不能下。汉兵至,胶西、胶东、蓄川王各引兵归。胶西王乃袒跣、席藁、饮水,谢太后。王太子德曰：“汉兵远来,臣观之已罢，可袭，愿收大王余兵击之，击之不胜，乃逃入海，未晚也。”王曰：“吾士卒皆已坏，不可发用。”弗听。汉将弓高侯颓当遗王书曰:“奉诏诛不义，降者赦其罪，复故；不降者灭之。王何处，须以从事。”王肉袒叩头汉军壁，谒曰：“臣卬奉法不谨，惊骇百姓，乃苦将军远道至于穷国，敢请范醯之罪。”弓高侯执金鼓见之,曰：“王苦军事，愿闻王发兵状。”王顿首膝行对曰：“今者，晁错天子用事臣，变更高皇帝法令，侵夺诸侯地。卬等以为不义，恐其败乱天下，七国发兵，且以诛错。今闻错已诛，卬等谨以罢兵归。”将军曰：“王苟以错不善，何不以闻?乃未有诏虎符，擅发兵击义国。以此观之，意非欲诛错也。”乃出诏书为王读之。读之讫，曰：“王其自图。”王曰：“如卬等死有余罪。”遂自杀。太后、太子皆死。胶东、蓄川、济南王皆死，国除，纳于汉。郦将军围赵七月而下之，赵王自杀。济北王以劫故，得不诛，徙王蓄川。

初，吴王首反，并将楚兵，连齐赵。正月起兵，三月皆破，独赵后下。复置元王少子平陆侯礼为楚王,续元王后。徙汝南王非王吴故地,为江都王。

太史公曰：吴王之王，由父省也。能薄赋敛，使其众，以擅山海之利。逆乱之萌，自其子兴。争技发难，卒亡其本；亲越谋宗，竟以夷陨。晁错为国远虑，祸反近身。袁盎权说，初宠后辱。故古者诸侯地不过百里，山海不以封。“毋亲夷狄，以疏其属”,盖谓吴邪?“毋为权首，反受其咎”,岂盎、错邪?</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">吴王刘濞，是刘邦的哥哥刘仲的儿子。刘邦平定天下之后的第六年，封刘仲为代王。后来匈奴进攻代国时，刘仲不能抗敌守土，而是丢下国土人民，一个人抄小路逃到了雒阳，回到了刘邦这里。刘邦看在骨肉的情义上，没有依法制裁，只是把他降为了邻阳侯。高祖十一年秋天，淮南王英布造反，往东吞并了荆国地盘，劫持着荆国兵马，一道西下渡过了淮河，攻击楚国，刘邦亲自领兵前往征讨。这时刘仲的儿子沛侯刘濞年仅二十，勇敢有为，以骑将的身份跟随刘邦一道大破英布军于蕲县西面的会甄，英布逃走。当时荆王刘贾已被英布所杀，又没有后代。刘邦觉得吴郡、会稽的民风懦悍，担心不派个年长力强的人来当王镇压不住，而自己的儿子们都很小，于是就在回经沛县的时候封刘濞做了吴王，让他去管辖三个郡五十三座城。等到任命授印完毕，刘邦把刘濞叫来端详着他的长相，说：“看你的样子像是有一种反相。”这时心里就有点后悔了，但由于已经任命，于是就拍着刘濞的背嘱咐說：“再过五十年东南上将要有人造反，难道这个人就是你吗?我们姓刘的各个封国可都是一家子，千万不能造反!”刘濞伏地叩头说：“绝对不敢。”

后来在孝惠、高后执政时，国家刚刚安定，因而各郡县与各个诸侯国也都在各自忙于安抚自己的百姓。吴国的鄣郡有一座产铜的矿山，于是刘濞就偷着大肆招纳那些各地的亡命徒让他们去给自己铸钱，又煮海水制盐，由于他有这两项收入，所以即使不向吴国的百姓们收税，吴国的财力也非常富。

孝文帝在位时，吴王濞的太子进京朝见，有一天陪着皇太子一道饮酒下棋。吴太子的师傅都是楚地人，因而把吴太子惯得从小就轻浮暴躁，而且骄横。他在和皇太子下棋的过程中，为争执该谁走而吵了起来，吴太子表现得不礼貌，皇太子就抄起棋盘砸吴太子，把吴太子打死了。于是朝廷只好让吴国的来人把吴太子的尸体运回了吴国。丧车回吴国后，吴王濞大怒，说：“既然都是一家子，死在长安那就葬在长安算了，何必还一定要送回来呢!”于是又硬是让人把吴太子的尸体运回到长安埋葬了。从此吴王就渐渐地失去了藩臣对天子的礼节，推说有病不再进京朝拜。朝廷估计着他是因为儿子的缘故故意装病不来，于是就派人来调查，结果发现确实没病，从此凡是吴国的使者进了京，都要被关起来接受审问。吴王也害怕了，于是也就越来越图谋着造反。后来在一个秋天，吴王濞派人代他进京朝见，文帝又责问吴国使者，使者对文帝说：“吴王确实没病，但由于中央一连扣押了几起吴国的使者，所以吴王就称病不来了。俗话说：‘如果连深水里的鱼也都看得清清楚楚，那是不好的。'吴王开始是装病，后来被您发觉了，因为您对他追得紧，所以他也就越来越躲着您，因为他害怕您杀他，所以他也就要想一些没有办法的办法。依我看还是请您不要再计较他以前的过失，而应重新和他搞好关系。”文帝一听有理，随即放回了过去被关押的吴国使者，还赐给了吴王一张小几一根手杖，说他年纪大了，可以不必进京朝拜。吴王一见自己的罪过被免了，于是造反的心思也就渐渐地放下了。然而他在国内因为有铸钱煮盐的收益，仍是不向百姓们征税。每当中央调吴国百姓去服劳役的时候，他就发给他们一份相应的钱。每到过年过节就派人去慰问那些有才学的人，一般平民百姓也都可以得到一定的赏赐。其他郡国的罪犯逃到吴国，遭到原郡国的追捕时，吴王总是公然地出来加以保护，不把他们交出去。就这样一直过了四十多年，所以吴国人都愿意听他的调遣。

当时晁错正做太子家令，很受太子的赏识，他曾多次对太子说吴王的地盘权势应该削减。由于孝文帝为人宽厚，没好意思惩办吴王，结果吴王就越来越骄横。等到孝景帝即位后，晁错做了御史大夫，他又劝皇上说：“当初高祖刚平定天下的时候，因为同胞弟兄少，自己的儿子又太小，所以才大规模地封了一些姓刘的人，因此才封了庶子刘肥为齐王下辖七十余城，封了弟弟刘交为楚王下辖四十余城，封了哥哥刘仲的儿子刘濞为吴王下辖五十余城：这三个人都不是高祖的正根，而所占的地盘却几乎去了全国的一半。吴王因为怀着过去儿子被杀的仇恨，推说有病不来朝拜，这要按照古法就应该杀头，但文帝不忍心查办他，反而赐给了他几案和手杖。这是多么大的恩德呀，按说在这样的感召下，他就应该改过自新。结果他却更加骄横无忌了，他就着铜山铸钱，靠着海水煮盐，还一个劲地招纳各地跑去的亡命之徒，准备着造反。现在的形势是削他的地盘他要造反，不削他的地盘他也是要造反。削他，他反得早，造成的祸害小；不削他，他反得晚，将来的祸害更大。”孝景帝三年冬天，楚王刘戊进京朝见，晁错遂对景帝说起去年在为薄太后办丧事期间，刘戊居然还与人发生奸情，请趁此杀了他。景帝下令赦免了楚王戊的死罪，削减了楚国的东海郡作为处罚。此外两年前因为赵王刘遂有罪，削去了他的常山郡；胶西王刘卬因为卖爵犯法，削去了他的六个县。

当汉朝的大臣们刚开始商量削减吴国地盘的时候，吴王刘濞害怕以后这么削减起来没完没了，于是就想借此机会发动叛乱。他把当时的诸侯国想了一遍，觉得他们没有一个能和自己共商大计，后来听说胶西王刘印勇猛好事，喜欢打仗，齐地的其他诸侯都怕他，于是刘濞就派了中大夫应高去挑拨胶西王。没有书信，只是让他口头去传达说：“我们的吴王没出息，现在正面临着说不定什么时候就会飞来的大难，对于您来说，我们不能把自己当作外人，所以派我来把吴王的心思告诉您。”刘卬说：“吴王对我有什么指教呢?”应高说：“现在皇上正被奸臣所怂恿，被坏人所蒙骗，只喜欢那些枝枝节节的好看，专门听信谗言，他随便变更国家旧有的法令，随便侵夺诸侯们的地盘，他征敛财物，杀害好人的问题也越来越严重。俗话说：‘舐破糠皮就要轮到米粒了。’吴国和胶西，都是知名的大国，一旦被朝廷察问，那就恐怕永远不得安生了。吴王因为有病，已经二十多年没有进京朝贡，他总是担心被朝廷猜疑，没有办法表白自己，现在即使谨小慎微一动不动，也仍是怕不被放过。我们听说您因为卖爵的事受到了处罚，同时我们还听说别的诸侯也因为鸡毛蒜皮的事情被削减了土地，而且看来还不是光被削点地盘就算完事的。”胶西王说：“对，可能是这样。那你认为该怎么办呢?”应高说：“有共同仇恨的人应该相互援助，有共同爱好的人应该相互留恋，情趣相同就应该相互助成，想法一致就应该共同奔赴，利益相关就应该通力死干。现在吴王自以为他和您有着共同的忧患，希望和您一道趁着时机，沿着常理，豁出命去为天下除害，您考虑行吗?”刘印一听吓了一跳说：“我怎么敢干这个呢?现在皇上逼得我再紧，最后我只不过是一死而已，我怎么能不承认他是我的主子呢?”应高说：“御史大夫晁错迷惑了皇上，是他怂恿皇上侵夺诸侯们的土地，堵塞了忠良们的前进之路，现在朝廷里的官员们也都非常恨他，诸侯们都产生了背叛朝廷的想法，从人的方面看现在已经到了极点；再看天象，彗星已经出现，蝗灾也多次发生，这可是万世难逢的一个好时机。百姓们的忧愁劳苦，正是促成圣人起事的好引线。现在吴王想以晁错为名对朝廷发起讨伐，想跟着您的车子荡平天下，一旦起事后，必将是打到哪里哪里投降，走到哪里哪里归顺，没有谁敢不服从的。现在只要您答应他一句话，那么吴王立刻就会率领着楚王去夺取函谷关，守住荥阳敖仓的粮食，挡住朝廷的军队不让他东下。而后收拾好住处，等待着您的光临。那时只要您肯去，那整个天下就都成了我们的，而后你们两位把它来个分而治之，不是很好吗?”刘卬说：“好。”于是应高回去报告了吴王，吴王还怕他变卦，又亲自到胶西去和他当面订好了联盟。

胶西国的大臣们有人听说刘卬参加了吴王的谋反，就劝刘卬说：“我们过去受一个皇帝的管辖，不是很好吗?现在您和吴王联兵西下，即使造反成功了，日后两个人为了分地盘那矛盾也会没完没了。况且诸侯们的地盘合起来还不到汉朝郡县的十分之二，这样您造起反来让您母亲跟着担忧，恐怕不是好办法。”刘卬不听，他又派人去联合齐王刘将闾、蓄川王刘贤、胶东王刘雄渠、济南王刘辟光、济北王刘志，这些人都答应了，而且说“城阳景王刘章当年伸张正义，攻灭诸吕有大功，我们现在不要拉他的儿子刘喜参加，等事成之后分给他一份土地就是了”。

诸侯们都是因为新近被朝廷削减了土地，一个个惊恐不安，心中怨恨晁错。等到削减吴国会稽、鄣郡的诏书一到，吴王就首先起兵造反了，他杀掉了汉朝派到吴国的二千石以下的各级官吏，接着胶西、胶东、甾川、济南、楚国、赵国也都照此办理，而后一起发兵西下。后来齐王刘将闾中途又后悔了，背叛了与其他四国的盟约。济北王的国都城墙坏了没有修好，他的郎中令把他劫持住，使得他不能发兵。这个地区只有胶西王刘印成了首领，他领着胶东、蓄川、济南几国的军队一同去围攻齐国的临淄。这时北方的赵王刘遂也宣布造反了，他暗中派人去和匈奴人进行联络。

当七国发动造反的时候，吴王刘濞要调动吴国一切可以调动的人，他向国内下令说：“我今年已经六十二了，我还亲自领兵出征。我的小儿子今年只有十四岁，他也走在了队伍的前面。现在上至我这个年龄，下至我小儿子的年龄，凡是在这中间的都要一律入伍。”于是全国发动了二十多万人。接着他又派人到南边的闽越、东越联络，东越也派人跟着来了。

孝景帝三年正月的甲子日，吴国从广陵起兵，渡淮河西下，与楚国的军队会师。随后派人给各国诸侯们发出一封公开信，说：“吴王刘濞恭敬地向胶西王、胶东王、蓄川王、济南王、赵王、楚王、淮南王、衡山王、庐江王，以及已故的长沙王的儿子问好：感谢你们教导我说：‘现在朝廷里出了乱臣贼子，他自己没有功劳，而专门挑唆皇上侵夺诸侯们的领地，他派人关押审讯我们各国派往朝廷的使者，以侮辱我们各国诸侯为能事，他根本不按照一方之主的礼节来对待我们刘氏骨肉，他还抛弃先帝的功臣不用，而专门任用一批坏蛋，他扰乱了天下人心，想要危害国家的政权。而皇上也因为体弱多病，神志昏昏，因而对晁错不能觉察。现在我们要起兵讨伐他。'我愿意听从你们各位诸侯的教导。我们吴国虽小，但也有三千里的地盘；我们的人口虽少，但也可以调出五十万精兵。三十多年来我一直与南越交好，现在他们的国王以及国内的各个郡长都不推辞，都愿意派兵随我出战，这样就又可以得到三十万人。我自己虽然没有什么出息，但我愿意跟在你们诸位的后面。南越与长沙国相连，你们可以跟着长沙王子先平定长沙以北，而后西向蜀郡、汉中。请东越王、楚王和淮南王，你们三位跟我一道率兵西下；请齐地的几位大王和赵王一起北定河间、西攻河内，而后或者是破临晋关入关中，或者是与我会师于雒阳；燕王、赵王本来就与匈奴有联系，燕王可以先夺取北部的代郡和云中，而后领着匈奴人进萧关，直扑长安。我们的目的是为了纠正天子的错误，使高祖的魂灵得到安宁。请诸位务必好自为之。楚元王的儿子、淮南的三个诸侯王有的都十多年没心思洗头洗澡，他们对朝廷恨入骨髓，早就想出一口气了，我当时因为没有得到你们诸位的同意，所以没敢答应他们起兵。今天诸位如果能让那些将要灭亡或已经灭亡的国家能够保存、恢复起来，能够帮助弱小去讨伐强暴，让刘氏家族得到安定，这是整个国家都希望的。我们吴国虽然穷，但我节衣缩食，积累金钱，修造兵器，聚积粮食，我已经夜以继日地奋斗三十多年了。我所以这么做，就是为了今天提供给大家使用。凡是能够斩杀或俘获敌人大将的，赏给黄铜五千斤，封给他采邑万户；凡是斩杀或俘获敌人列将的，赏给黄铜三千斤，封给他采邑五千户；杀死或俘获裨将的，赏给二千斤，封给二千户；杀死或俘获二千石的，赏一千斤，封千户；斩杀俘获千石的，赏给五百斤，封给五百户：都一律封为列侯。凡是带领军队或者献出城邑投降的，带来兵卒万人或交出万户城邑的，其赏赐和俘获敌人大将一样；带来五千人或交出五千户城邑的和俘获列将一样；带来三千人或交出三千户城邑的，和俘获裨将一样；带来千人或交出千户城邑的，和俘获二千石一样；如果俘获了其他小吏也都按着等级高低接受不同的封爵和赏金。由于其他原因而应该受到封赏的也都比平常加一倍。至于那些本来自己就有爵位封邑的，那就在旧有的爵邑外另行赏赐，绝不混为一谈。希望各位诸侯都把这些话明白地告诉你们手下的军官和士兵，我绝不会欺骗他们。吴国的钱庄天下到处都有，用不着非要到吴国领取，你们诸位敞开花也是花不完的。哪里有人该赏赐了请你们告诉我，我马上给他送去。我要告诉你们的就是这些。"

吴、楚等七国的造反宣言传到了汉景帝那里，汉景帝就派了太尉条侯周亚夫率领着三十六个将军，前往迎击吴、楚；派了曲周侯郦寄去讨伐赵国；派了将军栾布去讨伐齐地诸国；派了大将军窦婴驻兵荥阳，负责策应节制讨伐齐、赵的军队。

当吴、楚造反的消息传到朝廷，朝廷派去镇压的军队还没有出发的时候，这时窦婴就向景帝推荐了曾在吴国任过丞相的袁盎。袁盎当时正在家里闲着，景帝下令叫他进宫。袁盎进来的时候，景帝正跟晁错商量着调拨军队，计算粮草的事情。景帝问袁盎说：“您曾经做过吴国丞相，知道吴国田禄伯的为人吗?现在吴、楚几国造反了，你估计他们的来势怎么样?”袁盎说：“用不着担心，很快就可以打败他们。”景帝说：“吴王就着他的铜山铸钱，就海水煮盐，招引了各地的英雄豪杰去投奔他，他自己也是白发苍苍、老谋深算。在这种情况下，他要是没有十成的把握，能随便起事吗?怎么能说他办不成事呢?”袁盎回答说：“吴国能够铸钱、煮盐这是事实，但他怎么能够把真正的英雄豪杰招引去呢!如果他那里真有几个英雄豪杰，那他们也就该帮着吴王做好事，而不至于帮着他造反了。吴国所招引去的都是一些流氓无赖，一批改名换姓专造假钱的坏人，所以他们才能串连起来一道造反。”晁错说：“袁盎分析得不错。”景帝问道：“你看我们应该怎么办呢?”袁盎说：‘请您左右的人退下去。”于是景帝就让人们退了下去，只剩下晁错一人还在身旁。袁盎说，“我要说的话，任何做臣子的都不能听。”于是景帝又示意晁错也让他出去。晁错无法只好也趋避到了东厢内，心中恼恨袁盎。于是景帝又问袁盎，袁盎说：“吴、楚之间互相宣告的文书上说：‘当初高祖分封刘姓子弟为王，各人都有一份封地，现在奸臣晁错擅自惩罚诸侯，随便剥夺他们的领地。'他们的造反实际上只是为了讨伐晁错，要回他们被削去的土地。现在我们只要杀掉了晁错，派人去赦免吴、楚七国造反的罪名，把剥夺的他们的领地还给他们，那就用不着打仗流血他们就会自己回去了。”景帝默然不语想了半天，说：“关键在于这么做究竟行不行。只要能行，我当然不会舍不得杀一个人来向天下表示歉意。”袁盎说：“我不怎么聪明，但我认为没有任何办法能比这个更好了，希望您认真考虑。”于是皇帝立即任命袁盎为太常，任命吴王的侄子德侯为宗正，让他们收拾行装准备出使吴、楚。十多天后，景帝派中尉去叫晁错，中尉骗晁错上了车子一直把他拉到了东市。当时晁错还穿着一身上朝的衣服，糊里糊涂地就被杀掉了。接着景帝就派袁盎代表着国家的意思，派宗正刘德侯代表着刘氏宗族的意思，让他们按着袁盎所估计的那个样子去告慰吴王。他们到达吴军时，吴、楚的军队已经向梁国的工事发动进攻了。刘德侯因为是吴王的亲弟弟，所以先进去见吴王，他向吴王讲了皇上的意思，让他拜接皇上的诏书。这时吴王听说袁盎也一道来了，知道他也是来说服自己的，于是就笑着回答说：“我现在已经做了东帝，我还要向谁跪拜?”说罢他根本不见袁盎而把他扣留在军营中，想逼着他给自己做将领。袁盎不答应，吴王就派人把他看守起来并准备杀他。袁盎则趁着夜色逃出了吴军，徒步跑到了梁国的军队里，得路回了长安。

这时条侯周亚夫正坐着六匹马拉的紧急驿车，奔向荣阳前线与诸军会合。中途经过雒阳的时候，他见到了剧孟，周亚夫高兴地说：“七国联合造反，我居然还能坐着一辆驿车到达这里，安全无事。我还以为那伙造反的家伙们早就把剧孟请去了，没想到剧孟今天还在这里。如今我们已经占据了荥阳，那荥阳以东的形势也就用不着担忧了。”周亚夫到达淮阳后，向他父亲绛侯周勃的老宾客邓都尉讨教说：“您看我们该怎么办?”邓都尉说：“现在吴军的来势很猛，不能和他们正面硬碰。而楚兵比较浮躁，看样子不能坚持长久。现在为您考虑，不如先引兵往东北去坚守昌邑，把梁国扔给吴军打。吴军一定会尽着全部力量攻打梁国，而你在昌邑深沟高垒，坚守不出，暗中派一支小部队去占领淮河、泗水的交汇处，以掐断吴国运输粮食的通道。等到吴国和梁国相互消耗，粮食断绝时，然后你再出动你的全部兵力去打他，这样打败吴军就是必然的了。”周亚夫说：“好。”于是就按着邓都尉的办法，把军队驻扎在昌邑县南坚守不出，而派轻骑兵去切断了吴军运输粮食的通道。

吴王开始出兵的时候，任命田禄伯为大将军。田禄伯对吴王说：“如果我们单是把军队集中起来向西推进，而没有其他出人意料的办法，那是很难成功的。我请求带着五万人，沿着长江、淮河西上，去收服淮南、长沙两国而后西入武关，去关中跟您会师，这才是一条出人意料的路线。”而吴王的太子拦阻他的父亲说：“您现在完全是造反，造反的兵是不能交给别人管的，您要是交给别人，别人也起来反您，那您怎么办呢?而且让他领着一支人马单独行动，这也很容易出问题，胜败不得而知，白白地分散自己。”吴王一听，就否定了田禄伯的要求。

这时吴国的一员小将桓将军又来劝吴王说：“我们的军队是以步兵居多，而步兵有利于走险路；汉廷的军队车马居多，而车马则利于平地驰骋。希望大王凡遇到不好打的城镇就干脆甩下不打，而火速前去抢占雒阳的武库和夺取敖仓的粮食，到那时您凭借着太行山与黄河的险要形势来号令天下，即使一时入不了关，而整个的天下大势也就基本上定了。如果您行动迟缓，老是停下来攻打城池，等到朝廷的车骑兵一到，一驰骋在梁国、楚国的要冲，那我们的这次行动就要完蛋了。”吴王征求老将们的意见，老将们都说：“这是年青人急躁冒进的做法，他们哪会作长远考虑!"于是吴王也没听桓将军的意见。

吴王把所有的军队都集中在一起由自己领着，还没有渡过淮河，他手下的那些宾客们都当上了将军、校尉、候、司马等职务，只有周丘没有得到任用。周丘是下邳人，由于犯罪逃到了吴国，此人爱耍酒疯没有道德，因此吴王濞瞧不起，不任用他。而周丘却主动地找上门来对吴王说：“我由于没有本事，所以不能在您的军队里干事。现在我也没想请求您让我带什么兵，我只希望您给我一个汉廷的符节，我一定能给您办一件事。”于是吴王就给了他。周丘带着这个符节，连夜赶到了自己的老家下邳。当时下邳听说吴王造反了，正在派兵守城。周丘住进了旅馆后，立即派人请县令来见。县令刚一进旅店大门，周丘立刻就让随从宣布罪状杀死了县令。接着他就把他的弟兄以及过去和他关系不错的豪吏们叫来对他们说：“吴国造反的军队马上就到，吴兵一旦到达，他们要想杀光下邳人那是用不了一顿饭的工夫的。你们要是能够及早归顺，你们的全家老小就能保全，能耐大的人还可以封侯。”结果这些人出去一说，下邳很快就全部投降了。周丘一夜之间就招降了三万人，他派人回去向吴王报告，同时他又领着下邳的军队向北攻击。等他攻到城阳国的时候，他手下的军队就已经发展到十多万人了，接着他又打败了城阳中尉的军队。可是这时吴王失败的消息已经传来，他琢磨着已经没有人再跟自己一道共成大事，于是就带着军队回了下邳。还没有到家，他背上的毒疮就突然发作死去了。

二月中旬，吴王的军队已经被打败，四散而走，这时汉景帝就给周亚夫下诏说：“俗话说做好事的人，上天给他降福；做坏事的人，上天让他们遭殃。高皇帝当时为了表彰有功有德的人，而分封了许多诸侯。后来赵幽王、齐悼惠王由于正根断绝按理封国本该取消，但孝文皇帝可怜他们，格外开恩，因而封幽王的庶子刘遂、悼惠王的庶子刘卬等人为王，让他们祀奉自己先人的宗庙，作为朝廷的藩国，文皇帝的这种仁德简直可以和天地相比，这种英明简直可以和日月并存了。可是吴王刘濞却悖逆了道德和仁义的准则，招诱全国各地逃亡的罪犯，私铸钱币混乱天下，前后二十多年装病不进京朝见，大臣们早就多次请求治他的罪，而孝文皇帝一再宽恕他，目的是让他自己改恶从善。结果他今天反而跟楚王刘戊、赵王刘遂、胶西王刘卬、济南王刘辟光、蓄川王刘贤、胶东王刘雄渠联合造反，干出了大逆不道的勾当。他们公然出兵来危害宗庙社稷，杀害了朝廷的大臣和朝廷的使者，他们裹胁了许多良民百姓，杀害了许多无罪的人，他们烧毁民房，挖人坟墓，简直残虐到了极点。而刘卬等人尤其大逆不道，他们竟烧毁宗庙，抢夺宗庙里的东西，这是我最为痛恨的。我现在身穿素服避居偏殿，希望将军你督励全军将士英勇讨伐叛逆。在与叛逆们的战斗中谁能穷追猛打多杀敌人谁就有功，凡是捉到‘比三百石'以上的叛官通通杀掉，一个不留。谁敢指责或者是不执行这个诏令，一律腰斩。”

战争开始时吴王率军渡过了淮水，与楚王刘戊一起西下攻破了棘壁，接着乘胜前进，气势很猛。梁孝王很害怕，他派了六个将军率兵东上迎击吴军，结果有两个将军很快就被吴军打败了，许多士兵逃回了睢阳。梁王多次派人去昌邑向条侯周亚夫请求救援，周亚夫置之不理。梁王无法只好又派人去向汉景帝告周亚夫的状，汉景帝派人去告诉周亚夫让他出兵援救梁国，周亚夫仍然是占着有利地形按兵不动。后来梁王任命了韩安国和被楚王刘戊所杀的楚国丞相张尚的弟弟张羽为将军，才开始在对吴、楚作战中取得了一些胜利。吴兵想要西下，但由于梁国坚守着城池，吴兵不敢越城西进，于是就移兵北上向周亚夫杀来，双方相会于下邑。吴王出兵挑战，周亚夫仍是坚守壁垒，不与之交锋。后来吴军的粮草断绝，士兵开始饿肚子了，于是就更急于向周亚夫挑战。一天夜里他们向周亚夫的壁垒发起了进攻，开始他们攻击的是东南角，而周亚夫却下令让自己的军队注意防备西北角，结果不一会儿吴军的大队果然从西北上攻来。由于汉军有备，吴军顿遭惨败。许多士兵都饿死了，剩下的也纷纷溃散遁逃。吴王见此情景只好带着他手下的亲兵几千人连夜逃去，他们渡过长江经由丹徒，去投靠了东越。当时东越的军队差不多有一万来人，接着吴王又派人去收拾他那些逃散的军队，把他们招到东越来。这时朝廷派人去用金钱收买东越王，东越王被朝廷收买后就欺骗吴王，让吴王出来慰劳军队，吴王不知，结果被东越王趁机派人刺死了，随后他把吴王的人头装起来，派人乘着驿车飞快地送到了长安。吴王的儿子子华、子驹逃到了闽越。当吴王抛开自己的军队逃跑后，吴国军队也就随即溃散了，不少人都相继投降了周亚夫和梁国的军队。楚王刘戊在他们的军队被打败后，也随即自杀了。

当胶西王刘卬率领济南、蓄川、胶东三国围攻齐国临淄的时候，一直攻了三个月也没能攻下来。这时朝廷的大兵到了，胶西王、胶东王、蓄川王各自领着自己的军队撤回了本国。胶西王赤着脊梁光着脚，坐在草席上，光喝水不吃饭，向他的母亲认罪。这时他的儿子刘德说：“朝廷的军队经过千里跋涉来到这里，我看他们已经很疲惫了，我们可以突然袭击他们，争取胜利。请让我带着您剩下的军队给他们来一下，如果打不赢，我们就逃到海上去，反正怎么着也来得及。”胶西王说：“我们的军队都已经垮了，不可能再调来打仗了。”于是就没听他儿子的话。这时朝廷的将领弓高侯韩颓当给胶西王送来一封信说：“我奉皇帝的命令来讨伐坏人，凡是投降的一律免罪，还享受他原来的爵位；凡是不投降的就全部消灭之。您准备何去何从，请即早回答，我要根据你的意向采取行动。”胶西王一听，赶紧赤着脊梁跪到了韩颓当的军营叩头请罪，他说：“我过去没有认真地遵守法纪，使百姓们受了惊吓，而且还害得您大老远地往我们这个穷国跑一趟，现在我请您把我剁成肉酱。”韩颓当列好军队手执金鼓见他说道：“你发动这场战争可多受累了，我想听听你发兵的理由。”胶西王叩头向前爬着说：“就因为晁错在朝廷里当政，他随便改变高皇帝的法令，侵夺诸侯们的地盘。我们认为他的做法是不对的，怕他把整个的天下搞坏，我们七国所以联合发兵，目的就是为了杀晁错。现在听说晁错已经被杀了，我们几个国家情愿收兵休战。”韩颓当说：“如果你们只是认为晁错不好，为什么不去对皇上说?没有皇上的命令和兵符，你们就敢擅自发兵去围攻一个坚守正义的国家，可见你们的目的根本不是只为了杀晁错。”说罢拿出皇帝的诏书读给胶西王听。读罢，对胶西王说：“请你自己看着办吧。”胶西王说：“我们的确是死有余辜。”说罢自杀而死。他的母亲和儿子也都一起自杀。胶东王、蓄川王、济南王也都先后自杀，这三个国家的封号一齐废除，领土收回朝廷。郦寄率军围攻赵国，攻了十个月才攻下来，赵王刘遂自杀。济北王由于被他的郎中令劫持未能造反，所以获得赦免，只是把他改封到了蓄川。

这次造反，是吴王刘濞首先带头，他一起领着吴国和楚国的军队，又联合了齐国和赵国。结果正月起兵，到三月他们的主要力量就全都被打败了，只剩下赵国是最后被攻破的。叛乱平定后，朝廷又立了楚元王的小儿子平陆侯刘礼为楚王，以继承楚元王之后。改封汝南王刘非到吴国原来的地方，另起国号为江都。

太史公说：刘濞之所以能被封王，是由于他父亲刘仲被贬去了王爵。刘濞在吴国能减轻百姓们的赋税，能得到士民们的拥戴支持，而且还能独享着富饶的铜山和海盐的出产。刘濞的反心，是从他的儿子被杀引起的。为争一盘棋的输赢而辗转导致了后来的叛乱，最后把一个封国彻底送掉了。而且他还勾结着越国来打自己的宗族，最后落了个彻底灭亡。晁错能够为国家作长远考虑，这是很好的，结果却招致了一场大祸害了自己。袁盎玩弄权术，巧语如簧，开头受到宠用，后来也落了个狼狈逃窜，差点儿被吴人所杀。古时候封诸侯最大的也不能超过纵横百里，而其中的名山大川还仍归朝廷管辖。俗话说：“不要亲信外民族，不要疏远自己的骨肉。”这些话大概就是指着刘濞这种人说的吧?俗话还说：“不要带头给人家出什么主意，弄不好自己反而要倒霉。”这大概就是指袁盎、晁错这种人说的吧!</div>

          <div class="txt">Liu Bi, prince of Wu, was the son of Emperor Gaozu's elder brother Liu Zhong. In the seventh year of the reign of the First Emperor,' after he had pacified the empire he made Liu Zhong prince of Dai. Then the Huns attacked Dai and Liu Zhong, unable to defend it, abandoned his principality and fled to Luoyang to throw himself on the mercy of the emperor. Since they were the same flesh and blood, the emperor could not bring himself to exact the fullegal penalty but merely deposed Liu Zhong and made him marquis of Heyang. In the autumn of the eleventh year of the First Emperor, Ying Bu, prince of Huainan, rebelled, annexed Jing in the east, seized its troops and crossed west over the River Huai to attack Chu.Emperor Gaozu himself led the army to suppress the revolt. Liu Zhong's son Liu Bi, marquis of Pei, was twenty at this time and a brave fighter. He joined the expedition as a cavalry officer and helped to defeat Ying Bu's army at Kuaiji west of Qi,putting Ying Bu to flight. LiuJia, the prince of Jing, had been killed by Ying Bu and left no heir. The men of Wu and Kuaiji were reckless and given to violence and the emperor was concerned that they had no strong prince to control them. Since his own sons were too young, while in Pei he made Liu Bi the prince of Wu to govern its three provinces and fifty-three cities. After Liu Bi had accepted the official seal, Emperor Gaozu sent for him and examined his features. "This man has the face of a rebel!" he exclaimed and regretted his decision. But since the appointment was already made he patted Liu Bion the back and said, "Within fifty years there will be a rising in the southeast—will that be your

During the reigns of Emperor Hui and Empress Lü,²order was newly restored to the empire and the princes were busy pacifying their people.Wu had mountains rich in copper at Yuzhang,and Liu Bi gath- ered fugitives from justice and brigands from all sides to mint money and boil sea water to extract salt.Since no taxes were imposed on these occupations,his principality soon became rich.

During the reign of Emperor Wen,³Liu Bi's son went to court, where he drank and played checkers with the crown prince.The prince of Wu's tutors, all of whom came from Chu, were reckless arrogant men, and one day he disputed so rudely over the score that the crown prince struck him with the checker-board and killed him. His body was sent home for burial to Wu. “The whole empire belongs to the clan of Liu!” declared Liu Bi angrily. “Since he died in Chang'an, why not bury him in Chang'an? Why must he be buried here?" He sent the body back to the capital for burial. After this, Liu Bi gradually stopped showing the respect due from a vassal and, pleading illness ,absented himself from court. The authorities knew this was because of the death of his son. Having ascertained that he was not ill at all, they arrested and cross-examined all envoys from Wu. Then the prince of Wu, in his alarm, started plotting seriously. Later he sent someone else to pay the autumn homage in his place. The envoy from Wu, questioned by the emperor, confessed, "The prince is not actually ill but is pleading sickness because so many of his envoys have been arrested and tried. Peering too closely at fish in deep waters will only lead to trouble. The prince began by feigning illness, but since that was discovered and pressure applied he is growing more and more desperate.Fear of punishment may lead him to some folly. But if you will overlook the past, he can make a fresh start." Then the emperor pardoned the envoy and sent him back with a low table and a walking-stick as gifts for the prince of Wu, implying that he was too old to come to court. And thanks to this lenient treatment, the prince abandoned his schemes. At the same time, be- cause his principality produced salt and copper, the people were exempt from taxes. Compulsory labour exemptions were sold at a fair price, while at certain times each year the prince recruited able men and rewarded deserving villages. And when other provinces or principalities sent men to arrest fugitives there, he refused to hand them over. So it went on for forty years and more, and the people of Wu were devoted to their prince.

Chao Cuo, the imperial crown prince's favoured chamberlain, several times pointed out the faults of the prince of Wu and urged that his territory be reduced. He presented memorials on this subject to Emperor Wen, but the emperor was too lenient to punish the prince, who as a result became more insubordinate every day. When Emperor Jing ascended the throne,4 Chao Cuo was made grand secretary. He advised the new emperor saying," When Emperor Gaozu first restored peace to the empire he gave large fiefs to his kinsmen because he had few brothers and his sons were still children. Thus Prince Daohui of Qi, his son by a concubine, ruled over seventy cities; Prince Yuan of Chu, a half brother, had over forty cities; Liu Bi, his elder brother's son, had over fifty. These three sons of concubines had half the empire between them. "The prince of Wu,embittered by his son's death, absented him- self from court on the pretext of illness, and according to established law he should have been punished. But Emperor Wen in his clemency gave him a low table and walking-stick instead. Such good treatment should have made him mend his ways, yet he is growing more insubordinate. He mints money in the mountains, boils sea water to extract salt, and has gathered fugitives from all parts of the land to plot treason. He will revolt whether you cut down his fief or not. If you do, his revolt will come sooner and cause less damage. If you do not, his revolt will come later and the damage will be much greater.” In the winter of the third year of Emperor Jing, the prince of Chu came to court and Chao Cuo urged that he be executed because previously, when mourning for Empress Bo, he had been guilty of illicit intercourse while living in mourning quarters. The emperor com- muted his punishment into confiscation of the province of Donghai. At the same time he deprived the prince of Wu of the provinces of Yuzhang and Kuaiji. Two years previously the prince of Zhao had lost the province of Hejian for some offence, while Prince Ang of Jiaoxi had been deprived of six counties on account of his illegal sale of ranks.

While the ministers at court were discussing the diminution of Wu's territory,the prince of Wu, fearing that he would soon have no fief left, began to make plans for revolt. He could think of no worthy confederate among the feudal lords, but having heard that the prince of Jiaoxi was bold, spirited, warlike and feared byall the other principalities of Qi, he sent his minister Ying Gao to win him over. Ying Gao took nothing in writing but delivered a verbal message. “The prince of Wu, unworthy as he is, has long been worried,” he said. “He dares not leave his territory but has sent me to convey his greetings to you." “What are his instructions?” asked the prince of Jiaoxi. "Our present emperor favours wicked men and is surrounded by evil ministers," said Ying Gao." He thinks only of trifles and gives ear to slander. Laws are arbitrarily rescinded, land is seized from the feudal lords, more demands are made every day and more innocent citizens punished. Country folk have a saying, Once the husk is licked away it is the turn of the rice'. The princes of Wu and Jiaoxi are famed through- out the land, but once an investigation begins you will lose your freedom of action. For more than twenty years the prince of Wu has not been well enough to pay homage at court. He fears suspicion may fall on him and he will be unable to clear himself. Even cringing and cowering may not procure him a pardon. It is said that Your Highness has had some trouble over the sale of ranks, while other nobles have been deprived of territory for even less than that. And loss of territory may not be the end.” "That is so," said the prince of Jiaoxi.“What would you advise?” "Those who hate the same things help each other, those who love the same things hold together," said Ying Gao." Those with common sympathies cooperate, those with common desires seek the same goal, and those with common interests die for each other. The prince of Wu believes that he has the same cause for anxiety as Your Highness. The time has come, he thinks, to stand up for the right and risk your lives to rid the empire of calamity. Do you approve of this plan?” "How dare I contemplate such a thing?" exclaimed the prince taken aback." If the emperor presses me hard, all I can do is to die. How can I withdraw my allegiance?” "The chief counsellor Chao Cuo is deceiving the emperor, depriving princes of their rights and debarring the loyal and good from government posts. Feeling is running high at court and all the princes have rebellion in their hearts. Matters have come to a head now. Comets have appeared and there have been plagues of locusts. This is a time which comes only once in ten thousand generations: it is in troubled days like these that sages arise. The prince of Wu means to rid the court of Chao Cuo and then journey in your train through the provinces. Wherever you go men will surrender to you, and every city you want to take will fall, for no one in the empire will dare to resist, Your Majesty has only to give the word and the prince of Wu, leading the prince of Chu, will seize the Hangu Pass, guard the granaries of Xingyang and Aocang, hold back the soldiers of Han (206B.C.-8A.D.) and prepare quarters in readiness for you and your guard, If you will honour us by taking part, sir, the whole empire can be conquered and divided be-tween you and the prince of Wu, Is this not feasible?”“Very well,’ said the prince of Jiaoxi. After Ying Gao returned to report this, the prince of Wu, still afraid that the other might not join him, went in person to reach an agreement with the prince of Jiaoxi.

Some ministers of the prince of jiaoxi learned of this plot and advised against it, saying, “Allegiance to one emperor is best of all. Now you mean to march west with the prince of Wu but, even if you succeed, trouble will follow when you both contend for power. 'The lands of the princes make up less than one-fifth of the empire. It would not be wise to revolt and cause anxiety to the empress dowager.” Instead of listening to them, however, the prince sent envoys to enlist the support of the princes of Qi, Zichuan, Jiaodong, Jinan and Jibei, all of whom consented to join the conspiracy. “Prince Jing of Chengyang showed his loyalty in the overthrow of the Lü clan,” they said. “'He would not take part. When all is done we shall share the empire with him.

The princes lived in fear because of recent punishments or the confiscation of their land, and greatly hated Chao Cuo. When the or-der came that the provinces of Kuaiji and Yuzhang were to be taken from Wu, the prince of Wu took the lead in calling out his troops. In the first month all Han officers from the two thousand picuis rank downwards were killed in Wu and Jiaoxi. The same was done in jiaodong, Zichuan, jinan, Chu and Zhao, after which the rebels marched west. 'The prince of Qi, repenting, went back on his word and took his own life by drinking poison. The wall of the prince of Jibei's capital was under repair, and the chief of his palace guard forcibly restrained him from sending out his troops. With the prince of ]iaoxi in command, the forces of Jiaodong, Zichuan and ]inan besieged Linzi, The prince of Zhao also rebelled and secretly sent for the Huns to join his forces.

As soon as the seven princes rose in revolt, the prince of Wu mobilized his troops and issued this proclamation: “I am sixty-two, yet I shall lead the troops in person. My youngest son is fourteen but he too will march in the vanguard. Let all men no older than myself and no younger than my son take up arms!’’ He raised an army of more than two hundred thousand and sent envoys south to the Minyue and Dongyue tribes,' and Dongyue dispatched troops to join him.

The rebellion broke out at Guangling in the first month of the third year of Emperor Jing, The prince of Wu crossed the River Huai to the west and joined the army of Chu, He sent envoys to the other princes bearing this letter: Liu Bi, prince of Wu, sends his greetings to the princes of Jiaoxi, Jiaodong, Zichuan, jinan, Zhao, Chu, Huainan, Hengshan and Lujiang, and the two sons of the late prince of Changsha, Han has evil ministers who do not serve the empire but seize the lands of the princes and arrest and try their envoys, not showing the respect due to kinsmen of the imperial clan of Liu, The good ministers of the last reign are thrust aside while scoundrels are given posts, causing confusion throughout the land and endangering the state. Since the emperor, in bad health and infirm of purpose, is unable to see the true state of affairs, I am raising troops to destroy the evil-doers. I hope for guidance from you. Although my principality is small, it covers three thousand square/ of land. Although my people are few, I can gather half a million picked troops. The chieftains of Nanyue, whom I have aided for thirty years and more, have acceded to my request and placed their troops under my command, giving me an additional three hundred thousand men. Unworthy as I am, I would like to follow the lead of the other princes. Since Nanyue lies next to Changsha, the sons of the late prince of Changsha should pacify the land to their north, then march west to Hanzhong and Shu. The chieftains of Dongyue, the prince of Chu and the three princes of Huainan, Hengshan and Lujiang, should march west with me. The princes of Qi and Zhao should pacify Hejian and Henei, then proceed through the Linjin Pass or join my forces at Luoyang. Since the princes of Yan and Zhao have an alliance with the Hunnish chief, let the prince of Yan advance north to conquer Dai and Yunzhong, then lead the Hunnish hordes through the Xiao Pass. We shall enter Chang'an to rectify the emperor's mistakes and preserve the ancestral temples of the founder of the dynasty. I trust all these princes will take action! The son of Prince Yuan of Chu and the three princes of Huainan, Hengshan and Lujiang have not bathed for ten years and more, so deep is their hatred and longing for revenger I have not ventured to agree tot heir wish without first obtaining the other princes’ consent, But if the princes will preserve the descendants of the dead, protect the weak and fight against tyranny to safeguard the Liu clan, this will satisfy the longing of the people. Although my principality is poor, I have dressed and eaten frugally to lay by money, prepare arms and accumulate grain for thirty years and more without a break, I hope the other princes will make use of this. The reward for killing or capturing a marshal shall be five thousand catties of gold and a fief of ten thousand households; for a general, three thousand catties of gold and five thousand households; for a lieutenant-general, two thousand catties and two thousand households; for an officer of the two thousand piculs rank, a thousand catties and a thousand for an officer of the one thousand piculs rank five hundred catties and five hundred households. And all these men will receive the title of marquis. The reward for coming over to our side with an army of ten thousand men or a city of ten thousand house. holds shall be the same as for the capture of a marshal; for five thou- sand men or five thousand households, the same as for the capture of a general; for three thousand men or three thousand households, the same as for the capture of a lieutenant-general; for a thousand men or a thousand households, the same as for the capture of an officer of the two thousand piculs rank. Junior officers who come over shall receive gold and rank according to their merit, Other rewards shall be double the conventional standard, and those already awarded ranks and fiefs shall receive new rewards over and above what they have. I hope the princes will announce this to their officers, for I shall not go back on my word, I have funds not only in Wu but all over the empire, an inexhaustible supply even if the princes draw on it day and night, If anyone deserves a reward, you have only to let me know and I shall send it. l proclaim this respectfully.

When this letter announcing the seven princes' rebellion reached the emperor, he sent the Grand Marshal Zhou Yafu, marquis of Tiao, at the head of thirty-six generals to attack Wu and Chu, i ]i, marquis of Quzhou, was sent to attack Zhao, General Luan Bu to attack Qi, and Marshal Dou Ying to station troops at Xingyang to await the armies of Qi and Zhao.

The report of the rebellion had arrived but troops had not yet been dispatched when Dou Ying, before setting out, recommended Yuan Ang, the former prime minister to the prince of Wu who was then living in retirement. The emperor sent for Yuan Ang, who arrived as Emperor Jing and Chao Cuo were discussing the disposition of troops and the army supplies. “You were once the prime minister of Wu,” said the emperor to Yuan Ang, “What do you know of their marshal Tian Lubo? And what do you think of this revolt of Wu and Chu?” “There is no need to worry,” Yuan Ang replied, “They will soon be defeated.” “The prince of Wu has minted money in the mountains, extracted salt from the sea and attracted useful men from all over the land,” said the emperor, “Would a white-haired old man have started this revolt unless he had a foolproof plan? How can you dismiss it as nothing?” “True, Wu makes a lot of money out of copper and salt,” said Yuan Ang “But what good men has the prince been able to attract? If he had any, they would have advised him to do what is right, not to rebel. He has simply assembled some scoundrels, fugitives from justice and criminals who coin counterfeit money. That is why they have encouraged him to revolt.” “Let Yuan Ang draw up a plan for us,” said Chao Cuo. “What plan do you suggest?” asked the emperor. “I would like to speak with you in private,” replied Yuan Ang. The emperor dismissed his attendants, leaving only Chao Cuo. “I have to say is for Your Majesty's ears alone,” said Yuan Ang. Then the emperor dismissed Chao Cuo, who retired to the east chamber in a rage. Asked his opinion again, Yuan Ang replied, “This letter from the princes of Wu and Chu says that all Emperor Gaozu's sons and younger brothers had fiefs until the traitor Chao Cuo accused them falsely and seized their territory. They claim that they have risen in revolt to march west and punish Chao Cuo, and that once their lands are restored they will call a halt. So the best plan now would be to execute Chao Cuo and send envoys to pardon the seven princes, returning the provinces which were taken from them. Then their troops will be called off without any bloodshed.” The emperor was silent for some time. “If that is true,” he said, “I should not grudge sacrificing a single man for the sake of the whole empire.” “Dull as I am, I have no better plan,” said Yuan Ang, “I hope you will consider it carefully.” The emperor appointed Yuan Ang as officer in charge of sacrifices, and Marquis De, the son of the prince of Wu's younger brother, as officer of the imperial clan. Yuan Ang made ready to set out on a journey. After more than ten days, the emperor ordered the military commander of the capital to summon Chao Cuo; but instead of being driven to the palace he was taken to the east market. There he was executed still wearing his court robes. Then Yuan Ang as the warden of the ancestral temples and the officer of the imperial clan with orders for the imperial kinsmen were dispatched to the prince of Wu in accordance with Yuan Ang's plan. When they reached Wu, the troops of Wu and Chu were attacking the ramparts of Liang. Marquis De, as a kinsman, was received first by the prince of Wu. He told him the emperor's decision and ordered him to bow to receive the imperial decree. But the prince of Wu, who knew that Yuan Ang had also come to persuade him, laughed and replied, “I am already the emperor of the east, Why should I bow to anyone's decree?” He refused to see Yuan Ang, but detained him in his camp and tried to force him to become his general. When Yuan Ang refused, the king had him surrounded and watched, meaning to kill him. But Yuan Ang contrived to slip out by night and escape on foot to the army of Liang, after which he went back to report to the emperor.

The marquis of Tiao, driving swiftly by six stages to the garrison at Xingyang, was delighted to meet Ju Meng at Luoyang “When the seven princes revolted, I hurried here by relay carriages, not expecting this place to have held out,"’ he said. “T feared the feudal lords had got hold of you, but I find you have not moved. With Xingyang in my hands, we have nothing to fear from the east, "He proceeded to Huaiyang and asked an army tribune named Teng, a former protégé of his father, the marquis of Jiang, what strategy he advised. “The army of Wu has a striking force hard to resist, that of Chu is lightly equipped with small staying power," said Teng, “Your best plan is to lead your men northeast to defend Changyi, abandoning Iiang to Wu, for then the prince of Wu is bound to attack it with all his might. Meanwhile from behind deep trenches and high ramparts, you can send a light detachment to block the junction of the Huai and Si Rivers, cutting Wu's supply route. When the forces of Wu and Liang have worn each other out and the rebels’ grain is finished, you can attack the exhausted enemy in full strength and Wu's defeat is certain.“ Very good," said the marquis of Tiao and adopted this plan, building strong defences south of Changyi and sending a light detachment to cut Wu's supply route.

When the prince of Wu rose in revolt he appointed his minister Tian Lubo as grand marshal, ''If we advance west with our whole body of troops without making any surprise attacks, it will be hard to succeed," said 'Tian Lubo. “et me lead fifty thousand men along the Yangtse and Huai Rivers to conquer Huainan and Changsha, and thenproceed through the Wu Pass to rejoin your forces. Then we could take the enemy by surprise. The prince of Wu's son objected, however, saying, “Now that you have revolted openly, sir, it would be unwise to entrust your troops toothers lest they in turn rise against you. Besides, when a man goes off atthe head of troops, all sorts of things, either good or bad, may happen. Meanwhile our strength would be weakened.’ So the prince of Wu rejected Tian Lubo's plan.

A young general of Wu named Huan advised the prince, saying "Our army is mainly infantry, well suited to mountainous terrain, while the army of Han with all its war chariots and cavalry fights better on the plain. I Suggest that when cities on the way prove hard to take, we simply abandon the attack and march swiftly west to seize the arsenals Luoyang and feed our men with grain from Aocang, blocking the mountain passes by the river while you command the other princes. Then you will have the empire in your hands without even entering the Pass. But if you advance slowly, stopping to take cities, the war chariots and cavalry of Han will charge across the plains of Chu and Liang, and all will be lost.” The prince consulted older generals, who said, “This is the hare-brained scheme of a young man who does not think seriously.” So the prince did not take General Huan's advice.

Zhou Qiu asked to see the prince and said, '' am not able enough to serve in this campaign and would not presume to ask for a command; but if you will give me one of the credentials used by the Han envoys. I swear to repay the gratitude I owe you.” 'The prince gave him the credential and Zhou Qiu rode off that same night to Xiapi. News of the revolt had reached Xiapi and its cities were being defended, He went to the government hostel and summoned the magistrate. As soon as the magistrate arrived, he charged him with some crime and ordered his followers to kill him. Then Zhou Qiu sent for his brothers and the chief officers whom he knew, and told them, “The rebel troops of Wu are on their way here and, once they arrive, they will butcher the people of Xiapi in the time it takes for a meal, By surrendering now, you can save your families and men of ability will be ennobled.” These men went to spread the word, and Xiapi surrendered. In one night Zhou Qiu had won over thirty thousand men. Sending a messenger to report this to the prince, he led his troops north to conquer other cities. By the time he reached Chengyang he had over a hundred thousand men and with these he routed the army of the commander of Chengyang, Then word came that the prince of Wu had been defeated and fled and, knowing that he could not go on alone, Zhou Qiu led his troops back towards Xiapi. Before he reached it, however, an ulcer developed on his back and he died.

In the middle of the second month, when the prince of Wu's army was routed and put to flight, the emperor issued this order to his generals: We have heard that Heaven blesses those who do good but visits calamity upon wrong-doers, Emperor Gaozu himself honoured achievement and virtue and set up the princes. When Prince You and Prince Daohui had no heirs, Emperor Wu took pity on them and made Prince You's son Sui and Prince Daohui's son Ang princes, so that they might care for their ancestral temples as the vassals of Han. He was as virtuous as heaven and earth, and as discerning as the sun and moon. But Liu Bi, the prince of Wu, flouted virtue and justice by attracting fugitives and evil-doers from all parts of the empire, debasing the currency and, on the pretext of illness, absenting himself from court for more than twenty years. The authorities urged more than once that he should be punished, but Emperor Wen pardoned him, hoping that he would mend his ways and do what was right. Now he has rebelled with Prince Wu of Chu, Prince Sui of Zhao, Prince Ang of Jiaoxi, Principia of Jinan, Prince &ian of Zichuan and Prince Xiongqu of Jiaodong, lawlessly plotting treason. He has raised arms to endanger the imperial house, killed ministers and Han envoys, oppressed the people, murdered the innocent, burned and destroyed men's houses, razed their graves and resorted to violence of every description. Ang and others have committed yet more heinous crimes, burning the ancestral temples and looting the ceremonial costumes and vessels. We are deeply grieved. Dressed in plain clothes we have withdrawn from the main court while our generals urge their officers to attack these rebels. Those who strike deep into rebel territory and kill or capture many foes will be performing meritorious services. As for the captives, all rebel officers above the three hundred piculs rank must be put to death without mercy. Any man who dares to question this decree or fails to carry it out shall be cut in two at the waist.

When the prince of Wu had first crossed the River Huai, he stormed Jibi in the west with the prince of Chu and, flushed with victory, their army swept irresistibly forward, so that Prince Xiao of Liang was afraid. He sent six generals out to intercept them, but two of these were defeated and their men fled back to Liang. The prince of Liang sent envoys to the marquis of Tiao with repeated requests for help, but the marquis made no response. Finally the prince sent an envoy to condemn the marquis to the emperor, who ordered him to go to the aid of Liang. Still the marquis, acting on expediency, did not dispatch his forces, 'T'he prince of Liang gave the command to Han Anguo and Zhang Yu, the younger brother of the minister of Chu who died after remonstrating with his prince, and they inflicted several defeats on Wu. The troops of Wu wanted to proceed west, but in face of Liang's stubborn resistance they dared not do so. Instead they marched against the marquis of Tiao at Xiayi, but his army remained behind the ramparts and would not give battle, till Wu's supplies ran out and its men were hungry. They challenged the enemy time and again and one night made a feint of attacking from the southeast. The marquis promptly prepared for an attack on the northwest, and when the u troops did attack from that direction they were routed, Many of them died of starvation, others mutinied and scattered. The prince of Wu with a few thousand of his best fighters escaped at night and crossed the Yangtse River, fleeing to Dantu in the land of Dongyue, Dongyue had more than ten thousand troops, and he meant to rally his scattered forces there, But the court sent envoys with gifts to persuade the chieftain of Dongyue to trick the prince of Wu. When he came out to review his troops, spearsmen set on him and killed him. His head was put in a casket and sent by post carriage to court. His two sons, Zihua and Ziju, fled to Minyue. After the prince of Wu abandoned his army and fled, his men were dispersed and little by little surrendered to the prince of Liang and the grand marshal. The forces of Prince Wu of Chu were also defeated and he committed suicide.

sons, Zihua and Ziju, fled to Minyue. After the prince of Wu abandoned his army and fled, his men were dispersed and little by little surrendered to the prince of [iang and the grand marshal. The forces of Prince Wu of Chu were also defeated and he committed suicide. The three princes of Jiaoxi, Jiaodong and Zichuan besieged Linziin Qi for three months but failed to take it, When government reinforcements arrived, they withdrew to their own principalities. The prince of ]iaoxi bared his left atm, sat on a straw mat and drank nothing but water to apologize to the queen dowager. His son De said, “Han's army has come a long way and seems exhausted, Why not launch a surprise attack? Let me rally all our remaining troops to fight them. If we lose, we can still escape by way of the sea. “My troops are too demoralized to be of any use," replied the prince and he ignored this proposal. Han Tuidang, the marquis of Gonggao and a Han general, sent this letter to the prince: “The emperor has ordered me to punish malefactors. Those who submit will be pardoned and their rank restored; those who refuse to surrender will be destroyed, What does Your Highness intend to do? I am waiting for your decision,’The prince bared his left arm and kowtowed before the Han ramparts to beg for an interview, “'I have been remiss in observing the law and alarmed the people, putting you to the trouble of coming all this way to my poor principality," he said. “I beg to be punished by being cut into small pieces. The marquis, holding a drum and gong, received him. “Your Highness is averse to fighting,’’ he said, “May I ask why you rose in arms?’The prince bowed his head and, advancing on his knees, replied." We thought it unjust that Chao Cuo, who was trusted by the emperor should alter Emperor Gaozu's laws and seize the lands of the princes. We seven princes were afraid that he would destroy the empire, so werose in arms to punish him, Now that we hear Chao Cuo has been executed, we have withdrawn our troops,” “If you thought that Chao Cuo was wrong, why did you not report it to the emperor?” the general asked, “Instead you mobilized troops with your tiger tally and attacked a loyal prince without the emperor's order, Judging by your actions, your aim was not to punish Chao Cuo." He took out the imperial decree, read it to the prince and said, “You must decide for yourself what action to take. “Even death cannot atone for my crime,’ said the prince of Jiaoxi. He committed suicide, and so did the queen dowager and the crown prince. The princes of ]iaodong, Zichuan and Jinan all took their own lives. Their principalities were abolished and came under central government jurisdiction. After a siege of ten months, General Ii took the capital of Zhao and the prince of Zhao committed suicide. Since the prince of ]ibei had been forced by the other princes to join the revolt, his life was spared but he was removed to be the prince of Zichuan.

The prince of Wu had been the first to rebel, be had commanded the army of Chu as well as his own and had made the agreement with the princes of Qi and Zhao. 'The rebellion broke out in the first month, but by the third all rebel forces were suppressed except for those of Zhao, which were defeated later, i, marquis of Pinglu and the youngest son of Prince Yuan of Chu, was made the king of Chu to carty on the royal line, Prince Fei of Runan was removed to rule over the former principality of Wu with the title of prince of Jiangdu.

'The Grand Historian comments: 'T'he prince of Wu became prince as result of his father's loss of territory: He succeeded in lowering taxes and winning the hearts of his people by his monopoly of copper and salt, His son's death was the root of his disaffection, and that quarrel over a game score ended in his utter ruin, He allied with the tribes-men of Yue against his own clan, and came to an evil end, Chao Cuo showed foresight in affairs of state but met with personal calamity.Yuan Ang was trusted thanks to his eloquence, but the favour he first enjoyed ended in disgrace, So we see why no feudal lord of old could have a fief exceeding a hundred h or possession of mountains and coastland, And it was said, “Do not make friends with the barbarians while keeping at a distance from kinsmen,", This applies, surely, to the prince of Wu, “Do not try to rise above others, or you will suffer for it." This applies, does it not, to Chao Cuo and Yuan Ang?</div>
