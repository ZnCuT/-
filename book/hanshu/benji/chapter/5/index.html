          <div class="txt">孝成皇帝，是汉元帝的太子。母亲是王皇后。

元帝在太子宫时，（成帝）出生在甲观的画堂，成为世系中的嫡皇孙。

汉宣帝喜爱他，给他取字为太孙，常常把他放在自己身边。

三岁时宣帝去世，元帝即位，成帝成为太子。

成年后喜好儒家经典，心胸宽广，为人宽厚，谨慎细心。

起初居住在桂宫，元帝曾经紧急召见他，太子走出龙楼门，不敢横穿皇帝专用的驰道，向西走到直城门，得到允许后才横穿，然后返回进入作室门。

元帝嫌他来晚了，询问原因，太子把情况如实回答。

元帝非常高兴，于是发布命令，允许太子横穿驰道。

后来（太子）喜好饮酒，热衷于宴饮作乐，元帝认为他没有才能。

而定陶恭王有才能技艺，他的母亲傅昭仪又受到宠爱，元帝因此常常有立恭王为继承人的想法。

下诏说：“此前火灾降落在祖庙，彗星出现在东方，刚登基就出现过失，罪过多么大啊！

《尚书》说：‘古代的贤王遇到灾异就纠正自己的行事。’各位公卿要勤勉努力，带头引导百官，辅助我做得不足之处。

九月，下诏说：“此前郡国遭受水灾，冲走和淹死百姓，多到上千人。

下诏说：“听说上天生育众多百姓，不能互相治理，为他们设立君主来统辖治理他们。

君主的治国之道得当，那么草木、昆虫都能各得其所；君主没有德行，天地就会显现谴责的迹象，灾异多次发生，来告诫治国不当。

我接触治国之道的时间很短，举措不当，于是戊申日发生日食、地震，我非常恐惧。

公卿们各自思考我的过失，清楚地陈述出来。‘你们不要当面顺从，退下后又有别的议论。’

所以《尚书》说‘百姓繁衍，四季和谐’，表明以阴阳为根本。

如今公卿大夫有的不相信阴阳，轻视小看它，所上奏请求的事情多违背时令政务。

否则学者就没有可传述的（知识），被下属轻视，这不是尊崇道德的做法。

先帝鼓励农业，减轻租税，优待努力耕作的人，让他们与孝悌的人同等对待。

近来，百姓更加懒惰懈怠，从事农业这个根本的人少，趋向商业这个末业的人多，将用什么来纠正这种情况呢？

正当春耕生产的时候，命令二千石官员勉励督促农桑，出入田间小路，招致慰劳百姓。

下诏说：“古代选拔贤人，采纳他们的言论，通过功绩明确考察他们。

所以官府没有荒废的事务，民间没有隐逸的人才，教化流布，风雨及时，各种谷物成熟，百姓安居乐业，都安康太平。

我继承大业十多年，多次遭受水、旱、疫病灾害，百姓屡次困于饥寒，却希望礼义兴起，难道不是很困难吗！

我既然没有办法引导（百姓），帝王之道日益衰落，想来是招贤选士的道路阻塞不通，还是举荐的人没有得到合适的人选呢？

举荐敦厚有德行、能直言进谏的人，希望听到恳切的言论和美好的谋略，匡正我的不足。”

鸿嘉四年春正月，下诏说：“多次告诫有关部门，务必实行宽大政策，禁止苛刻残暴，到现在仍不改正。

一人有罪，整个宗族被拘捕，农民失去本业，怨恨的人很多，伤害了和谐之气，导致水旱灾害，关东流亡的人很多，青州、幽州、冀州地区尤其严重，我非常痛心。

没有听说在位的官员有怜悯的，谁该帮助我担忧这些呢！

已经派遣使者巡视郡国。遭受灾害达到十分之四以上的，百姓资产不满三万的，不要征收租赋。

拖欠的借贷没有缴纳的，都不再收取。流亡的百姓想要入关的，立即登记接纳。所到的郡国，要谨慎地以礼相待，务必使他们能够保全性命。希望符合我的心意。”

秋季七月，下诏说：“我持守德行不坚定，谋划不能充分听取臣下意见，错误地听从将作大匠解万年说昌陵三年可以建成。

修建了五年，中陵、司马殿门内还没有动工。

天下财力空虚，百姓疲劳，从外地运来的土壤疏松不好，最终不能建成。

我想到这些困难，悲痛伤心。‘有过错而不改正，这才是过错。’

现停止修建昌陵，并且原来的陵墓所在地不要迁移官吏百姓，让天下人不要有动摇的心思。”

公卿告诫百官，深入思考上天的告诫，有可以减省以便利安定百姓的，分条上奏。所赈济借贷给贫民的（财物），不要收回。”

又说：“关东地区连年歉收，官吏百姓出于道义收养贫民、交纳谷物帮助官府赈济的，已经赏赐了价值，其中达到一百万以上的，加赐爵位右更，想做官的，补任三百石官职，已是官吏的，提升两级。

三十万以上的，赐爵位五大夫，官吏也提升两级，百姓补任郎官。

十万以上的，家庭免除租赋三年。一万钱以上的，免除一年。”

冬季十一月，成帝驾临雍地，祭祀五畤。

十二月，下诏说：“先前将作大匠解万年明知昌陵地势低下，不能作为长久居住的陵墓，却上奏请求营建，修建城郭邑落，随意进行精巧的设计，堆积泥土增高地基，多征收赋税徭役，兴起急促的劳役。

服役的刑徒遭受苦难，死亡的人接连不断，百姓疲惫到极点，天下财力匮乏。

常侍王闳先前担任大司农中丞时，多次上奏说昌陵不可能建成。

侍中卫尉淳于长多次进言应该及早停止，迁移住户返回原来的地方。

我根据淳于长的话下达王闳的奏章，参与商议的公卿都赞同淳于长的计策。

淳于长首先提出正确的策略，王闳主管减省大量费用，百姓因此安宁。

王闳先前已被赐爵关内侯，黄金一百斤。现赐淳于长爵关内侯，食邑一千户，王闳五百户。

解万年奸佞邪恶不忠诚，毒害流传给百姓，天下人怨恨，到现在没有平息，虽然受到赦免的命令，也不适合居住在京城。将解万年迁徙到敦煌郡。”

这一年，御史大夫王骏去世。

永始三年春正月乙卯日是月末，发生日食。

夏季四月癸未日，长乐宫临华殿、未央宫东司马门都发生火灾。

六月甲午日，霸陵园的门阙发生火灾。放出杜陵中那些未曾侍奉过皇帝的宫女，让她们回家。

下诏说：“先前，京城发生地震，火灾多次降临，我非常恐惧。有关部门要尽心明确地回答这其中的过失，我将亲自阅览。”

又说：“圣明的君王明确礼制来排列尊卑等级，区分车马服饰来彰显有德行的人，即使有财富，但没有相应的尊贵地位，也不能超越制度，所以百姓勉力践行，崇尚道义而轻视利益。

如今世俗的奢侈僭越没有极限，没有满足的时候。公卿列侯、亲属近臣，是天下人效法的榜样，却没有听说他们修养自身、遵循礼制、同心协力为国分忧的。

有的甚至奢侈逸乐，致力于扩大宅第，修建园林池塘，多收养奴婢，穿着绫罗绸缎，设置钟鼓，配备歌女乐师，车马服饰、嫁娶、埋葬都超越制度。

官吏百姓羡慕效仿，逐渐形成习俗，却希望百姓节俭，家家富足，难道不是很困难吗！

《诗经》不是说吗？‘威严显赫的太师尹，百姓都看着你。’要告诫有关部门，逐步禁止这种风气。

青色、绿色是百姓常穿的颜色，暂且不要禁止。列侯近臣，要各自反省改正。司隶校尉监察那些不改正的人。”

秋季七月，有彗星出现在东井星区。

下诏说：“先前，日食、星陨，上天显示谴责的迹象，重大的异常现象接连不断。在位的官员沉默不言，很少有忠直的言论。

如今彗星出现在东井星区，我非常恐惧。公卿大夫、博士、议郎各自要尽心，思考变革的意图，依据经书明确回答，不要有所避讳。

和内地郡国各自举荐方正能直言极谏的一人，北部边境二十二郡各自举荐勇猛懂兵法的一人。”

没有得到上天的福佑，至今没有继承人，天下人没有可寄托心意的对象。

考察古今往事的警戒，祸乱的萌芽，都由此产生。

定陶王刘欣对我来说如同儿子，慈爱仁厚孝顺，可以继承天命，延续祭祀。现立刘欣为皇太子。

封中山王的舅舅谏大夫冯参为宜乡侯，增加中山国三万户封地，以安慰他的心。

赏赐诸侯王、列侯黄金，天下应继承父业的人爵位，三老、孝悌、力田丝帛，各有等级差别。”

又说：“听说帝王必定保存前两朝帝王的后代，用来贯通三统。

从前成汤接受天命，（商朝）被列为三代之一，但祭祀已经废止断绝。

考察寻求他的后代，孔吉是合适的人选。封孔吉为殷绍嘉侯。”

四月己卯日，安葬在延陵。

赞曰：我的姑姑进入后宫成为婕妤，父亲、儿子、兄弟在宫中侍奉，多次对我说：

成帝善于修饰仪容举止，登上车驾时端正站立，不回头看，不急促说话，不亲自用手指点，临朝时深沉静默，尊严如同神明，可以说是有天子端庄的仪容啊！

博览古今典籍，能够容纳接受直言。公卿称职，奏议值得记述。

遭遇承平时代，上下和睦。然而沉湎于酒色，赵氏在宫内作乱，外戚专擅朝政，说起这些真令人叹息。

建始年间以来，王氏开始执掌国家命运，哀帝、平帝在位时间短暂，王莽于是篡夺皇位，大概他的权势和福分是逐渐形成的啊！</div>

          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng was the Heir-apparent of Emperor Yüan. His mother was entitled the Empress [née] Wang.

While Emperor Yüan [was living] in the Heir-apparent's Palace, [the future Emperor Ch'eng] was born in the Painted Hall of the First Lodge. He was [called] the Imperial Grandson Who is the Heir by the First Wife.

Emperor Hsüan loved him, named him the Heir-apparent of the Heir-apparent, and constantly kept him about himself.

When he was in his third year, Emperor Hsüan died, and Emperor Yüan ascended the throne, [whereupon the future] Emperor became the Heir-apparent.

When he grew up, he loved the classics, and was large-minded and generous, circumspect and attentive.

Previously, when the Heir-apparent lived in Kuei Palace, Emperor [Yüan] once summoned him [to come] in haste. He went out of the Lung-lou Gate [to his palace], but did not dare to cross the imperial pathway, so went west to the Chih-ch'eng Gate [of the city], where it was permitted to cross [the imperial pathway]. Thereupon he crossed, returned [eastwards], and entered the Artisan's Chamber Gate [of Wei-yang Palace].

The Emperor [said] he was tardy, and asked the reason for it. [The Heir-apparent] replied, [giving] the circumstances.

and the Emperor was greatly pleased. Thereupon [the Emperor] published an ordinance, ordering that an Heir-apparent should be allowed to cross the imperial pathway.

Later, [the Heir-apparent grew] fond of wine and "took pleasure in the delights of conviviality," [so that] Emperor Yüan did not think him capable.

Moreover [Emperor Yüan's second son], King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang], showed innate ability and talents; his mother, the Brilliant Companion [née] Fu, was also loved and favored [by the Emperor]; for this reason the Emperor constantly had thoughts of wanting to make King Kung his heir.

[But] because of the Palace Attendant Shih Tan, who protected the Heir-apparent's household and effectively aided and assisted [the Heir-apparent], and because, moreover, the deceased Emperor [Hsüan] had especially loved the Heir-apparent, Emperor [Yüan] permitted him not to be dismissed.

In [the period] Ching-ning, the first year, the fifth month, Emperor Yüan died.

and in the sixth month, on [the day] chi-wei, the Heir-apparent ascended the imperial throne, presented himself in the Temple of [Emperor] Kao.

honored the [Ch'iung-ch'eng] Empress Dowager [née] Wang, entitling her the Grand Empress Dowager, [honored] the Empress [née] Wang, entitling her the Empress Dowager.

and made his eldest maternal uncle, the Palace Attendant and Commandant of the Palace Guard, the Marquis of Yang-p'ing, Wang Feng, Commander-in-chief and General-in-chief, and Intendant of Affairs of the Masters of Writing.

On [the day] yi-wei, a high official said that [to bury with the deceased Emperor his] imperial chariot, his carriages, oxen, horses, birds, and beasts was contrary to the [ancient] rites, so that it was improper to bury them [with the Emperor]. The memorial was approved.

In the seventh month, a general amnesty [was granted to] the empire.

In [the period] Chien-shih, the first year, in the spring, the first month, on [the first day], yi-ch'ou, there was a visitation [of fire] in the temple of the [Emperor's] imperial great-grandfather, the Deceased [Imperial] Father Tao, [Liu Chin].

The Chief of the Arsenal in Shang Commandery, [Liu] Liang, the younger brother of the former King of Ho-chien, [Liu Yüan], was set up as King [of Ho-chien].

A comet appeared in [the constellation] Ying-shih.

The Imperial Prison in Shang-lin [Park] was abolished.

In the second month, Yao Yin, a Chief Clerk of the General of the Right, [Wang Shang], who had been sent [as an envoy] to the Huns, and others —when they were on their way back and were a hundred-odd li from the Barrier—a fire which sprang up [in the grass] in a violent wind burnt to death [Yao] Yin and the others, seven persons [in all].

[The Emperor] granted to the vassal kings, the Lieutenant Chancellor [K'uang Heng], the generals, the marquises, the Queens Dowager, the Imperial Princesses, the Royal Princesses, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs, actual gold; to [members of] the imperial house who were in the various offices, and officials [ranking at] a thousand piculs, down to those [ranking at] two hundred piculs, together with members of the imperial house who were enregistered, the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, cash and silk, to each proportionately; and to the officials and common people of fifty households, an ox and wine.

An imperial edict said, "Recently a visitation of fire descended upon an [imperial] ancestral temple and a comet appeared in the eastern quarter [of the heavens]—the rectification [of Our government] at its inception has [shown some] defect. What calamity [could be] greater!

The Book of History says, `Verily, [when a portent occurred], the greatest kings of former [times] rectified their work.' The highest ministers should be very diligent, should lead and act as examples to the many officials, and should support Us in Our inadequacies.

exalting clemency and generosity, and making harmony and concord grow. In all these things they should `treat others as themselves' and not be exacting and oppressive.

Let a general amnesty [be granted] to the empire, so that [everyone] may secure [an opportunity] to renew himself."

[The Emperor] enfeoffed his maternal uncle, the Inspector of Officials and Imperial Household Grandee, the Kuan-nei Marquis, Wang Ch'ung, as Marquis of An-ch'eng and granted to [the Emperor's] maternal uncles, Wang T'an, [Wang] Shang, [Wang] Li, [Wang] Keng, and [Wang] Feng-shih, the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis.

In the summer, the fourth month, a yellow fog completely filled the four [quarters. The Emperor] asked the ministers and grandees widely [for an explanation, telling them] not to keep silent about anything.

In the sixth month, there were innumerable ten-thousands of blue flies, which collected on the places [for standing] at the court receptions in the Hall of Wei-yang Palace.

In the autumn, twenty-five palaces and lodges in Shang-lin [Park] that were rarely visited by the Emperor were abolished.

In the eighth month there were two moons, one above the other, that appeared at dawn in the eastern quarter.

and in the ninth month, on [the day] mou-tzu, there was a shooting star whose light lighted up the earth. It was forty or fifty feet (degrees) long, curved and sinuous in the form of a snake, and traversed [the constellation] Tzu-kung.

In the twelfth month, [places] for the suburban sacrifices [to Heaven and Earth and their rulers] were made to the south and north of Ch'ang-an, [respectively], and the sacrifices [to these deities] at Kan-ch'üan [Palace] and at Fen-yin, [respectively], were abolished.

On that day a great wind uprooted large trees that were more than ten spans [in circumference] at the place for sacrifice in Kan-ch'üan [Palace].

The commanderies and kingdoms more than four-tenths [of whose fields] had suffered calamitous visitations were [ordered] not to pay the land tax on cultivated fields.

In the second year, in the spring, the first month, the altars to the Five [Lords on High] at Yung were abolished.

and on [the day] hsin-szu, the Emperor first performed the suburban sacrifice at the place for the suburban sacrifice south of Ch'ang-an.

His imperial edict said, "Recently [We] have moved the altar of the Supreme [One and that of] Sovereign Earth to the place for the suburban sacrifice south [of Chang-an] and the place for the suburban sacrifice north [of Chang-an, respectively]. When we purified Ourself, and in person made the suburban sacrifice to the Lords on High.

August Heaven responded, and [several] supernatural lights appeared simultaneously.

The elders of the three capital commanderies are not [now] put to the trouble of supplying tents and forced service, [hence We merely grant] an amnesty to the criminals who have been sentenced to shave their whiskers, in the prefectures which support the suburban sacrifices, [namely] Ch'ang-an and Ch'ang-ling, together with [such criminals] in the offices at the imperial capital.

[We] reduce the capitation taxes and poll-tax money by forty cash."

In the intercalary [first] month, at the Yen-ling Commune section of Wei-ch'eng [prefecture], the Emperor's tomb was made.

In the second month, an imperial edict [ordered] the three capital [commanderies] and the inner commanderies each to recommend one person who was capable and good, sincere and upright.

In the third month the water of a well in the Northern Palace overflowed and ran out.

On [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the Emperor first sacrificed to Sovereign Earth at the place for the Suburban Sacrifice north [of Ch'ang-an].

On [the day] ping-wu, [the Emperor] established the Empress née Hsü [as Empress].

[The Emperor] abolished the offices of the Six Stables and the Clever Workmen.

In the summer there was a great drought.

[Because] the King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu] Yü, had committed crimes, the prefectures of Fan and K'ang-fu were cut off from [his kingdom].

In the autumn, the Park of Wide Vision was abolished [from the appurtenances of] the Heir-apparent, and it was granted to the members of the imperial house who came to pay their court visits in the spring and autumn. The [imperial] chariots and horses of the stable were reduced.

In the third year, in the spring, the third month, the criminals of the empire were [granted] an amnesty, and two steps in noble rank were granted to the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields. Defaulted land and capitation taxes, and what had been given in aid as loans were not to be collected.

In the autumn, within the [Han-ku] Pass [region] there was a flood.

In the seventh month, a little girl of Szu-shang, Ch'en Ch'ih-kung, who heard that the high water was coming, ran and entered the Kuang city-gate, entered without authorization through the side gate of the Master of the Recipes, and reached [the area of] Wei-yang Palace [under the control of] the Intendant of the [Imperial] Palace Parks, [because] the officials and common people had been frightened and had gone up onto the city wall.

In the ninth month, an imperial edict said, "Recently the commanderies and kingdoms have suffered from a visitation of water, which carried away and killed a large [number of] people, reaching to thousands in number.

In the imperial capital it was causelessly and falsely rumored that a flood was coming, and the officials and common people were terrified, fled, ran, and mounted the city wall.

[This has] perhaps [happened because] vexations, tyrannous, and severely oppressive officials have not yet been suppressed and many of the great multitude have reason for complaint because they have lost their occupations. [We] send the Grandee-remonstrant Lin and others to travel about and inspect the empire."

In the winter, the twelfth month, on [the day] mou-shen, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun and in the night there was an earthquake in the Hall of Wei-yang Palace.

The imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when Heaven gave birth to the multitude of common people, they were unable to rule themselves, [hence Heaven] set up princes for them, in order to rule and control them.

When the way of a [true] prince is attained, then [even] herbs, trees, and insects find their [proper] places. [But] when the prince of men is not virtuous, a reproach appears in Heaven or Earth, and visitations and prodigies happen frequently, in order to inform him that he is not governing rightly.

"Our experience in governing has been [only] for a brief time, so that [We] have not been correct in [Our] acts, hence on [the day] mou-shen there was an eclipse of the sun and an earthquake. We are greatly dismayed.

Let the ministers each think over Our faults and mistakes and state them [to Us] clearly. `You should not assent to [Our] face, and, after you have retired, make other [sorts of] remarks.'

[Let] the Lieutenant Chancellor, [K'uang Heng], and the [Grandee] Secretary, [Yin Chung], with the generals, full marquises, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, together with the inner commanderies and kingdoms, recommend gentlemen who are capable and good, sincere and upright, and able to speak frankly and admonish unflinchingly. [Let] them go to the [Majors in Charge of] the Official Carriages, and We will interview them."

In [the period] Ho-p'ing, the first year, in the spring, the third month, an imperial edict said, "The [Yellow] River broke through its dikes in Tung Commandery and submerged the two provinces [of Yen and Yü]. The Chief Commandant, Wang Yen-shih, diked and stopped the gap and immediately there was calm. Let the year-period be changed to be Ho-p'ing, and let noble ranks be granted to the officials and common people of the empire, to each proportionately."

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] chi-hai, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun, and it was total.

The imperial edict said, "[Ever since] We have secured [the opportunity of] protecting the [imperial] ancestral temples, [We] have trembled with respectful fear, [yet] have not yet been able to be worthy of [Our] title.

A book says, `If the instructions for males are not followed, since matters concerning the yang [or male principle] are not attained, then there will on this account be an eclipse of the sun and Heaven will manifest this [sort of] a prodigy.' The blame [for this eclipse therefore] lies upon Us Ourself.

Let the ministers and grandees exert themselves and do their best to assist [Our] inadequacies, and [let] each of the many officials perfect themselves in their duties. "[Let] rich employment be given to benevolent persons and [let] cruel and injurious persons be dismissed and sent away.

[Let] Our faults and errors be pointed out without keeping silent about anything. [Let] a general amnesty [be granted] to the empire."

In the sixth month, [the office of] Director of Dependent States was abolished and [his duties] were given to the Grand Herald.

In the autumn, the ninth month, the Funerary Chamber, Temple, and Funerary Park of the Grand Emperor were reestablished.

In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] yi-mao, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

[The Emperor] sent the Imperial Household Grandee and Erudit, [Meng] Chia, and others, eleven persons [in all], to inspect and report on the commanderies bordering on the [Yellow] River. [The imperial edict said], "Those whose [property] has been demolished or injured by the floods or who are suffering and indigent and [do not have the means] of keeping themselves alive are [to have their needs] investigated and to be assisted by loans.

For those who have been carried away by the water or have been crushed to death and are unable to be buried by their own [relatives, the legates] shall order the commandery or kingdom to supply small coffins and bury them.

To [the relatives of] each of those who were already buried, there are to be given two thousand cash, and for those who have gone to other commanderies and kingdoms to escape the floods, the places in which they are, are to distribute food to them. [The legates] are to treat them carefully, with courtesy and equity, and are not to cause them to lose their occupations.

[The legates] are to recommend gentlemen who are true and honest, whose conduct is [correct], and who are able to speak frankly."

On [the day] jen-shen, in Ch'ang-ling [prefecture], the high bank on the border of the Ching [River] collapsed, blocking the Ching River.

and in the third month, an amnesty [was granted] to the criminals of the empire.

In the winter, the Governor of the Capital, Wang Chang, who had committed crimes, was sent to prison and died.

In the second year, in the spring, it was cold.

An imperial edict said, "Anciently, when Lord Yao set up the offices for the Hsi and the Ho, he commanded them to prevent the four seasons from losing their order, by taking care of the matters [concerning these seasons].

Hence the Book of History says, `The many people multiplied and the seasons were harmonious', which makes plain that it considers the Yin and Yang as the fundamental [principles of the universe].

Now some of the ministers and grandees do not believe in the Yin and Yang, misprize and disdain them, [with the consequence that] much of what they suggest in their memorials is contrary to the [proper] governmental acts for the seasons.

They propagate [this attitude], so that ignorance [of the rules concerning the seasons] prevails all over the empire. Yet they expect that the Yin and Yang will accord and harmonize. Is not this absurd? Let [the officials] take care to accord with the rules for the four seasons and the months."

In the third month, a general amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

In the summer, the fifth month, the ranks [in the bureaucracy] of eight hundred piculs and five hundred piculs were eliminated.

In the autumn, there was a flood east of [Han-ku] Pass. [An imperial edict ordered that] vagrant people who wished to enter through Han-ku [Pass], T'ien-ching [Pass], Hu Mouth, or Wu-yüan Pass should not be treated harshly or detained. [The Emperor] sent Grandee-remonstrants and Erudits separately to inspect and observe.

In the eighth month, on [the day] chia-shen, the King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu] K'ang, died.

In the ninth month, those who had received [the imperial appointment] as messengers [were found] not to be suitable.

An imperial edict said, "In ancient times, the purpose of establishing an Imperial University was to propagate the principles of the former kings and to spread their transforming influence over the world.

The office of the Forest of Literati is the source and spring for [the culture of all within] the four seas, [hence] it is proper that [its occupants] should all understand clearly ancient and present [times], `reviewing what they already know and acquiring new [knowledge],' and being penetratingly understanding about the constitution of the state. Hence they are called Erudits.

If they are not [thus learned], then those who study with them will not have anything to transmit [to others] and they will be despized by their inferiors, which is not the way to honor morality and virtue.

`A workman who wishes to do his work well must first sharpen his tools.' Let the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Chang Yü], and the [Grandee] Secretary, [Wang Yin], together with [the officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs and at two thousand piculs, recommend from many [sources] those who can fill the post of Erudit in order to bring it about that [the abilities of the Erudits] may be surpassing and they may be looked up to [by all]."

In this year the Grandee Secretary, Chang Chung, died.

In the summer, the sixth month, a convict [workman] in the office for iron in Ying-ch'uan [Commandery], Shen-t'u Sheng, and others, one hundred eighty persons [in all], killed their Chief Official and took the weapons from the arsenal by force. [Shen-t'u Sheng] called himself a general and overran nine prefectures.

[The Emperor] sent a Chief Clerk of the Lieutenant Chancellor and the Palace Assistant Secretary to pursue and arrest them according to [the law] for levying military supplies, and all [the rebels] suffered for their crimes.

In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] ting-szu, the Commander-in-chief and General-in-chief, Wang Feng, died.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "Verily, the `Great Plan' makes food the first of the eight [concerns of] government. This is truly the fundamental [factor in making every] family self-supporting and in doing away with punishments.

[Our] imperial predecessors encouraged agriculturists, lightening their taxes on land and on produce and favoring those who worked diligently [at agriculture]. They ordered that [the Diligent Cultivators of the Fields] should be classed with the Filially Pious and the Fraternally Respectful.

"[But] recently the common people have been more and more indolent and few have inclined towards the fundamental [activity (agriculture), whereas] many have been eager [to give themselves up] to unimportant [matters (merchandizing)]. How can [We] correct them?

"Just now it is the season for the work of spring. Let is be ordered that [the officials ranking at] two thousand piculs shall encourage agriculture and sericulture and shall [send people to] go into the paths between the fields in order to encourage the [farmers].

Does not the Book of History say, `If they labor in the fields, then there will be an [abundant] harvest'? Let [the officials] make strenuous efforts."

In the second month an amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

In the autumn, the ninth month, on [the day] jen-shen, the King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu] Yü, died.

In the intercalary month, on [the day] jen-hsü, the Grandee Secretary, Yü Yung, died.

In [the period] Hung-chia, the first year, in the spring, the second month, an imperial edict said, "We have succeeded [to the care of] Heaven and Earth and have had [the opportunity] to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples, [but Our] insight has in some respects been unclear and [Our] virtue has not been able to bring tranquillity. The punishments have not been appropriate, so that many people have lost their positions through injustice and have [hence] ceaselessly hastened to the [palace] portals to inform and tell [of their wrongs].

Because of this, the Yin and Yang have wandered from their path and are in disorder, so that cold and heat have lost their [proper] succession, the sun and moon have had no brilliance, and people have exposed themselves to criminal punishment. We pity them greatly.

Does not the Book of History say, `Among my [officials] who are managing affairs, none is capable or aged. The blame lies upon them themselves'?

"Just now it is spring, the season for birth and growth. [We] have visited the Grandee-remonstrant Li and others and send them to report unjust law-cases in the three capital [commanderies], the three Ho [commanderies], and Hung-nung [Commandery].

The ministers, grandees, and Inspectors of Divisions shall inform clearly and warn the Administrators and Chancellors [of commanderies and kingdoms, respectively,] to conform to Our intentions.

Let there be granted to the common people of the empire one step in noble rank; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; and [let there be] added grants of silk to widowers, widows, orphans, childless, and the aged. Defaulted loans [from the government] and what has not yet been paid shall not be collected."

On [the day] jen-wu, [the Emperor] traveled and favored his imperial tomb [with a visit, where he granted] an amnesty to the convicts working [on the tomb]. Ch'ang-ling Prefecture was made out of the Hsi District of Hsin-feng [Prefecture]. Those who were to support [the sacrifices at] the imperial tomb were granted an ox and wine for [every] hundred households.

The Emperor for the first time went out to travel incognito.

In the winter, a yellow dragon appeared in [the kingdom of] Chen-ting.

In the second year, in the spring, [the Emperor] traveled and favored [with a visit] Yün-yang [Prefecture, in which was Kan-ch'üan Palace].

In the third month, when the Erudits were performing the rites for drinking wine, pheasants flew and perched in the courtyard, came up the steps, mounted to the hall, and crowed. Later they perched in various yamens, and also perched in the Ch'eng-ming Hall.

The imperial edict said, "Anciently, when [a ruler] selected capable [officials], he made them express themselves, accepted them `in accordance with their discussions, and tested them clearly by their achievements.'

Hence in the government offices affairs were not neglected and among his subordinates there were no negligent people. [Consequently, the ruler's] instruction and civilizing influence spread abroad and was carried out, the winds and rain were harmonious and timely, the various grains therefore ripened, the multitude of commoners rejoiced in their occupations, and all were as a result prosperous and tranquil.

"We have succeeded to [this] great estate for more than ten years, yet have several times met with visitations of flood, drought, sicknesses, and epidemics, so that the many common people have frequently suffered from hunger and cold, [and, as a result, although We] hoped that the rules of proper conduct and moral principles would flourish, how could it not but have been difficult [to achieve anything]?

Since We have not had any means of leading and guiding [the people], the way of [the sage] lords and [true] kings has been daily falling into decadence. Is it that the road for inviting and selecting capable gentlemen has been blocked and is not open, or is it that those who recommend [persons for official examination] have not yet found the [right] persons?

Let there be recommended persons who are true and honest, whose conduct [is according to] moral principles, and who are able to speak frankly, [so that We may] hope to hear earnest speech and excellent deliberation in order to correct Our inadequacies."

In the summer, braves and stalwarts from the commanderies and kingdoms whose property was five million [cash] or more, [to the number of] five thousand households, were moved to Ch'ang-ling [Prefecture]. There were granted to the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Hsieh Hsüan], the [Grandee] Secretary, [Wang Chün], the generals, the full marquises, the princesses, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, places for tombs and residences [at Ch'ang-ling].

In the sixth month, [the Emperor] set up [Liu] Yün-k'o, a grandson [of a younger brother] of King Hsien of Chung-shan, [Liu Fu], as King of Kuang-tê.

In the third year, in the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty [was granted] to the empire and it was ordered that officials and common people were to be allowed to purchase noble ranks at the price of a thousand cash per step.

There was a great drought.

In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] yi-mao, there was a visitation [of fire] to the [Northern] Portal of the Temple to [Emperor] Hsiao-ching.

and in the winter, the eleventh month, on [the day] chia-yin, the Empress née Hsü was dismissed.

Cheng Kung, a man of Kuang-han [Commandery], and others, more than sixty persons in all, attacked the government offices and buildings, taking by force the prisoners and convicts and robbing arms from the arsenal. He called himself the Lord of the Mountains.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "[We] have several times issued a decree to the high officials that they should take care to be liberal and large-minded in their actions and should prohibit tyranny and oppression, [but] down to the present [their behavior] has not changed.

If one person commits a crime, they recommend that his clan should be arrested and imprisoned. The farmers and common people who have lost their occupations and who cherish grudges and hatred [against the government] are many, which injures and damages the harmonious emanation, so that water and drought have produced visitations. East of [Han-ku] Pass, vagrants and roving [people] are many, and in the Ch'ing, Yu, and Chi [Provincial] sections [the situation] is especially serious, so that We are greatly pained.

[We] have not heard that any one in [high] positions is saddened. Who, [then], is capable of assisting Us by being solicitous in this [situation]?

"[We] have already sent messengers to travel about and inspect the commanderies and kingdoms. In [those commanderies and kingdoms] that have been injured by the visitations and disasters [to the extent of] four-tenths [of their normal produce] or more, the common people whose property is not as much as thirty thousand [cash] shall not [be required] to pay the land-tax or capitation taxes.

Defaulted loans and what has not yet been paid shall all not be collected. Those wandering people who wish to enter through the passes shall be enregistered and admitted whenever [they arrive]. Those who [wish to] go to [other] commanderies or kingdoms shall be treated respectfully and with equity. [Let the officials] take care that they have the desire to preserve and keep alive [the refugees], in order that they may accord with Our intentions."

In the autumn, in P'o-hai and Ch'ing-ho [Commanderies, the Yellow] River overflowed. Those who suffered from the visitation were assisted by loans.

In the winter, in Kuang-han [Commandery], Cheng Kung and others [formed] a faction which gradually spread, invading and passing through four prefectures. His horde [numbered] almost ten thousand persons.

[The Emperor] installed the Chief Commandant of Ho-tung [Commandery], Chao Hu, as the Grand Administrator of Kuang-han [Commandery] and mobilized [the people] in that commandery together with [those in] Shu Commandery, altogether thirty thousand men, to attack [the rebels].

Some [of the rebels] seized and beheaded other [rebels], in order to expunge [their own] crimes, and in ten months [the region] was pacified. [The Emperor later] promoted [Chao] Hu to be Chief of Palace Police in the Capital and granted him a hundred catties of actual gold.

In [the period] Yung-shih, the first year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] kuei-ch'ou, there was a fire in the Ice Chamber of the Grand Provisioner, on [the day] mou-wu there was a fire in [the Southern] Portal of the Funerary Park of Queen Li.

and in the summer, the fourth month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed [Chao] Lin, the father of the Favorite Beauty née Chao, [Chao Fei-yen], as Marquis of Ch'eng-yang.

In the fifth month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed, as Marquis of Hsin-tu, the Palace Attendant, Chief Commandant of Cavalry, and Imperial Household Grandee, Wang Mang, who was the son of [the Emperor's] maternal uncle, [Wang] Wan.

In the sixth month, on [the day] ping-yin, [the Emperor] established the Empress née Chao, [Chao Fei-yen, as Empress], and [granted] a general amnesty to the empire.

In the autumn, the seventh month, an imperial edict said, "Our grasp of virtue has not been firm and in [Our] plans [We] have not [consulted] all of [Our] subordinates, [so that We] have erred in listening to the Court Architect, [Chieh] Wan-nien, who said that the Ch'ang Tomb could be completed in the third year.

He has worked [at it] to the fifth year, [but] has not yet set anyone to work inside the Majors' Gates to its Hall in the central part of the Tomb.

The empire's [treasury] is empty and exhausted and the people are worn out and fatigued. The earth taken from other places [distant from the Tomb] is scanty and bad, so that in the end [the Tomb] cannot be completed.

When We reflect upon these difficulties, [We] are saddened and afflicted at heart. Verily `to err and not to reform may indeed be called error.

Let the Ch'ang Tomb [and the town of Ch'ang-ling] be abolished and [let the imperial tomb] be returned to the former Tomb. Let no officials or common people be moved [to the former Tomb], so that in the empire there may not be caused any disturbance in peoples' hearts."

[The Emperor] set up [Liu] Li, a son of King Hsiao of Ch'eng-yang, [Liu Ching], as King [of Ch'eng-yang].

In the eighth month, on [the day] ting-ch'ou, the [Ch'iung-ch'eng] Grand Empress Dowager née Wang died.

In the second year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] chi-ch'ou, the Commander-in-chief and General of Chariots and Cavalry, Wang Yin, died.

In the second month, on [the day] kuei-wei, at night, stars fell like rain. On [the day] i-yu, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "Recently a dragon appeared in Tung-lai and there was an eclipse of the sun. Heaven has displayed a prodigy to make clear Our anxiety, and We are greatly afraid.

Let the high ministers instruct the many officials to think deeply about Heaven's warning, and if there are any measures which can be abolished or reduced to bring peace and ease to the people, let them present memorials listing them. The loans which have been made to poor people are not to be collected."

It also said, "For several years the eastern regions beyond the [Han-ku] Pass have had no good harvests. When officials and common people have righteously received and fed poor people or have contributed grain to assist the government in relieving distress, they have already been given compensation. Those who contributed a million [cash] or more are to be additionally granted the noble rank of Right Alternate. If they wish to be officials, they shall be appointed to posts of three hundred piculs; if they are already officials, they shall be promoted two grades.

Those who contributed three hundred thousand [cash] or more are to be granted the noble rank of Five Excellencies; if they are officials, they shall also be promoted two grades; if they are common people, they shall be appointed to be Gentlemen.

Those who contributed a hundred thousand [cash] or more shall have their families exempted from land tax and poll tax for three years; those who contributed ten thousand [cash] or more shall be exempted for one year."

In the winter, the eleventh month, [the Emperor] traveled to Yung and sacrificed at the Five Altars.

In the twelfth month, an imperial edict said, "Previously, the Court Architect Wan-nien knew that the Chang Tomb was low-lying and unfit to be a permanent residence for the emperor, yet he memorialized requesting its construction, establishing outer city walls and settlements, making reckless and excessive designs, piling up earth to raise the foundation, imposing heavy taxes and forced labor, and initiating hasty construction projects.

The convicts and laborers have suffered injustice, the dead have been numerous, the people are utterly exhausted, and the empire is impoverished.

The Regular Attendant Hung, when he was previously the Assistant Minister of Agriculture, several times memorialized that the Chang Tomb could not be completed.

The Palace Attendant and Commandant of the Imperial Guard Chang several times stated that it was proper to stop the project early and move the families back to their original places.

We, upon Chang's words, issued Hung's memorial, and all the high ministers who discussed it agreed with Chang's plan.

Chang was the first to propose this excellent plan, and Hung was in charge of reducing great expenses, so that the people could live in peace and prosperity.

Hung was previously granted the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis and a hundred catties of gold. Now, Chang is granted the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis with a fief of a thousand households, and Hung with five hundred households.

Wan-nien, being a flatterer, wicked and disloyal, his poison has spread among the common people, and resentment throughout the empire has not ceased to this day. Although he has received a pardon, it is not proper for him to reside in the imperial capital. He is to be exiled to Tun-huang Commandery."

In this year, the Grandee Secretary, Wang Chün, died.

In the third year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] yi-mao, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "Heavenly disasters have been repeated and severe, and We are greatly alarmed. Considering that the people have lost their occupations, We personally dispatch the Grand Chamberlain Chia and others to travel throughout the empire, to visit and inquire after the elderly, and to learn of the people's hardships. They, together with the Regional Inspectors, are to recommend one person each who is honest, simple, modest, yielding, and virtuous."

In the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] keng-ch'en, the Empress Dowager issued an edict ordering the relevant officials to restore the sacrifices at the Tai-chi Altar in Kan-ch'üan, the Hou-t'u Altar in Fen-yin, the Five Altars in Yung, and the Chen-pao Shrine in Chen-c'ang. The details are in the "Treatise on Sacrifices".

In the eleventh month, Fan Ping, a man from Wei-shih, and thirteen others plotted rebellion, killed the Grand Administrator of Ch'en-liu, plundered officials and common people, and called themselves generals.

The convicts Li T'an and four others together attacked and killed Fan Ping and the others, and all were enfeoffed as full marquises.

In the twelfth month, Su Ling and two hundred twenty-eight other convicts from the iron office in Shan-yang Commandery attacked and killed their superiors, stole weapons from the arsenal, called themselves generals, passed through nineteen commanderies and kingdoms, and killed the Grand Administrator of Tung Commandery and the Chief Commandant of Ju-nan.

The Chief Clerk of the Prime Minister and the Palace Assistant Secretary were dispatched with credentials to supervise and urge the pursuit and arrest. The Grand Administrator of Ju-nan, Yen Hsin, captured and beheaded Su Ling and the others. Hsin was appointed Grand Minister of Agriculture and awarded a hundred catties of gold.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, the Emperor traveled to Kan-ch'üan, performed the suburban sacrifice at the Tai-chi Altar, and divine light descended and gathered in the Purple Hall. A general amnesty was granted to the empire. The officials and common people of Yün-yang were awarded noble ranks; for every hundred households of women, oxen and wine were given; and widowers, widows, orphans, childless persons, and the elderly were given silk.

In the third month, the Emperor traveled to Ho-tung, sacrificed to the Earth Deity, and bestowed gifts on officials and common people as in Yün-yang. The places through which he passed were exempted from land tax.

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] kuei-wei, both the Lin-hua Hall of the Ch'ang-lo Palace and the Eastern司马门 of the Wei-yang Palace were struck by fire.

In the sixth month, on [the day] chia-wu, the gate of the Pa Tomb park was struck by fire. The concubines at Tu Tomb who had never served the emperor were sent home.

An imperial edict said, "Recently, there has been an earthquake in the capital and repeated fires, and We are greatly alarmed. Let the relevant officials carefully and clearly explain the blame for these disasters; We will personally examine their responses."

It also said, "Sage kings clarified ritual and propriety to order the noble and the base, and distinguished carriages and clothing to manifest virtue. Even if one has wealth, without the corresponding honor, one must not exceed the regulations. Thus, the people strive to act virtuously, valuing righteousness over profit.

Nowadays, the common customs of extravagance and usurpation are limitless and insatiable. The high ministers, marquises, relatives, and close attendants, who are models for the four corners of the empire, have not been heard of cultivating themselves, abiding by ritual, or united in their concern for the state.

Some even indulge in luxury and ease, striving to expand their mansions, build gardens and ponds, keep many slaves and concubines, wear fine silks and gauzes, set up bells and drums, maintain female musicians, and exceed regulations in carriages, clothing, weddings, and funerals.

Officials and common people imitate them, and this has gradually become a custom. Yet to hope that the people will be frugal and that every family will have enough is indeed difficult!

Does not the Book of Odes say, `Majestic is the Grand Master Yin; the people all look up to you'? Let the relevant officials be instructed to gradually prohibit these practices.

Blue and green, which are the usual clothing colors of the people, are not to be prohibited for the time being. Marquises and close attendants should each examine themselves and reform. The Colonel Director of Retainers is to investigate those who do not change."

In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-wei, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In [the period] Yüan-yen, the first year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] chi-hai, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the third month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Yung [with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the first day], ting-yu, when there were no clouds, there was a sound of thunder and light shone out on all sides, descending to the earth. At dusk it stopped. An amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

In the autumn, the seventh month, a comet appeared in [the constellation] Tung-ching.

The imperial edict said, "Recently there have been eclipses and falling stars, reproaches appearing in heaven. Great prodigies have been repeated, [but] those who are in [official] positions have been silent; rarely have there been loyal utterances.

Now a comet has appeared in [the constellation] Tung-ching. We are greatly dismayed. Let the ministers, grandees, erudits, and grandee-consultants each do their best in pondering and thinking upon the meaning of these grievous vicissitudes, and parallel them clearly from the Classics [in explanation], not keeping silent about anything.

Let them and the inner commanderies and kingdoms each recommend one sincere and upright person who is able to speak frankly and admonish unflinchingly, and let the twenty-two commanderies at the northern border each recommend one person who is brave and fierce and knows the methods of warfare."

[The Emperor] enfeoffed [Hsiao] Hsi, a descendant of the Chancellor of State, Hsiao [Ho], as Marquis of Tsan.

In the winter, the twelfth month, on [the day] hsin-hai, the Commander-in-chief and General-in-chief, Wang Shang, died.

In the second month, on [the day] kuei-ch'ou, an imperial edict said, "We have succeeded to the vast estate of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and have upheld the [imperial] ancestral temples to the twenty-fifth year. [But Our] virtue has been unable to give tranquility to or administer [properly the region] within the [empire's] boundaries. Many are the people who [cherish] resentment.

[We] have not received the blessing of Heaven, [for] down to the present [We] have not yet had an heir to succeed [Us], and the empire has no one to whom its hearts can attach themselves.

When [We] look over the warnings [in the history] of the distant past and of recent events, the beginnings of calamities and disorders have all come from this [lack of an appointed heir].

The King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu] Hsin, has [acted] toward Us as a son. He is affectionate, benevolent, filial, and obedient, so that he may therefore follow [Us] in the succession [decreed by] Heaven, and continue the [imperial] sacrifices. Let [Liu] Hsin be made the Imperial Heir-apparent.

Let the Grandee-remonstrant Feng Ts'an, who is the maternal uncle of the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], be enfeoffed as Marquis of Yi-hsiang, and let the kingdom of Chung-shan be increased by thirty thousand households, in order to console [Liu Hsing's] feelings, [since he is not made Heir-apparent].

Let there be granted: to the vassal kings and full marquises, gold; to those in the empire who will be the successors to their fathers, a noble rank; to the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, silk, to each proportionately."

It also said, "Verily, [We] have heard that the [true] kings necessarily preserved the descendants of the two [preceding] kingly [dynasties], in order that they might thereby connect themselves with the Three Beginnings.

Anciently, T'ang the Victorious received [Heaven's] mandate and [his dynasty, the Yin,] is grouped among the Three Dynasties, yet his sacrifices have been neglected and cut off.

When [We] sought for his descendants, none was more upright than K'ung Chi. Let [K'ung] Chi be enfeoffed as the Marquis Continuing and Honoring the Yin [Dynasty]."

In the third month, his noble rank was advanced to be that of Duke. Together with the Marquis who Succeeds to the Greatness of the Chou [Dynasty, Chi Tang], they were both made Dukes, each with a territory of a hundred li [square].

In the fourth month, on [the day] yi-mao, [the Emperor] was buried in the Yen Tomb.

In eulogy we say: Your servant [Pan Piao's] paternal aunt was given a place in the [imperial] harem and became a Favorite Beauty; her father, [Pan K'uang], his sons and her brothers waited [upon the Emperor] in his private apartments, and frequently said to your servant,

"Emperor Ch'eng was good at cultivating his deportment and appearance. `When he mounted his chariot, he stood upright, he did not look around, he did not speak hastily, he did not point with his hands.' When he attended court, he was profound and silent, dignified and grave like a god, so that it might be [truly] said, Majestic is the bearing of the Son of Heaven.

He read widely on [both] ancient and present [matters], and received frank discourses indulgently." His ministers were worthy of their positions, and their memorials and discussions are worthy of being transmitted [to posterity].

He happened upon an age which inherited a peaceful condition, when the superior and his inferiors were in concord. Yet he gave himself up to wine and women. The Chao clan caused disorder within [the palace] and his maternal relatives made themselves masters in the court. In saying this, I cannot but feel oppressed.

From [the period] Chien-shih onwards, the Wang clan first grasped the power of the state. [Emperors] Ai and P'ing had [only] short lives, and [Wang] Mang thereupon usurped the throne. In fact his [usurpation of the imperial power, thereby enabling him to grant] severity or favor, came about [very] gradually.</div>
