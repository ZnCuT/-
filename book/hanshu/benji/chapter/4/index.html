          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-hui was the Heir-apparent of [Emperor] Kao-tsu. His mother was called the Empress [née] Lü.

When Emperor [Hsiao-hui] was in his fifth year, Kao-tsu first became King of Hans.

In [Kao-tsu's] second year [the future Emperor Hsiao-hui] was established as Heir-apparent.

In the twelfth year, the fourth month, Kao-tsu died.

In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-yin, the Heir-apparent took the imperial throne. He honored the Empress, entitling her, the Empress Dowager.

He granted to the common people one step in noble rank.

The Gentlemen-of-the-Household and the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace [who had served] six full years [were granted] three steps in noble rank; [those who had served] four years [were granted] two steps.

The Gentlemen-outside-the-Household [who had served] six full years [were granted] two steps.

Gentlemen-of-the-Household who had not [served] a full year [were granted] one step.

Gentlemen-outside-the-Household who had not [served] two full years were granted ten thousand cash.

Eunuchs and Masters of the Food [were treated] the same as Gentlemen-of-the-Palace. Palace Internuncios, Guards, Spear-bearers, Men of War, and Grooms [were treated] the same as Gentlemen-outside-the-Household.

The Heir-apparent's [Chariot-]driver and his Chariot-companion were granted the aristocratic rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee; the members of his suite [who had served] five full years were given two steps.

There were granted to those who had provided for the [imperial] burial ceremonies and [had positions ranking as] two thousand piculs, twenty thousand cash; [to those who had positions ranking as] six hundred piculs and over, ten thousand [cash]; to [those who had positions ranking as] five hundred piculs, two hundred piculs, and under, [down] to the Accessory Officials, five thousand [cash].

[The Emperor] reduced the tax on arable ground and revived it [at the rate of] one part in fifteen.

Those who had the aristocratic rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee, and officials [ranking as] six hundred piculs and above, together with those who had served the [young] emperor so that he knew their names, if they had committed crimes, and should justly be shackled like robbers, they were all to be put in honorable detention.

Those of [the aristocratic rank of] Superior Accomplished and above, together with the great-grandsons of marquises or kings belonging to the imperial house by male or female descent who had committed crimes and should justly [suffer] mutilating punishment, together with those who should justly be made to [build] the fortifications or [patrol from] the break of day or pound [rice], were all to have their whiskers shaved and be made to [cut] firewood for the spirits or [prepare] pure rice.

Common people who are in their seventieth year or over or not fully ten years old, who had committed crimes and should justly [suffer] mutilating punishment, were not to be mutilated.

[The edict] also said, "Officials [exist] for the sake of governing the people. If [the officials] are able to fulfil their [duties in] government, then the people [can] rely upon them. Hence [We] make their salaries large, the reason for doing which is [for the sake of] the people.

Now the fathers and mothers, the wives and children, and the other members of the families of officials who have [the rank] of six hundred piculs or above, together with the former officials who have in the past worn the seal of a General or of a Chief Commandant and have led troops, or have worn the seal of an official [with the rank of] two thousand piculs—their families shall pay only the military tax and shall not be required to pay any other [taxes]."

[The Emperor] ordered the commanderies and the vassal kings to establish temples to Kao-tsu.

In the first year, in the winter, the twelfth month, King Yin of Chao, [Liu] Ju-yi, died.

[The Emperor ordered that] when the common people commit crime, they are to be allowed to purchase thirty steps in noble rank in order to avoid capital punishment.

In the sixth month, from the [states of] the vassal kings and marquises, 20,000 criminals and retainers were sent to build the city wall of Ch'ang-an.

The King of Nan-yüeh, Chao T'o, pronounced himself a subject [of the Emperor] and presented tribute.

In the fourth year, in the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] jen-yin, [the Emperor] established the Empress nee Chang [as Empress].

In the spring, the first month, common people who were filially pious, fraternally respectful and [diligent] cultivators of the fields were recommended and their persons exempted [from taxes and forced service].

In the third month, on [the day] chia-tzu, the Emperor was capped and [an amnesty was granted] to the world.

In reducing the laws and orders which annoyed the officials and people, there was abrogated the criminal law against possessing books.

There was a visitation [of fire] in the Wild Goose Terrace in the Ch'ang-lo Palace.

[The Emperor] granted aristocratic ranks to the people, to each household one step.

In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the King of Ch'i, [Liu] Fei, died.

It was ordered that the people were to be allowed to sell noble ranks.

Girls who were in their fifteenth year and over, up to their thirtieth [year] and who were not married were [ordered to pay as a tax] five [times the] poll-tax.

In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] mou-yin, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Palace.

In the ninth month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, he was buried at the An Tomb.

In eulogy we say: [Emperor] Hsiao-hui, in his family, cultivated the love of his relatives; in the state, he honored his Ruling Chancellors. He loved [King] Tao-[hui] of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], and [King] Yin of Chao, [Liu Ju-yi], most dearly. His kindness and his sense of respect were both deep indeed.

When he heard the admonition of Shu-sun T'ung, he was greatly dismayed. When he accepted the response of the Chancellor of State Ts'ao [Ts'an], he was glad at heart. He may be called a [most] generous and kindly ruler.

He happened [upon a time when the state was ruled by] the Empress Dowager [née] Lü, who damaged and injured his perfect virtue. It was sad indeed.</div>
