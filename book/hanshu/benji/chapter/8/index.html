          <div class="txt">孝景皇帝，文帝太子也。母曰窦皇后。

后七年六月，文帝崩。丁未，太子即皇帝位，尊皇太后薄氏曰太皇太后，皇后曰皇太后。

九月，有星孛于西方。

元年冬十月，诏曰：“盖闻古者祖有功而宗有德，制礼乐各有由。

歌者，所以发德也；舞者，所以明功也。

高庙酎，奏《武德》、《文始》《五行》之舞。

孝惠庙酎，奏《文始》、《五行》之舞。

孝文皇帝临天下，通关梁，不异远方；除诽谤，去肉刑，赏赐长老，收恤孤独，以遂群生；减耆欲，不受献，罪人不帑，不诛亡罪，不私其利也；除宫刑，出美人，重绝人之世也。

朕既不敏，弗能胜识。

此皆上世之所不及，而孝文皇帝亲行之。

德厚侔天地，利泽施四海，靡不获福。

明象乎日月，而庙乐不称，朕甚惧焉。

其为孝文皇帝庙为《昭德》这舞，以明休德。

然后祖宗之功德，施于万世，永永无穷，朕甚嘉之。

其与丞相、列侯、中二千石、礼官具礼仪奏。”

丞相臣嘉等奏曰：“陛下永思孝道，立《昭德》之舞以明孝文皇帝之盛德，皆臣嘉等愚所不及。

臣谨议：世功莫大于高皇帝，德莫盛于孝文皇帝。

高皇帝庙宜为帝者太祖之庙，孝文皇帝庙宜为帝者太宗之庙。

天子宜世世献祖宗之庙。

郡国诸侯宜各为孝文皇帝立太宗之庙。

诸侯王、列侯使者侍祠天子所献祖宗之庙。

请宣布天下。”

制曰“可”。

春正月，诏曰：“间者岁比不登，民多乏食，夭绝天年，朕甚痛之。

其议民欲徙宽大地者，听之。”

廷尉信谨与丞相议曰：“吏及诸有秩受其官属所监、所治、所行、所将，其与饮食，计偿费，勿论。

它物，若买故贱，卖故贵，皆坐臧为盗，没入臧县官。

吏迁徙免罢，受其故官属所将监治送财物，夺爵为士伍，免之。

吏六百石以上，皆长吏也。亡度者、或不吏服出入闾里，与民亡异。

令长吏二千石车朱两轓；千石至六百石朱左轓。

车骑从者不称其官衣服、下吏出入闾巷亡吏体者，二千石上其官属，三辅举不如法令者，皆上丞相御史请之。”

先是，吏多军功，车、服尚轻，故为设禁，又惟酷吏奉宪失中，乃诏有司减笞法，定棰令。语在《刑法志》。

农事伤则饥之本也，女红害则寒之原也。

夫饥寒并至，而能亡为非者寡矣。

朕亲耕，后亲桑，以奉宗庙粢盛、祭服，为天下先；不受献，减太官，省徭赋，欲天下务农蚕，素有畜积，以备灾害。

强毋攘弱，众毋暴寡；老耆以寿终，幼孤得遂长。

今，岁或不登，民食颇寡，其咎安在？

或诈伪为吏，吏以货赂为市，渔夺百姓，侵牟万民。

县丞，长吏也，奸法与盗盗，甚无谓也。

其令二千石各修其职；不事官职、耗乱者，丞相以闻，请其罪。

布告天下，使明知朕意。”

五月，诏曰：“人不患其不知，患其为诈也；不患其不勇，患其为暴也；不患其不富，患其亡厌也。

其唯廉士，寡欲易足。

今訾算十以上乃得官，廉士算不必众。

有市籍不得官，无訾又不得官，朕甚愍之。

訾算四得官，亡令廉士久失职，贪夫长利。”

秋，大旱。

三年春正月，诏曰：“农，天下之本也。黄金、珠玉，饥不可食，寒不可衣，以为币用，不识其终始。

间岁或不登，意为末者众，农民寡也。

周云成、康，汉言文、景，美矣！</div>

          <div class="txt">汉景帝，是汉文帝的太子。母亲是窦皇后。

后元七年六月，文帝去世。丁未日，太子登上皇帝位，尊皇太后薄氏为太皇太后，皇后为皇太后。

九月，有彗星出现在西方。

景帝元年冬十月，下诏说：“听说古代把有大功的人称为祖，把有大德的人称为宗，制作礼乐各有其缘由。

歌唱，是用来抒发德行的；舞蹈，是用来彰显功绩的。

在高祖庙举行酎祭时，演奏《武德》《文始》《五行》舞。

在孝惠帝庙举行酎祭时，演奏《文始》《五行》舞。

孝文皇帝统治天下时，开放关隘桥梁，对远方地区一视同仁；废除诽谤罪，去掉肉刑，赏赐老年人，收养抚恤孤儿寡母，来使众生顺遂；节制嗜好欲望，不接受进献，对罪犯不株连其妻子儿女，不诛杀无罪的人，不使个人利益偏私；废除宫刑，放出宫女，重视不使人们断绝后代。

朕既然不聪明，不能完全知晓这些。

这些都是前代所不能及的，而孝文皇帝亲自实行了。

他的德行深厚如同天地，恩泽施加到四海，没有谁不获得福祉。

他的光明像日月一样，可是祭祀宗庙的乐舞与之不相称，朕对此很惶恐。

应该为孝文皇帝庙创作《昭德》舞，来彰显他的美德。

这样以后祖宗的功德，就能流传到万世，永远无穷无尽，朕非常赞赏这件事。

可与丞相、列侯、中二千石官员、礼官一起备办礼仪上奏。”

丞相臣申屠嘉等上奏说：“陛下长久思考孝道，创立《昭德》舞来彰显孝文皇帝的盛大德行，这都是臣申屠嘉等人愚昧所不能及的。

臣等谨慎商议：世间的功绩没有比高皇帝更大的，德行没有比孝文皇帝更盛的。

高皇帝庙应该作为帝王的太祖庙，孝文皇帝庙应该作为帝王的太宗庙。

天子应该世世代代祭祀祖宗之庙。

郡国诸侯应该各自为孝文皇帝建立太宗庙。

诸侯王、列侯的使者侍奉祭祀天子所祭祀的祖宗之庙。

请求向天下宣布。”

皇上下令说“可以”。

春季正月，下诏说：“近来连续几年收成不好，百姓大多缺少粮食，过早地死去，没能终其天年，朕对此很痛心。

有的郡国土地瘠薄狭小，没有地方进行农耕桑蚕和畜牧；有的地方土地肥沃广阔，牧草茂盛，水源便利，却不能迁移过去。

可商议让百姓中想要迁移到宽广肥沃土地的人，听凭他们前往。”

夏季四月，大赦天下。赏赐百姓爵位一级。

派遣御史大夫青翟到代国边境与匈奴和亲。

五月，下令农田征收一半的租税。

秋季七月，下诏说：“官吏接受所监管对象的饮食而被免职，处罚过重；接受财物，贱买贵卖，处罚过轻。廷尉与丞相重新商议制定法令。”

廷尉信谨慎地与丞相商议后说：“官吏及各级有俸禄的人接受其下属所监管、治理、差使、统领的对象的东西，若是饮食，计算价值偿还费用，不予论处。

其他物品，若是故意低价买入，故意高价卖出，都按贪赃盗窃罪论处，赃物没收入官府。

官吏调动、免职、罢官，接受原来的下属所统领、监管、治理的对象赠送的财物，削夺爵位成为士兵，免除官职。

没有爵位的，罚金二斤，并下令没收所接受的财物。

有能捕捉告发的人，给予其所没收的赃物。”

将恢说及其妻子儿女依法论处。”

夏季六月，下诏说：“从前吴王刘濞等人叛逆，起兵威胁，连累欺骗官吏百姓，官吏百姓是不得已的。如今刘濞等人已经被消灭，官吏百姓中应当因刘濞等人而连坐以及逃跑脱军的人，都予以赦免。

楚元王的儿子刘艺等人和刘濞等人一起叛逆，朕不忍心对他们施加刑法，除去他们在宗室的名册，不让他们玷污宗室。”立平陆侯刘礼为楚王，延续元王的后代。

列侯去世以及诸侯太傅刚被任命官职，大行上奏谥号、诔文、策书。

诸侯王去世，派遣光禄大夫吊唁、赠送丧葬衣物、祭祀、赠送助丧财物，处理丧事，趁机确立继位的儿子。

列侯去世，派遣太中大夫吊唁祭祀，处理丧事，趁机确立继位者。

他们安葬时，封国可以征发百姓牵引灵车、挖掘墓穴、回填泥土，修治坟墓所用人力不超过三百人，完成事情。

刑狱，是人的重大生命关涉，死了的人不能再活过来。

九月，下诏说：“法令度量，是用来禁止暴虐、制止邪恶的。

有的官吏不奉行法令，把财物贿赂当作交易，结党营私，把苛刻当作明察，把刻薄当作精明，使无罪的人失去本分，朕非常怜悯他们。

有罪的人不认罪，触犯法律施行暴力，这是很没有道理的。

各种疑难案件，若是虽然在法律条文上能定罪但在人心上不能令人满意的，就进行复审。”

六年冬十月，皇帝前往雍地，在五畤举行郊祀。

十二月，更改各官职名称。制定铸造假钱、伪造黄金者处弃市之刑的法律。

春季三月，下雪。

夏季四月，梁王去世。将梁国分为五个封国，立梁孝王的五个儿子都为王。

五月，下诏说：“官吏，是百姓的老师。车马、衣服应当与身份相称。

六百石以上的官吏，都是高级官吏。没有节度的人，有的不穿官服出入乡里，和百姓没有区别。

命令二千石的高级官吏的车两边的车帷涂成红色；千石到六百石的官吏左边的车帷涂成红色。

车马随从的服饰与官职不相称、下级官吏出入街巷没有官吏体统的，二千石的官吏上报其下属，三辅地区检举不符合法令的人，都上报丞相御史请求处置。”

在此之前，官吏多有军功，车马、服饰崇尚轻便，所以制定禁令，又考虑到酷吏执行法令失当，于是下诏有关部门减轻笞刑的处罚，制定棰刑的法令。这些内容记载在《刑法志》中。

六月，匈奴侵入雁门，到达武泉，进入上郡，掠取苑中的马匹。官吏士兵战死的有二千人。

秋七月辛亥日是月末，发生日食。

后元年春正月，下诏说：“刑狱，是重要的事情。人有聪明愚蠢，官员有上下等级。

有疑问的案件由有关部门审议，有关部门不能决断的，移交廷尉。

有命令审议而后处理不当的，审议的人不算过失。想要让治理刑狱的人务必首先从宽处理。”

春季，匈奴侵入雁门，太守冯敬与之交战战死。派遣车骑材官驻守。

春季，因为年成不好，禁止内地各郡用粮食喂马，违者没收马匹。

夏四月，下诏说：“雕刻花纹，损伤农业生产；精美刺绣、彩色丝带，危害女工。

农业生产受损是饥饿的根源，女工受危害是寒冷的根源。

饥饿寒冷同时到来，而能不做坏事的人很少。

朕亲自耕种，皇后亲自采桑养蚕，来供奉宗庙的祭品、祭服，为天下人做表率；不接受进献，减少太官的费用，节省徭役赋税，想要天下人致力于农业养蚕，平时有积蓄，来防备灾害。

强者不要掠夺弱者，人多的不要欺凌人少的；老年人能寿终正寝，幼儿孤儿能顺利成长。

如今，年成有时不好，百姓粮食很匮乏，过错在哪里呢？

有的欺诈虚伪的人做了官吏，官吏把财物贿赂当作交易，掠夺百姓，侵害万民。

县丞，是高级官吏，触犯法律与盗贼同流合污，这是很没有道理的。

命令二千石的官员各自整治自己的职责；不从事官职、昏乱的人，丞相上报，请求治罪。

向天下公布，使百姓清楚地知道朕的意思。”

五月，下诏说：“人不担心他没有知识，担心他弄虚作假；不担心他不勇敢，担心他施行暴力；不担心他不富裕，担心他贪得无厌。

只有廉洁的人，欲望少容易满足。

如今资产达到十万钱以上才能做官，廉洁的人资产不一定多。

有商人户籍的不能做官，没有资产的又不能做官，朕很怜悯他们。

资产达到四万钱可以做官，不要让廉洁的人长久失去职位，让贪婪的人长久获利。”

秋季，大旱。

三年春正月，下诏说：“农业，是天下的根本。黄金、珠玉，饥饿时不能吃，寒冷时不能穿，把它们当作货币使用，不知道它们的始末。

近年来有时年成不好，我想是从事工商业的人多，农民少的缘故。

命令郡国务必鼓励农业养蚕，多种树，可以得到衣服食物。

官吏征发百姓或者雇佣民工开采黄金、珠玉的，按贪赃盗窃罪论处。二千石的官员听之任之的，与他们同罪。”

皇太子举行加冠礼，赏赐百姓中作为父亲继承人的人爵位一级。

甲子日，皇帝在未央宫去世。

遗诏赏赐诸侯王、列侯每人家马八匹，二千石的官吏黄金二斤，官吏百姓每户一百钱。遣散宫女回家，免除她们终身的赋税徭役。

二月癸酉日，安葬在阳陵。

班固评论说：孔子说“这些百姓，是三代能实行直道的原因”，确实如此啊！

周、秦的弊病，是法网严密条文苛峻，可是犯法作乱的人却防不胜防。

汉朝兴起，废除繁琐苛刻的法令，让百姓休养生息。

到了孝文帝，加上恭敬节俭，孝景帝遵循大业，五六十年间，达到了移风易俗，百姓淳朴忠厚的境界。

周朝称道成、康，汉朝称道文、景，多么美好啊！</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-ching was the Heir-apparent of Emperor Wen. His mother was called the Empress [née] Tou.

In the seventh year of the latter [part of Emperor Wen's reign], in the sixth month, Emperor Wen died; on [the day] ting-wei the Heir-apparent took the imperial throne. He honored the Empress Dowager née Po, entitling her the Grand Dowager Empress. The Empress [née Tou] was entitled the Empress Dowager.

In the ninth month a comet appeared in the western quarter [of the sky].

In the first year, in the winter, the tenth month, an imperial edict said, "We have indeed heard that the ancients regarded as founder him who achieves great deeds and as exemplar him who possesses virtue. In establishing rites and music, each [element of the ceremonies] should have its corresponding motive.

Songs are the means of expressing virtue. Dances are the means of manifesting great deeds.

When, in the Temple of Kao-[tsu], the eighth month wine [is offered], there are performed the Dances of Military Virtue, of the Peaceful Beginning, and of the Five Elements.

When, in the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui, the eighth month wine is offered, there are performed the Dances of the Peaceful Beginning, and of the Five Elements.

"When Emperor Hsiao-wen administered the empire, he opened [free] the [customs] barriers and bridges, making no difference between [near and] distant regions; he suppressed [the punishments for] speaking ill and criticizing, and did away with mutilating punishments; he bestowed and granted [pensions] to elders and the aged; he took care of and pitied the orphans and the childless, in order to satisfy [the desires of all] living [persons]. He restrained his likes and desires and did not receive any presents, not enriching himself with [such] advantages. [In the punishment] of criminals [he did not involve] their wives and children; he did not punish those who had committed no crimes; he suppressed the punishment of castration, and sent the Beauties [of Emperor Hui] out [of the palace to their homes, because] he considered important the cutting off of these persons' posterity.

"Since We are not intelligent, [We] are not able to know everything.

[It however appears to Us] that these things were all beyond the attainment of previous generations, yet they have been achieved by Emperor Hsiao-wen himself.

The depth of his virtue was equal to that of Heaven and Earth; the benefits of his favor were extended to [the borders of] the four seas, [so that] no one failed to receive happiness.

His brilliance was like that of the sun and moon, yet the music in the [imperial ancestral] temple is inadequate [to express it]. We are very much awed.

Let there be made for the Temple of Emperor Hsiao-wen the Dance of Glorious Virtue, in order to make manifest his praiseworthy virtue.

Then only the glory and virtue of the founder and exemplar will be exhibited for ten thousand generations, for ever and ever without end. We approve most highly of this.

Let [the proper officials], with the Lieutenant Chancellor [Shen-t'u Chia], the marquises, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, and the officials [set over] the rites, prepare a memorial concerning these rites and observances."

[In reply], "the Lieutenant Chancellor, your subject [Shen-t'u] Chia" and others memorialized [the Emperor], saying, "Your Majesty is always thinking of the Way of filial piety and has established the Dance of Glorious Virtue in order to make manifest the abundant virtue of Emperor Hsiao-wen. The stupidity of us, your subjects, [Shen-t'u] Chia and the others, prevents us from attaining to all [these matters].

Your servants have carefully discussed [this matter], and say:

"In achievements, no one has been greater than Emperor Kao-[tsu]; in virtue, no one has been more abundant than Emperor Hsiao-wen—the Temple of Emperor Kao-[tsu] should be made the Temple of the Great Founder of Emperors and the Temple of Emperor Hsiao-wen should be made the Temple of the Great Exemplar of Emperors.

The Son of Heaven should from generation to generation make offerings in the Temples of the [Great] Founder and of the [Great] Exemplar.

The commanderies, the kingdoms, and the nobles should each establish a Temple of the Great Exemplar for Emperor Hsiao-wen;

delegates from the vassal kings and the marquises should attend at the sacrifices which the Son of Heaven offers [yearly] in the Temples of the [Great] Founder and of the [Great] Exemplar.

We beg that this be proclaimed and published to the world."

[The Emperor's] decree said, "It may be done."

In the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "Recently, for successive years there have not been good harvests, so that many people are lacking food; early death is cutting short their natural [span of] years. We are very much pained at this [circumstance]."

In some of the commanderies and kingdoms there are stony and narrow [regions] and there is no place for agriculture or sericulture or the feeding and rearing [of domestic animals], [whereas] in other [commanderies and kingdoms] there are fertile and broad regions, abundant in tall grass, and the streams and wells are advantageous, yet the people have not been allowed to migrate [to these places]."

Let it be discussed that the people who wish to migrate to [such] broad and large regions may be permitted to do so."

In the autumn, the seventh month, an imperial edict said, "When officials receive food or drink from those who are superintended or governed by them, dismissal [from their positions and noble ranks is too] heavy [a punishment]; when they receive valuables and articles [from such persons], or when they purchase [things] cheaply and sell dearly, their sentences have been [too] light. [Let] the Commandant of Justice discuss [this matter] anew with the Lieutenant Chancellor [in order to establish] a statutory ordinance."

The Commandant of Justice Hsin carefully discussed [the matter] with the Lieutenant Chancellor [Shen-t'u Chia], and said, "If an official or anyone who has [official] rank has received anything from his official subordinates, whether from those superintended by him, or those under his rule, or those of whom he is [temporarily] in charge, or those whom he commands [as a military leader], let those who have received food or drink and who calculate [its value] and repay this expense not be tried [for crime;

those who receive] other things, [not food or drink, and officials who] have purposely bought things cheap and purposely sold them dear must all be sentenced for having received bribes, and treated as robbers; their bribes shall be confiscated and paid to the government.

If officials have been removed, exiled, dismissed, or their offices discontinued, and receive from their former official subordinates who have been under their [military] command or under their superintendency or control, the gift of any valuables or things sent them, their noble ranks shall be taken away from them and they shall be made common soldiers, [but] shall be relieved of [any further punishment].

If they have no noble rank, they shall be fined [the equivalent of] two catties of gold and it shall be ordered that [the amount] they have received shall be confiscated and paid [into the treasury].

Anyone who is able to arrest or inform [of bribery] shall be given [the amount of] the bribe which is received [by the accused]."

Let [Chi T'ung]-chia be pardoned and be [again] made Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, and, together with his wife and children, who should be condemned with him, let him be restored to his former noble rank;

let [Chi] K'uei-yüeh, together with his wife and children, be sentenced according to the law."

In the summer, the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Recently the King of Wu, [Liu] P'i, and others, rebelled and raised their troops to coerce [Us], leading astray their officials and people. Their officials and people could not do otherwise [than follow them]. Now that [Liu] P'i and the others have already been exterminated, let the officials and people who should be sentenced [for being accomplices of Liu] P'i and the others, together with those who have absconded and fled or deserted the army, all be pardoned.

[With regard to Liu] Yi, the son of King Yüan of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], and others, who rebelled with [Liu] P'i and the others, We cannot bear to apply the law [to them]. Let [their names] be expunged from the register [of the imperial house] and do not let them defile the imperial house. We establish the Marquis of P'ing-lu, Liu Li, as King of Ch'u, to continue the posterity of King Yüan."

In the ninth month, an imperial edict said, "The laws and ordinances, the measures and weights are for the purpose of preventing violence and of stopping wrongdoing.

Some of the officials do not uphold the laws and ordinances: they make a business of presents and bribes; they form parties and cliques and practise favoritism; they consider merciless inquisition as penetration and exacting cruelty as perspicacity, so that they cause the innocent to lose their positions (We pity them greatly), and the guilty do not suffer for their crimes.

They violate the laws and act tyrranously. It is utterly unspeakable.

Whenever a judicial case is doubtful, although [the decision] may have been made out as if it fits the law, if yet it does not satisfy peoples' minds, [the case] shall be specially referred to a superior."

In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, [the Emperor] travelled and favored Yung [with a visit, where he] performed the suburban sacrifice at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].

and in the summer, the fourth month, the King of Liang, [Liu Wu], died. [The Emperor] divided Liang into five kingdoms and established all the five sons of King Hsiao [Liu Wu] as kings.

In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "Now the officials are the teachers of the people. It is proper for their carriages and quadrigae, their clothes and robes to be proportionate [to their station].

Officials [ranking at] six hundred piculs and above are all important officials. Persons negligent of the rules sometimes do not [wear] their official robes, so that when they go in and out of the villages they [appear] no different from the common people.

[We] order that on the carriages of important officials [who are ranked at] two thousand piculs, both side-screens should be made vermillion; and on those [of officials whose positions are ranked from] one thousand to six hundred piculs the left screen should be made vermillion.

If their carriages or the horsemen in their retinue are not proportionate to the office [of their master], or if the robes of petty officials, when they go out and in the hamlets, are not according to their official dignity, [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs should report what are the offices to which [such officials] belong; [in the capital districts] the Three Adjuncts should report any who do not act in accordance with the laws and ordinances [on this point]. All shall be reported to the Lieutenant Chancellor or [Grandee] Secretary, who shall beg [the throne to order them punished]."

Previous to this time most of the officials [had owed their appointments to] their military achievement, so they had paid scant attention to their carriages and robes, hence [the Emperor] made this prohibition. He moreover reflected that cruel officials, using the sanction of the law, might depart from equity, hence he issued an imperial edict [ordering] that the high officials should [propose] a law lightening [the punishment] of beating, and an ordinance fixing [the size of] the stick. [An account of this is] in the "Monograph on Punishments and Laws."

In the sixth month, the Huns entered into the Yen-men [Commandery] to Wu-ch'üan, and entered into the Shang Commandery, where they took the horses of the imperial pastures. Two thousand officers and soldiers died in battle.

and in the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-hai, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the last [part of the Emperor's reign], the first year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "A trial at law is an important matter. [Some] people are wise and [some are] stupid; [some] offices are superior and [some] inferior.

When, in a trial it is doubtful [what to decide, the case] should be referred to the high officials; what the high officials cannot settle should be transferred to the Commandant of Justice.

If it is ordered that a matter should be referred [to a superior judge], and later [it is found that] it should not have been referred, [that reference] does not constitute a fault. [We] desire to bring it about that those who judge lawsuits should above all take care to be lenient."

In the third month, an amnesty was granted to the empire, the common people were granted one step in noble rank, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs and Chancellors of the nobles [were granted] the noble rank of Senior Chiefs of the Summer Multitude.

In the summer, universal drinking [was allowed] for five days and the people were permitted to buy and sell wine.

In the fifth month there was an earthquake.

In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] yi-szŭ, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

and the Marquis of T'iao, Chou Ya-fu, was sent to prison, where he died.

In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, [the Emperor] dispensed with the marquises going to their states.

In the spring the Huns entered into the Yen-men [Commandery] and its Grand Administrator, Feng Ching, died in battle with them. Chariots, cavalry, and skilled soldiers were sent to garrison [the Yen-men Commandery].

In the spring, because in the [previous] year there had not been a [good] harvest, in the commanderies under [the Prefects] of the [Imperial] Capital, feeding horses with grain was prohibited and they were confiscated to the government.

In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial edict said, "Carved ornaments and chiseled engravings are matters that injure agriculture. Brocade, embroidery, vermillion silk ribbons, and braided ribbons harm women's work.

Injury to agriculture is the source of hunger; harm to women's work is the cause of [suffering from] cold.

Verily when hunger and cold both come at the same time, there are few who will be able to keep from doing wrong.

We Ourself plow and the Empress herself cultivates silkworms in order to lead the empire by furnishing the millet, the sacrifical grain, and the sacrificial robes for the [imperial] ancestral temples. [We] have not accepted the [yearly] offerings; [We] have reduced [the supplies of] the Grand Provisioner; [We] have diminished the amount of public service and the poll-taxes, wishing that the empire should stress agriculture and sericulture and should constantly have stores and provisions in order to be prepared for visitations and calamities, the strong should not rob from the weak, the many should not do violence to the few, the aged and those over sixty should die a natural death, and the young and orphans should be allowed to grow to maturity.

[so that] the strong should not rob from the weak, the many should not do violence to the few, the aged and those over sixty should die a natural death, and the young and orphans should be allowed to grow to maturity.

Now for some years there have not been good harvests and the food of the common people has been quite scanty; where does the fault lie?

Perhaps dishonest and hypocritical officials make a business of presents and bribes, taking by fraud or by force the peoples' [property], encroaching upon and consuming the many common people.

An Assistant Prefect is a Chief Official; [for him] to pervert the laws and rob with the robbers is utterly unspeakable.

Let it be ordered that [officials whose positions rank as] two thousand piculs should each look after their own charge. As to those who do not occupy themselves with their official duties or who govern unintelligently, the Lieutenant Chancellor should report it and beg [the throne to order them punished] for their crimes.

Let this be published and told to the empire and cause Our will to be clearly known."

In the fifth month, an imperial edict said, "A person should not be disquieted if he is ignorant, [but] he should be disquieted if he acts deceitfully. He should not be disquieted if he is not brave, [but] he should be disquieted if he acts tyrannously. He should not be disquieted if he is not rich, [but] he should be disquieted if he is not satisfied [i.e., is covetous].

Only incorrupt gentlemen make their desires few and are easily satisfied.

Now [a person must have] capital [sufficient to be required to pay at least] ten or more [times] the poll-tax before he is permitted to become a palace official. The [number of] poll-taxes [which can be paid by] incorrupt gentlemen are not inevitably many.

Those who are enregistered in the market-places [as merchants] are not allowed to become palace officials, so those who have not [sufficient] capital are also not allowed to become palace officials. We very much deplore this.

If the capital [of incorrupt gentlemen is sufficient so that they pay] four [times] the poll-tax, they shall be allowed to become palace officials, so as not to let incorrupt persons be kept for a long time from office and covetous fellows to profit continuously."

In the autumn there was a great drought.

In the third year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the foundation of the world. As to real gold, pearls, or jade, when one is hungry, they cannot be eaten; when one is cold, they cannot be worn. They are considered and used as objects of value, [but] one does not understand how their final or original [value came to be].

Recently for some years there have not been good harvests. In [Our] opinion this is because those who do non-essential things [merchanizing and craftsmanship] are many, [whereas] the common people who make agriculture [their profession] are few.

Let it be ordered that the commanderies and kingdoms shall stress the encouragement of agriculture and sericulture, and increase the sowing and planting, [in order that] there may [thus] be obtained articles for clothing and food.

If officials, in mobilizing the common people or in taking from them substitute-[money, employ them] to collect real gold, pearls, or jade, [such officials] shall be condemned [as having taken] booty and treated as robbers. [Officials ranking at] two thousand piculs who permit [such actions, shall be punished] with the same punishment [as other officials]."

The Imperial Heir-apparent [Liu Ch'ê] was capped, and those people who would be the successors of their fathers were granted one step in noble rank.

On [the day] chia-tzu, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Palace.

In his testamentary edict, he granted to the vassal kings and to the marquises two teams of four horses each, to officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs, two catties of actual gold, and to the [lower] officials and the common people, a hundred cash to each household. He freed the women of the [imperial] harem and sent them back to their families, exempting their persons [from taxation] for life.

In the second month, on [the day] kuei-yu, he was buried in the Yang Tomb.

In eulogy we say: Confucius eulogized, "These people! They are whereby the three dynasties pursued their straight course." It was true indeed;

the error of the Chou and the Ch'in [dynasties] was that although the net [of their laws] was fine and their enactments were severe, yet they could not overcome the ways of the wicked.

When the Han [dynasty] arose, it swept away [such] vexations and harshness and gave the common people repose and rest.

[Emperor] Hsiao-wen added [the virtues of] respectfulness and frugality; [Emperor] Hsiao-ching followed his practises. In the course of fifty or sixty years, [these Emperors even] altered the people's customs and changed their usages, [so that] the many common people became pure and sincere.

The Chou [dynasty] talked about [Kings] Ch'eng and K'ang; the Han [dynasty similarly] speaks of [Emperors] Wen and Ching. How splendid!</div>
