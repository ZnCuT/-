          <div class="txt">五年冬十月，汉王追项羽至阳夏南，止军，与齐王信、魏相国越期会击楚。

至固陵，不会。

楚击汉军，大破之，汉王复入壁，深堑而守。

谓张良曰：“诸侯不从，奈何？”

良对曰：“楚兵且破，未有分地，其不至固宜。

君王能与共天下，可立致也。

齐王信之立，非君王意，信亦不自坚。

彭越本定梁地，始，君王以魏豹故，拜越为相国。

今豹死，越亦望王，而君王不早定。

今能取睢阳以北至谷城皆以王彭越，从陈以东傅海与齐王信，信家在楚，其意欲复得故邑。

能出捐此地以许两人，使各自为战，则楚易散也”。

于是汉王发使使韩信、彭越。

至，皆引兵来。

十一月，刘贾入楚地，围寿春。

汉亦遣人诱楚大司马周殷。

殷畔楚，以舒屠六，举九江兵迎黥布，并行屠城父，随刘贾皆会。

十二月，围羽垓下。

羽夜闻汉军四面皆楚歌，知尽得楚地。

羽与数百骑走，是以兵大败。

灌婴追斩羽东城。

楚地悉定，独鲁不下。

汉王引天下兵欲屠之，为其守节礼义之国，乃持羽头示其父兄，鲁乃降。

初，怀王封羽为鲁公，及死，鲁又为之坚守，故以鲁公葬羽于谷城。

汉王为发丧，哭临而去。

封项伯等四人为列侯，赐姓刘氏。

诸民略在楚者皆归之。

汉王还至定陶，驰入齐王信壁，夺其军。

初项羽所立临江王共敖前死，子尉嗣立为王，不降。

遣卢绾、刘贾击虏尉。

春正月，追尊兄伯号曰武哀侯。

下令曰：“楚地已定，义帝亡后，欲存恤楚众，以定其主。

齐王信习楚风俗，更立为楚王，王淮北，都下邳。

魏相国建城侯彭越勤劳魏民，卑下士卒，常以少击众，数破楚军，其以魏故地王之，号曰梁王，都定陶。”

又曰：“兵不得休八年，万民与苦甚，今天下事毕，其赦天下殊死以下。”

于是诸侯上疏曰：“楚王韩信、韩王信、淮南王英布、梁王彭越、故衡山王吴芮、赵王张敖、燕王臧荼昧死再拜言大王陛下：

先时，秦为亡道，天下诛之。

大王先得秦王，定关中，于天下功最多。

存亡定危，救败继绝，以安万民，功盛德厚。

又加惠于诸侯王有功者，使得立社稷。

地分已定，而位号比拟，亡上下之分，大王功德之著，于后世不宣。

昧死再拜上皇帝尊号。”

汉王曰：“寡人闻帝者贤者有也，虚言亡实之名，非所取也。

今诸侯王皆推高寡人，将何以处之哉？”

诸侯王皆曰：“大王起于细微，灭乱秦，威动海内。

又以辟陋之地，自汉中行威德，诛不义，立有功，平定海内，功臣皆受地食邑，非私之地。

大王德施四海，诸侯王不足以道之，居帝位甚实宜，愿大王以幸天下。”

汉王曰：“诸侯王幸以为便于天下之民，则可矣。”

于是诸侯王及太尉长安侯臣绾等三百人，与博士稷嗣君叔孙通谨择良日二月甲午，上尊号。

汉王即皇帝位于汜水之阳。

尊王后曰皇后，太子曰皇太子，追尊先媪曰昭灵夫人。

诏曰：“故衡山王吴芮与子二人、兄子一人，从百粤之兵，以佐诸侯，诛暴秦，有大功，诸侯立以为王。

项羽侵夺之地，谓之番君。

其以长沙、豫章、象郡、桂林、南海立番君芮为长沙王。”

又曰：“故粤王亡诸世奉粤祀，秦侵夺其地，使其社稷不得血食。

诸侯伐秦，亡诸身帅闽中兵以助灭秦，项羽废而弗立。

今以为闽粤王，王闽中地，勿使失职。”

帝乃西都洛阳。

夏五月，兵皆罢归家。

诏曰：“诸侯子在关中者，复之十二岁，其归者半之。

民前或相聚保山泽，不书名数，今天下已定，令各归其县，复故爵田宅，吏以文法教训辨告，勿笞辱。

民以饥饿自卖为人奴婢者，皆免为庶人。

军吏卒会赦，甚亡罪而亡爵及不满大夫者，皆赐爵为大夫。

故大夫以上，赐爵各一级。

其七大夫以上，皆令食邑；非七大夫以下，皆复其身及户，勿事。”

又曰：“七大夫、公乘以上，皆高爵也。

诸侯子及从军归者，甚多高爵，吾数诏吏先与田宅，及所当求于吏者，亟与。

爵或人君，上所尊礼，久立吏前，曾不为决，其亡谓也。

异日秦民爵公大夫以上，令丞与亢礼。

今吾于爵非轻也，吏独安取此！

且法以有功劳行田宅，今小吏未尝从军者多满，而有功者顾不得，背公立私，守尉长吏教训甚不善。

其令诸吏善遇高爵，称吾意。

且廉问，有不如吾诏者，以重论之。”

帝置酒雒阳南宫。

上曰：“通侯诸将毋敢隐朕，皆言其情。

吾所以有天下者何？项氏之所以失天下者何？”

高起、王陵对曰：“陛下嫚而侮人，项羽仁而敬人。

然陛下使人攻城略地，所降下者，因以与之，与天下同利也。

项羽妒贤嫉能，有功者害之，贤者疑之，战胜而不与人功，得地而不与人利，此其所以失天下也。”

上曰：“公知其一，未知其二。

夫运筹帷幄之中，决胜千里之外，吾不如子房；

填国家，抚百姓，给饷馈，不绝粮道，吾不如萧何；

连百万之众，战必胜，攻必取，吾不如韩信。

三者皆人杰，吾能用之，此吾所以取天下者也。

项羽有一范增而不能用，此所以为我禽也。”

群臣说服。

初，田横归彭越。

项羽已灭，横惧诛，与宾客亡入海。

上恐其久为乱，遣使者赦横，曰：“横来，大者王，小者侯；不来，且发兵加诛。”

横惧，乘传诣雒阳，未至三十里，自杀。

上壮其节，为流涕，发卒二千人，以上礼葬焉。

戍卒娄敬求见，说上曰：“陛下取天下与周异，而都雒阳，不便，不如入关，据秦之固。”

上以问张良，良因劝上。

是日，车驾西都长安。

拜娄敬为奉春君，赐姓刘氏。

六月壬辰，大赦天下。

秋七月，燕王臧荼反，上自将征之。

九月，虏荼。

诏诸侯王视有功者立以为燕王。

荆王臣信等十人皆曰：“太尉长安侯卢绾功最多，请立以为燕王。”

使丞相哙将兵平代地。

利几反，上自击破之。

利几者，项羽将。

羽败，利几为陈令，降，上侯之颍川。

上至雒阳，举通侯籍召之，而利几恐，反。

后九月，徙诸侯子关中。

治长乐宫。

六年冬十月，令天下县邑城。

人告楚王信谋反，上问左右，左右争欲击之。

用陈平计，乃伪游云梦。

十二月，会诸侯于陈，楚王信迎谒，因执之。

诏曰：“天下既安，豪桀有功者封侯，新立，未能尽图其功。

身居军九年，或未习法令，或以其故犯法，大者死刑，吾甚怜之。

其赦天下。”

田肯贺上曰：“甚善，陛下得韩信，又治秦中。

秦，形胜之国也，带河阻山，县隔千里，持戟百万，秦得百二焉。

地势便利，其以下兵于诸侯，譬犹居高屋之上建瓴水也。

夫齐，东有琅邪、即墨之饶，南有泰山之固，西有浊河之限，北有勃海之利，地方二千里，持戟百万，县隔千里之外，齐得十二焉，此东西秦也。

非亲子弟，莫可使王齐者。”

上曰：“善。”

赐金五百斤。

上还至雒阳，赦韩信，封为淮阴侯。

甲申，始剖符封功臣曹参等为通侯。

诏曰：“齐，古之建国也，今为郡县，其复以为诸侯。

将军刘贾数有大功，及择宽惠修絜者，王齐、荆地。”

春正月丙午，韩王信等奏请以故东阳郡、鄣郡、吴郡五十三县立刘贾为荆王；

以砀郡、薛郡、郯郡三十六县立弟文信君交为楚王。

壬子，以云中、雁门、代郡五十三县立兄宜信侯喜为代王；

以胶东、胶西、临淄、济北、博阳、城阳郡七十三县立子肥为齐王；

以太原郡三十一县为韩国，徙韩王信都晋阳。

上已封大功臣二十余人，其余争功，未得行封。

上居南宫，从复道上见诸将往往耦语，以问张良。

良曰：“陛下与此属共取天下，今已为天子，而所封皆故人所爱，所诛皆平生仇怨。

今军吏计功，以天下为不足用遍封，而恐以过失及诛，故相聚谋反耳。”

上曰：“为之奈何？”

良曰：“取上素所不快，计群臣所共知最甚者一人，先封以示群臣。”

三月，上置酒，封雍齿，因趣丞相急定功行封。

罢酒，群臣皆喜，曰：“雍齿且侯，吾属亡患矣！”

上归栎阳，五日一朝太公。

太公家令说太公曰：“天亡二日，土亡二王。

皇帝虽子，人主也；太公虽父，人臣也。

奈何令人主拜人臣！如此，则威重不行。”

后上朝，太公拥彗，迎门却行。

上大惊，下扶太公。

太公曰：“帝，人主，奈何以我乱天下法！”

于是上心善家令言，赐黄金五百斤。

夏五月丙午，诏曰：“人之至亲，莫亲于父子，故父有天下传归于子，子有天下尊归于父，此人道之极也。

前日天下大乱，兵革并起，万民苦殃，朕亲被坚执锐，自帅士卒，犯危难，平暴乱，立诸侯，偃兵息民，天下大安，此皆太公之教训也。

诸王、通侯、将军、群卿、大夫已尊朕为皇帝，而太公未有号，今上尊太公曰太上皇。”

秋九月，匈奴围韩王信于马邑，信降匈奴。

七年冬十月，上自将击韩王信于铜鞮，斩其将。

信亡走匈奴，其将曼丘臣、王黄共立故赵后赵利为王，收信散兵，与匈奴共距汉。

上从晋阳连战，乘胜逐北，至楼烦，会大寒，士卒堕指者什二三。

遂至平城，为匈奴所围，七日，用陈平秘计得出。

使樊哙留定代地。

十二月，上还过赵，不礼赵王。

是月，匈奴攻代，代王喜弃国，自归雒阳，赦为合阳侯。

辛卯，立子如意为代王。

春，令郎中有罪耐以上，请之。

民产子，复勿事二岁。

二月，至长安。

萧何治未央宫，立东阙、北阙、前殿、武库、大仓。

上见其壮丽，甚怒，谓何曰：“天下匈匈，劳苦数岁，成败未可知，是何治宫室过度也！”

何曰：“天下方未定，故可因以就宫室。

且夫天子以四海为家，非令壮丽亡以重威，且亡令后世有以加也。”

上说。

自栎阳徙都长安。

置宗正官以序九族。

夏四月，行如雒阳。

八年冬，上东击韩信余寇于东垣。

还过赵，赵相贯高等耻上不礼其王，阴谋欲弑上。

上欲宿，心动，问“县名何？曰：“柏人。”

上曰：“柏人者，迫于人也。”去弗宿。

十一月，令士卒从军死者，为槥归其县，县给衣衾棺葬具，祠以少牢，长吏视葬。

十二月，行自东垣至。

春三月，行如雒阳。

令吏卒从军至平城及守城邑者皆复终身勿事。

爵非公乘以上毋得冠刘氏冠。

贾人毋得衣锦、绣、绮、縠、絺、纻、罽，操兵，乘骑马。

秋八月，吏有罪未发觉者，赦之。

九月，行自雒阳至。

淮南王、梁王、赵王、楚王皆从。

九年冬十月，淮南王、梁王、赵王、楚王朝未央宫。

置酒前殿，上奉玉卮为太上皇寿，曰：“始大人常以臣亡赖，不能治产业，不如仲力。

今某之业所就孰与仲多？”

殿上群臣皆称万岁，大笑为乐。

十一月，徙齐、楚大族昭氏、屈氏、景氏、怀氏、田氏五姓关中，与利田宅。

十二月，行如雒阳。

贯高等谋逆发觉，逮捕高等，并捕赵王敖下狱。

诏敢有随王，罪三族。

郎中田叔、孟舒等十人自髡钳为王家奴，从王就狱。

王实不知其谋。

春正月，废赵王敖为宣平侯。

徙代王如意为赵王，王赵国。

丙寅，前有罪殊死以下皆赦之。

二月，行自雒阳至。

贤赵臣田叔、孟舒等十人，召见与语，汉廷臣无能出其右者。

上说，尽拜为郡守、诸侯相。

夏六月乙未晦，日有食之。

十年冬十月，淮南王、燕王、荆王、梁王、楚王、齐王、长沙王来朝。

夏五月，太上皇后崩。

秋七月癸卯，太上皇崩，葬万年。

赦栎阳囚死罪以下。

八月，令诸侯王皆立太上皇庙于国都。

九月，代相国陈豨反。

上曰：“豨尝为吾使，甚有信。

代地吾所急，故封豨为列侯，以相国守代，今乃与王黄等劫掠代地！

吏民非有罪也，能去豨、黄来归者，皆赦之。”

上自东，至邯郸。

上喜曰：“豨不南据邯郸而阻漳水，吾知其亡能为矣。”

赵相周昌奏常山二十五城亡其二十城，请诛守、尉。

上曰：“守、尉反乎？”对曰：“不。”

上曰：“是力不足，亡罪。”

上令周昌选赵壮士可令将者，白见四人。

上嫚骂曰：“竖子能为将乎！”

四人惭，皆伏地。

上封各千户，以为将。

左右谏曰：“从入蜀、汉，伐楚，赏未遍行，今封此，何功？”

上曰：“非汝所知。

陈豨反，赵、代地皆豨有。

吾以羽檄征天下兵，未有至者，今计唯独邯郸中兵耳。

吾何爱四千户，不以慰赵子弟！”

皆曰：“善。”

又求：“乐毅有后乎？”得其孙叔，封之乐乡，号华成君。

问豨将，皆故贾人。

上曰：“吾知与之矣。”

乃多以金购豨将，豨将多降。

十一年冬，上在邯郸。

豨将侯敞将万余人游行，王黄将骑千余军曲逆，张春将卒万余人度河攻聊城。

汉将军郭蒙与齐将击，大破之。

太尉周勃道太原入定代地，至马邑，马邑不下，攻残之。

豨将赵利守东垣，高祖攻之不下。

卒骂，上怒。

城降，卒骂者斩之。

诸县坚守不降反寇者，复租赋三岁。

春正月，淮阴侯韩信谋反长安，夷三族。

将军柴武斩韩王信于参合。

上还雒阳。

诏曰：“代地居常山之北，与夷狄边，赵乃从山南有之，远，数有胡寇，难以为国。

颇取山南太原之地益属代，代之云中以西为云中郡，则代受边寇益少矣。

王、相国、通侯、吏二千石择可立为代王者。”

燕王绾、相国何等三十三人皆曰：“子恒贤知温良，请立以为代王，都晋阳。”

大赦天下。

二月，诏曰：“欲省赋甚。

今献未有程，吏或多赋以为献，而诸侯王尤多，民疾之。

令诸侯王、通侯常以十月朝献，即郡各以其口数率，人岁六十三钱，以给献费。”

又曰：“盖闻王者莫高于周文，伯者莫高于齐桓，皆待贤人而成名。

今天下贤者智能，岂特古之人乎？

患在人主不交故也，士奚由进！

今吾以天之灵、贤士大夫定有天下，以为一家，欲其长久，世世奉宗庙亡绝也。

贤人已与我共平之矣，而不与吾共安利之，可乎？

贤士大夫有肯从我游者，吾能尊显之。

布告天下，使明知朕意。

御史大夫昌下相国，相国酂侯下诸侯王，御史中执法下郡守，其有意称明德者，必身劝，为之驾，遣诣相国府，署行、义、年。

有而弗言，觉，免。

年老癃病，勿遣。”

三月，梁王彭越谋反，夷三族。

诏曰：“择可以为梁王、淮阳王者。”

燕王绾、相国何等请立子恢为梁王，子友为淮阳王。

罢东郡，颇益梁；罢颍川郡，颇益淮阳。

夏四月，行自雒阳至。

令丰人徙关中者皆复终身。

五月，诏曰：“粤人之俗，好相攻击，前时秦徙中县之民南方三郡，使与百粤杂处。

会天下诛秦，南海尉它居南方长治之，甚有文理，中县人以故不耗减，粤人相攻击之俗益止，俱赖其力。

今立它为南粤王。”

使陆贾即授玺、绶。

它稽首称臣。

六月，令士卒从入蜀、汉、关中者皆复终身。

秋七月，淮南王布反。

上问诸将，滕公言故楚令尹薛公有筹策。

上召见，薛公言布形势，上善之，封薛公千户。

诏王、相国择可立为淮南王者，群臣请立子长为王。

上乃发上郡、北地、陇西车骑，巴、蜀材官及中尉卒三万人为皇太子卫，军霸上。

布果如薛公言，东击杀荆王刘贾，劫其兵，度淮击楚，楚王交走入薛。

上赦天下死罪以下，皆令从军；征诸侯兵，上自将以击布。

十二年冬十月，上破布军于会缶。

布走，令别将追之。

上还，过沛，留，置酒沛宫，悉召故人父老子弟佐酒。

发沛中兒得百二十人，教之歌。

酒酣，上击筑自歌曰：“大风起兮云飞扬，威加海内兮归故乡，安得猛士兮守四方！”

令兒皆和习之。

上乃起舞，忼慨伤怀，泣数行下。

谓沛父兄曰：“游子悲故乡。

吾虽都关中，万岁之后吾魂魄犹思沛。

且朕自沛公以诛暴逆，遂有天下，其以沛为朕汤沐邑，复其民，世世无有所与。”

沛父老诸母故人日乐饮极欢，道旧故为笑乐。

十余日，上欲去，沛父兄固请。

上曰：“吾人众多，父兄不能给。”乃去。

沛中空县皆之邑西献。

上留止，张饮三日。

沛父兄皆顿首曰：“沛幸得复，丰未得，唯陛下哀矜。”

上曰：“丰者，吾所生长，极不忘耳。

吾特以其为雍齿故反我为魏。”

沛父兄固请之，乃并复丰，比沛。

汉别将击布军洮水南北，皆大破之，追斩布番阳。

周勃定代，斩陈豨于当城。

诏曰：“吴，古之建国也。

日者荆王兼有其地，今死亡后。

朕欲复立吴王，其议可者。”

长沙王臣等言：“沛侯濞重厚，请立为吴王。”

已拜，上召谓濞曰：“汝状有反相。”

因拊其背，曰：“汉后五十年东南有乱，岂汝邪？

然天下同姓一家，汝慎毋反。”

濞顿首曰：“不敢。”

十一月，行自淮南还。

过鲁，以大牢祠孔子。

十二月，诏曰：“秦皇帝、楚隐王、魏安釐王、齐愍王、赵悼襄王皆绝亡后。

其与秦始皇帝守冢二十家，楚、魏、齐各十家，赵及魏公子亡忌各五家，令视其冢，复，亡与它事。”

陈豨降将言豨反时燕王卢绾使人之豨所阴谋。

上使辟阳侯审食其迎绾，绾称疾。

食其言绾反有端。

春二月，使樊哙、周勃将兵击绾。

诏曰：“燕王绾与吾有故，爱之如子，闻与陈豨有谋，吾以为亡有，故使人迎绾。

绾称疾不来，谋反明矣。

燕吏民非有罪也，赐其吏六百石以上爵各一级。

与绾居，去来归者，赦之，加爵亦一级。”

诏诸侯王议可立为燕王者。

长沙王臣等请立子建为燕王。

诏曰：“南武侯织亦粤之世也，立以为南海王。”

三月，诏曰：“吾立为天子，帝有天下，十二年于今矣。

与天下之豪士贤大夫共定天下，同安辑之。

其有功者上致之王，次为列侯，下乃食邑。

而重臣之亲，或为列侯，皆令自置吏，得赋敛，女子公主。

为列侯食邑者，皆佩之印，赐大第室。

吏二千石，徙之长安，受小第室。

入蜀、汉定三秦者，皆世世复。

吾于天下贤士功臣，可谓亡负矣。

其有不义背天子擅起兵者，与天下共伐诛之。

布告天下，使明知朕意。”

上击布时，为流矢所中，行道疾。

疾甚，吕后迎良医。

医入见，上问医。

曰：“疾可治。”

于是上嫚骂之，曰：“吾以布衣提三尺取天下，此非天命乎？

命乃在天，虽扁鹊何益！”

遂不使治疾，赐黄金五十斤，罢之。

吕后问曰：“陛下百岁后，萧相国既死，谁令代之？”

上曰：“曹参可。”

问其次，曰：“王陵可，然少戆，陈平可以助之。

陈平知有余，然难独任。

周勃重厚少文，然安刘氏者必勃也，可令为太尉。”

吕后复问其次，上曰：“此后亦非乃所知也。”

卢绾与数千人居塞下候伺，幸上疾愈，自入谢。

夏四月甲辰，帝崩于长乐宫。

卢绾闻之，遂亡入匈奴。

吕后与审食其谋曰：“诸将故与帝为编户民，北面为臣，心常鞅鞅，今乃事少主，非尽族是，天下不安。”

以故不发丧。

人或闻，以语郦商。

郦商见审食其曰：“闻帝已崩四日，不发丧，欲诛诸将。

诚如此，天下危矣。

陈平、灌婴将十万守荥阳，樊哙、周勃将二十万定燕、代，此闻帝崩，诸将皆诛，必连兵还乡，以攻关中。

大臣内畔，诸将外反，亡可跷足待也。”

审食其入言之，乃以丁未发丧，大赦天下。

五月丙寅，葬长陵。

已下，皇太子、群臣皆反至太上皇庙。

群臣曰：“帝起细微，拨乱世反之正，平定天下，为汉太祖，功最高。”

上尊号曰高皇帝。

初，高祖不修文学，而性明达，好谋，能听，自监门戍卒，见之如旧。

初顺民心作三章之约。

天下既定，命萧何次律令，韩信申军法，张苍定章程，叔孙通制礼仪，陆贾造《新语》。

又与功臣剖符作誓，丹书铁契，金匮石室，藏之宗庙。

虽日不暇给，规摹弘远矣。

赞曰：《春秋》晋史蔡墨有言：陶唐氏既衰，其后有刘累，学扰龙，事孔甲，范氏其后也。

而大夫范宣子亦曰：“祖自虞以上为陶唐氏，在夏为御龙氏，在商为豕韦氏，在周为唐杜氏，晋主夏盟为范氏。”

范氏为晋士师，鲁文公世奔秦。

后归于晋，其处者为刘氏。

刘向云战国时刘氏自秦获于魏。

秦灭魏，迁大梁，都于丰，故周市说雍齿曰：“丰，故梁徙也。”

是以颂高祖云：“汉帝本系，出自唐帝。降及于周，在秦作刘。涉魏而东，遂为丰公。”

丰公，盖太上皇父。

其迁日浅，坟墓在丰鲜焉。

及高祖即位，置祠祀官，则有秦、晋、梁、荆之巫，世祠天地，缀之以祀，岂不信哉！

由是推之，汉承尧运，德祚已盛，断蛇著符，旗帜上赤，协于火德，自然之应，得天统矣。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">高祖五年(前202)冬十月，汉王追逐项羽到阳夏南部，停止前进，与齐王韩信、魏相国彭越约期会师攻击楚兵。

汉王兵至固陵，韩、彭等均未按期会师。

项羽领兵攻击汉王的大军，大败汉兵。汉王收兵回原壁垒，掘深沟以自守。

汉王忧虑地对张良说：“诸侯不愿顺从我们，怎么办？”

张良答道：“楚兵即使被打败，韩信与彭越也不会得到增地的利益，他们不来会师是情理中事。

要是大王能和他们共同分享胜利成果，他们就会马上前来会师。

韩信立为齐王，并非出于大王本意，韩信对于大王还信心不足。

彭越本来平定了梁地，后来大王因为魏王豹来归降的原故，才封彭越为魏相国。

今魏王豹已死，彭越也想自己称王，而大王迟迟不予定夺。

要是现在能划睢阳以北至谷城的地区给彭越并封他为王，划陈以东至于渤海的地区给齐王韩信，韩信家在楚地，他本意想收复自己的乡土。

大王舍弃此二地以许韩、彭二人，让他们各自为战，那楚项就容易打败了。”

于是汉王派使者将上述意向通知韩信、彭越。

通知一到，韩彭都引兵前来会师了。

十一月，刘贾攻入楚地，围困寿春。

汉王又派人诱降楚大司马周殷。

周殷叛楚，以舒县之兵猛攻六县，率领九江之兵配合英布，合兵进击城父县，英布与刘贾都与汉王会师。

高祖五年冬季十二月，汉兵合围项羽于垓下。

项羽夜间听到四面都是楚歌，知道汉兵已经完全控制了楚兵周围阵地。

就率数百骑弃营突围，楚军因无主而大败。

灌婴追斩项羽于东城。

楚地完全平定，唯独鲁地不降。

汉王率领大军想要屠城，但又被该地将士为项羽守节持义之举所感动，就停止进攻，将项羽首级悬示以告知鲁地的父兄，鲁地乃降。

原先，怀王封项羽为鲁公，项羽死后，鲁地又为之坚守，因此就以鲁公的仪式葬项羽于济北谷城。

汉王为项羽发丧，并到灵前哭泣哀悼。

汉王封项伯等四人为列侯，赐刘姓。

外地百姓被掠到楚地的都遣返原籍。

汉王回师到定陶，以迅雷不及掩耳之势进入韩信军营，削夺了韩信的兵权。

原先曾是项羽所立的临江王共敖已死，其子尉继位为王，不肯投降。

汉王派卢绾、刘贾征临江王尉。

汉高祖六年春正月，汉王追尊其兄刘伯为武哀侯。

下令说：“楚地已经平定，义帝无有后代，想安抚楚地民众，就另定楚地之主。

齐王韩信了解楚地风土人情，现改立为楚王。统辖淮北地区，都于下邳。

魏相国建城侯彭越关心魏民，爱护士卒，经常以少击众，几次打败楚军，就将魏故地赐为他的封地，号为梁王，都于定陶。”

在令中又说：“战争已连续八年，给人民造成严重的灾难，今日天下已经统一安定。除已决死刑外的囚犯都一律赦免。”

此时诸侯向汉王上奏：“楚王韩信、韩王信、淮南王英布、梁王彭越、原衡山王吴芮、赵王张敖、燕王臧荼诚惶诚恐冒死上书，大王陛下：

以往秦朝无道，神人共行诛讨。

大王首先俘虏秦王子婴，平定关中，功劳盖于天下。

存亡定危，救败继绝，以安定万民，功高德厚。

同时又施加恩惠于各个有功的侯王，对他们裂土分封。

现在各侯王封地及名分已定，而和大王同称王号，没有尊卑之别，如此则大王显著的高功盛德，就不能宣明于后世。

因此臣等冒死再拜请上皇帝尊号。”

汉王辞谢道：“寡人常闻帝号归于圣贤所有，名不副实的名号，是不应取得的。

今日诸位侯王都推举寡人称帝，寡人怎能领受得起？”

诸位侯王都禀道：“大王崛起于民间，消灭乱秦，威震海内。

后来又以巴蜀偏僻之区为基地，从汉中推行威德，诛讨不义，封立有功，平定海内，功臣都得到封地与食邑，一律论功行赏。

大王的恩德遍于四海，其他侯王都不能与之媲美，尊为皇帝是名实相副，愿大王能满足天下臣民的愿望。”

汉王说：“诸位侯王如果说寡人称帝有利天下人民的话，那寡人就认可了。”

于是各位侯王及太尉长安侯卢绾等三百人，与博士稷嗣君叔孙通谨择吉日二月初三日，上皇帝尊号。

汉王即皇帝位于汜水以北的济阴。

尊吕后为皇后，太子为皇太子，追赠已去世的母亲为昭灵夫人。

汉高祖下诏说：“原衡山王吴芮与子二人，侄子一人，从百粤之区起兵，以支持诸侯，诛灭暴秦，立有大功。诸侯立他为王。

后被项羽侵夺其土地，降称为番君。

现在以长沙、豫章、象林、桂郡、南海等地为他的封地，立番君吴芮为长沙王。”

诏书又说：“前粤王亡诸一直继承粤祀，秦朝夺去了他的土地，使粤的祖先祭祀无人。

诸侯伐秦，亡诸亲率闽中士卒以助灭秦义举，项羽废而不立。

今以亡诸为闽粤王，闽中归其统辖不使失其旧职。”

汉高祖乃西都洛阳。

夏五月，士卒都复员回家。

皇帝下诏说：“诸侯之子弟在关中的，免除十二年赋役，已归还原籍的，免除六年赋役。

以前有的百姓聚逃于山泽之中以避秦乱，未列入户籍，现在天下已定，可以各归本里，恢复原有的爵级与土地房屋，各地官吏要按照法令来晓喻义理，不得强迫侮辱。

百姓中因饥饿自卖为他人奴隶婢女的，都免其奴婢身份而为平民。

前秦的军吏士卒一律免罪，其中没有助秦之罪而无爵级或原爵级不满大夫的，都赐爵为大夫。

原有大夫的爵级的各加一级。

其中七大夫以上的都赐给收取赋税的食邑。爵级在七大夫以下的，都免除本人及家庭的赋税，不服徭役。”

诏书又说：“七大夫、公乘，都是高的爵级。

诸侯子弟及从军复员的，有很多高爵，我已经多次指示主管的官吏先分给他们的田宅，他们对主管官吏所提出的正当要求，要迅速解决。

有爵级的与有食邑的主人，都是皇帝所尊重的，有的人多次请求办事官吏解决问题，却仍然得不到妥善处理，这是不正常的。

往日秦朝的人爵级在七大夫以上的，与县令平起平坐。

现在我对于爵级也看得不轻，有些官吏怎能对爵级如此不尊重！

何况明文规定按功劳付予田宅，今日有些小小官吏毫无军功却先满足自己，而有功的反而不能得到，违背公法而谋取私利，这是郡守、郡尉、县令教育管理不善所致。

要指示办事官吏尊重有高爵级的人，不要有负我的厚望。

还应进行检查，对不按照我的旨意办事的人定要予以重惩。”

高祖皇帝在洛阳南宫举行宴会。

他致祝酒词说：“通侯诸将，不必对我有所隐晦，都请畅所欲言。

我为什么能取得天下？项羽为何失掉天下？”

高起、王陵答道：“陛下平日似乎并不大尊重他人，项羽似乎能关心与尊重他人。

但是陛下派人攻城略地，所取得的战果，都给予有功之人，这是与大家同甘共苦的表现。

而项羽妒贤嫉能，对有功之人进行打击，对贤才之士不愿重用，打了胜仗攘人之功以为己有，得了土地不愿意分赏功臣，这就是他众叛亲离而失败的症结。”

高祖说：“公只知其一，未知其二。

如运筹于帷幄之中，决胜于千里之外，我不及张良；

镇守国家，安抚百姓，供应粮饷，保证粮道畅通，我不及萧何；

指挥百万之众，战无不胜，攻无不取，我不及韩信。

这三位都是旷世俊杰。而我能充分发挥他们的作用，这就是我能夺取天下的原因。

项羽本有一贤才范增，但不能重用，所以他才败在我的手下。”

群臣都心悦诚服。

当初，田横投奔过彭越。

项羽破灭以后，田横害怕被诛讨，就率领部属逃奔到海岛上去。

高祖恐怕以后滋生祸乱，就派使者去宣布赦免田横的命令，赦令说：“田横归来，田横可以封王，其下属可以封侯；要是拒不听令，将派大军进行扫荡。”

田横惶恐，就乘快车急赴洛阳，在离洛阳三十里外，自杀。

高祖被他的节操所感动，为之下泪。派士卒二千人，用王礼予以安葬。

一位边防士卒娄敬求见，他向高祖建议：“陛下取得天下与周朝不同，而建都于洛阳，不太恰当，不如进入函谷关，以据秦川天险。”

高祖与张良商量，张良劝高祖同意娄敬的建议。

即日，皇帝车驾登程赴西都长安。

封娄敬为奉春君，赐姓为刘。

六月八日，大赦天下。

秋七月，燕王臧荼叛汉，高祖御驾亲征。

九月，俘虏臧荼。

下诏各侯王推举有功之臣立为新燕王。

楚王韩信等十人都说：“太尉长安侯卢绾功劳最多，请立他为燕王。”

派丞相樊哙领兵平定代地。

利几叛变，高祖亲自领兵将他消灭。

利几，原是项羽的部将。

项羽兵败时，利几为陈县令，降汉后，皇上封他为颍川侯。

皇上到洛阳，对有通侯籍爵的进行召见，而利几自恐曾是项羽部将，就叛变了。

闰九月，征选诸侯子弟到关中。

兴建长乐宫。

高祖六年冬十月，命令天下各县邑筑城。

有人告密说楚王韩信要谋反，皇上征求左右的意见，左右都主张出兵征讨。

高祖采纳陈平的计谋，假称游猎于云梦。

十二月，在陈地召开各侯王会议，楚王韩信前往迎见，就乘机将他拘执。

下诏说：“天下已经安定，豪杰有功的封为侯爵，新即帝位，还没能全部按功行赏。

由于身在军中九年，有的无暇学习法令，有的误犯国法，严重的要判处死刑，我为之深表同情。

现在打算大赦天下。”

田肯表示祝贺说：“皇上所见极是。陛下拘执了韩信，又建都于关中。

秦，是形势胜便之地，以黄河为带，关山为险，和东部诸侯相隔千里，秦地以二万之众，可敌外来百万之兵。

秦地形势便利，当它要挥师出关征伐不臣，为此高屋建瓴势如破竹。

至于齐地东边有琅笽、即墨的富饶，南边有泰山的险固，西有黄河以为天堑，北有渤海可利防卫，面积周围达二千里，且悬隔于千里海隅，能以二十万之众，阻击百万之兵。这等于是东西二秦。

不是至亲子弟，不能派去为齐王。”

高祖说：“此言极当。”

赐黄金五百斤。

高祖回到洛阳，赦免韩信，降为淮阴侯。

十二月二十八日，开始剖符封功臣曹参等为通侯。

下诏说：“齐，是自古建国之地，现在改为郡县，应恢复为封国以封侯王。

将军刘贾屡建大功，可以推举像他这样的功德兼具的人为齐、荆等地之王。”

汉高祖七年春正月二十一日，韩王信等上奏，请以原东阳郡、鄣郡、吴郡五十三县立刘贾为荆王。

以砀郡、薛郡、郯郡三十六县立皇上之弟文信侯刘交为楚王。

二十七日，以云中、雁门、代郡五十三县立皇上之兄宜信侯刘喜为代王。

以胶东、胶西、临淄、济北、博阳、城阳郡七十三县立皇子肥为齐王。

以太原郡三十一县为韩国，迁徒韩王信都于晋阳。

汉高祖已经大封功臣二十余人，其余的争功，使封赏工作未能正常进行。

皇上住在南宫，从复道上见诸将常常三三两两地私语，就问张良是何原因。

张良说：“陛下和他们共取天下，今皇上已为天子，而所封赏的都是原来的友好与亲属，而所诛杀的都是昔日的仇怨。

今日军吏计功，认为天下土地少而功臣多，不能遍封，而诸将恐被皇上抓住过失而遭诛杀，就互相串通准备谋反了。”

高祖忧虑地说：“怎么办啊？”

张良说：“找一个皇上平日最憎恶的，也是群臣都知道皇上最恨的一个人，先封赏他以安定众心。”

三月，皇上举行宴会，封赏了昔日的仇人雍齿，并催丞相迅速定功行封。

宴会之后，群臣都很高兴，他们说：“雍齿尚且能封侯，我们还担忧什么！”

皇上驾还栎阳，每五日朝见太公一次。

太公的家臣对太公说：“天无二日，地无二王。

皇帝虽是您的儿子，却是天子；您虽是皇帝的父亲，却是人臣。

怎能叫人主拜人臣！长此下去，皇帝的威权就难以树立。”

以后高祖来朝，太公亲自打扫台阶以示敬，并当着门后退。

皇上大惊，下辇扶太公。

太公说：“皇帝，万民之主，不要因为我而乱君臣之法！”

于是皇上认为太公的这位家臣善于处理父子君臣的关系，就赏赐黄金五百斤。

夏五月二十三日，下诏说：人间至亲，莫亲于父子，所以父有天下传归于子，子有天下其尊荣归之于父。这是人伦的普遍道理。

昔日天下大乱，战祸四起，万民苦殃，朕亲自身披甲胄，手持兵器，带领士卒，冲锋陷阵，平定暴乱，建立诸侯，偃兵息民天下大安，这都归功于太公的教诲有方。

各王、通侯、将军、郡卿、大夫都已经尊朕为皇帝，而太公尚未有号。今日上尊太公为太上皇。”

秋九月，匈奴围困韩王信于马邑，信降于匈奴。

高祖七年冬十月，皇上亲自领兵到铜鞮县攻打投降于匈奴的韩王信，杀其主将。

信逃亡到匈奴去，韩王信的部将曼丘臣、王黄共同立故赵之后赵利为王，收集韩王信的散兵，与匈奴联合抗击汉兵。

皇上从晋阳连续作战，乘胜追击，到达楼烦。适逢严寒，士卒被冻坏手指的占十分之二三。

只得退到平城，遭到匈奴围困。七日之后，用陈平所献的美人计得以突围。

派樊哙留守以安定代地。

十二月，皇上回朝时经过赵地，对赵王未给礼遇。

同月，匈奴攻代，代王喜弃城而逃，自归洛阳，赦免其罪，降为令阳侯。

二十一日皇上立子如意为代王。

高祖八年春，诏令郎中凡犯有应罚以颊鬓以上罪行的，要请示上级复核。

民家生了子女，可免去徭役二年。

八年二月，皇上到长安。

萧何负责修建未央宫，建立东阙、北阙、前殿、武库、大仓。

皇上见其十分壮丽，甚为恼怒，对萧何说：“天下扰攘，人民长期困苦，成败尚未可知，为何修建如此壮丽的宫殿！”

萧何说：“正是因为天下还未完全平定，就抓紧修建宫室。

而天子是代表全国的的尊严与权力，宫室不壮丽就不能显示其权威。同时还昭示后世不必再行扩建了。”

皇上很高兴。

就从栎阳迁都于长安。

设立宗正官以序九族。

夏四月，巡行到洛阳。

八年冬，皇上东击韩信的余党于东垣。

兵还时经过赵地，赵相贯高等对于去年冬高祖过赵时不礼于赵王事衔耻含恨，就阴谋杀死皇上。

皇上正打算在赵地住宿，心跳不已，问人说：“此县名什么？”人答说：“名柏人。”

皇上说：“柏人，是受人迫之意。”离此而去。

十一月，下诏：对于从军死亡的士卒用小棺盛其遗体，送回原籍，由原籍县供应葬衣葬具，用羊牲进行祭祀，县令亲自参加葬礼。

十二月，皇上从东垣回到京都。

高祖九年春三月，巡行到洛阳。

下诏：对于参加过坚守平城及其左右城邑的吏卒，一律免除其终身徭役。

爵级不达到公乘(汉第八级)以上的不得戴刘氏冠——竹皮冠。

商人不允许穿着细绫细葛与纟宁布毛衣，不允许手持兵器，不允许单骑驾车。

秋八月宣布吏过去有罪尚未被告发觉的，予以宽赦。

九月，从洛阳返回京都。

陪驾回朝的有淮南王、梁王、赵王、楚王等。

九年冬十月，淮南王、梁王、赵王、楚王朝拜皇上于未央宫。

在前殿摆设酒筵。皇上捧玉杯为太上皇敬酒祝寿，皇上说：“儿年轻时父亲总以为儿没有出息，不能兴家创业，不如二弟勤苦。

今日儿所创的基业与二哥相比以谁为多？”

殿上群臣都欢呼皇上万岁，笑声不断以增添皇上与太上皇的欢乐。

十一月，迁移齐、楚的大姓昭氏、屈氏、景氏、怀氏、田氏五姓到关中，分给较好的土地与房屋。

十二月，驾到洛阳。

赵相贯高等暗杀阴谋被揭露，就将其全部逮捕，同时还逮捕了赵王敖入狱。

诏令说谁敢和赵王发生联系，就灭谁的三族。

赵郎中田叔、孟舒等十人自己披枷戴锁作为赵王家奴，随同赵王入狱。

赵王确实不知暗杀皇上的阴谋。

高祖十年春正月，废赵王敖为宣平侯。

迁代主如意为赵王，统辖赵地。

正月二十八，宣布诏书，以前的罪犯除死刑外，一律赦免。

二月，从洛阳回京都。

皇上佩服赵臣田叔、孟舒等十人的操行，召见并进行谈话，发现他们的才识超过朝廷大臣。

皇上十分欣赏，都封为郡守与诸侯相。

夏六月三十日，日食。

十年冬十月，淮南王、燕王、荆王、梁王、楚王、齐、长沙王来朝。

十一年夏五月，太上皇后去世。

秋七月十四日，太上皇驾崩，葬于万年。

墓区栎阳县的囚犯除死罪外予以赦免。

八月，诏令各地侯王在都邑建立太上皇庙。

九月，代地相国陈豨反。

皇上说：“陈豨曾执行我使命，甚有信用。

代地是我很重视的地方，所以封他为列侯，以相国身份镇守代地。不意今日竟与王黄等作乱于此地！

该地的吏民是无罪的，凡属能与豨、黄决裂而来归顺的，都予赦免。”

皇上亲自东征，兵至邯郸。

皇上高兴地说：“陈豨不南据邯郸而凭漳水自守，我看他是没有什么能耐的。”

赵相国周昌奏常山郡有二十五城被陈豨占领了二十城，请求诛戮常山郡守郡尉。

皇上说：“守、尉参加了反叛吗？”答道：“没有。”

皇上说：“这是他们兵力不足，无罪。”

皇上命令周昌选派赵地壮土可以任将领的，周昌引见四人。

皇上谩骂道：“小子们能当将领吗？”

四人惭愧，都伏地叩首。

皇上将四人封为千户，命他们为将。

左右劝止说：“从进入蜀汉，攻伐楚项，赏赐都还没有完全实行，今日却一下子封他们为千户，他们有什么功？”

皇上说：“这不是你们所知道的。

陈豨反叛，赵、代二地都被他占据。

我以紧急军令征集天下兵马，至今还没有人到，现在所依靠的就是邯郸的士卒了。

我为何舍不得这四个千户的官职，而不给赵地子弟以激励呢？”

大家都说：“对。”

皇上又问：“燕国名将乐毅有后吗？”找到了他的孙子乐叔，封之于乐乡，号称华成君。

问陈豨的部将情况，都是过去一些商贾人。

皇上说：“我知道采取什么办法来对付他们了。”

于是多出金币收买豨的部将，豨将大多降顺。

十一年冬，皇上在邯郸。

陈豨部将侯敞率士卒一万余人检阅示威，王黄率骑军千余骑驻军于曲逆。叛将张春领兵一万余人渡黄河进攻聊城。

汉将军郭蒙与齐将会兵进攻，大破叛军。

太尉周勃取道太原进入代地，兵到马邑，马邑不降，周勃强攻攻下马邑。

陈豨部将赵利据守车垣，高祖未能攻下。

叛兵大骂皇上，皇上怒。

攻克后，对于骂皇上的叛兵予以斩首示众。

各县坚守不降叛军的，免除三年的租赋。

十二年春正月，淮阴侯韩信在长安谋反，被诛灭三族。

将军柴武斩韩王信于参合。

皇上返回洛阳。

下诏说：“代地在常山之北，与夷狄相邻，赵地则在常山之南，离夷狄较远，代地多次有胡寇入侵，难于防守。

现在划割山南太原之地一部分属于代，代的云中以西为云中郡，这样代地受到边寇入侵就较少了。

在王、相国、通侯、吏二千石中选择可以立为代王的人。”

燕王卢绾、丞相萧何等三十三人齐奏：“皇子刘恒贤智温良，请立以为代王，都于晋阳。”

随后下诏大赦天下。

二月，皇上下诏说：“朕深欲减省赋敛。

今上交国库没有统一的章程，地方官常多取赋敛以上交，而各地侯王则赋敛更多，百姓甚为困苦。

现在通知各侯王、通侯每逢十月为上交赋敛期，至于各地计算的方式是以人口数为准，每人每年上缴六十三钱，以交国库。”

诏书又说：“常闻王者没有超过周文王的，霸者没有超过齐桓公的，都是依靠贤人辅佐而成名的。

当今天下的贤才智能之人难道不及古代的多吗？

只怕人主不尊重人才，人才就无从发现与发挥作用！

今日我仰仗上天的威灵依靠贤士大夫的支持而取得天下，成为刘汉一统，想长久传业，代代奉宗庙而不要亡绝。

各位贤才曾帮助我共定天下，却不能和我共享荣华，行吗？

贤士大夫有肯跟我共事的，我一定能让他们显贵。

把这个意思布告天下，使大家都明白朕的心意。

御史大夫周昌把诏书下达给相国，相国酂侯萧何下达给诸侯王，御史中执法下达给郡守，那些有美名和美德相称的人，一定要亲自去劝勉，为他们准备车马，送到相国府，登记他们的品行、仪表和年龄。

有这样的人却不举荐，一旦发现，就免除官职。

年老体弱有病的，就不要送来。”

三月，梁王彭越谋反，被诛灭三族。

下诏说：“选择可以为梁王、淮阳王的人。”

燕王卢绾、相国萧何请立皇子恢为梁王，皇子友为淮阳王。

废置东郡，一部分划入梁地；废置颍川郡，一部分划入淮阳。

夏四月，从洛阳回到京都。

下令原丰县人迁入关中的都免除徭役终身。

五月，下诏说：“粤人的习俗，好互相斗殴，前时秦朝迁徙中原百姓以充实桂林、象郡、南海三郡，让其与百粤杂处。

后逢天下诛秦，南海尉赵佗在此长期治理，很有章法，中原迁来的人没有受到损害，粤人互相斗殴之风大息，这都是靠赵佗的治理有方。

今立赵佗为南粤王。”

派陆贾送给赵佗印绶。

赵佗叩首称臣。

六月，诏令凡是士卒从高祖进入蜀、汉、关中的一律免除劳役终身。

秋七月，淮南王英布反。

皇上问计于诸将，滕公说原楚令尹薛公早有妙计。

皇上立即召见，薛公分析了英布的形势，皇上甚为满意，加封薛公千户。

诏令王、相国选择可立为淮南王的人，群臣请立皇子长为王。

皇上于是征调上郡、北地、陇西车骑、巴蜀勇士及御林军三万人为皇太子的护卫，驻军于霸上。

英布果不出薛公所料，东击杀荆王刘贾，迫降荆王之兵，渡过淮水攻楚，楚王刘交退避到薛。

皇上赦天下死罪以下的囚犯，都加入军队；同时征调诸侯之兵，御驾亲征英布。

十二年冬十月，皇上打败英布之兵于会缶。

英布逃走，皇上派别将追逐。

皇上回都，经过故乡沛县，暂作停留，在沛宫摆开筵席，招待所有的故人父老子弟饮酒。

召集沛中儿郎一百二十人，教他们唱歌。

酒兴正浓时，皇上击打乐器，自唱道：“大风激猛啊云飞扬/威加四海啊归故乡/安得猛士啊守四方！”

令儿郎们都一起和唱。

皇上随歌起舞，慷慨感伤，泪水下淌。

对沛地父兄说：“游子总是怀念自己的故乡。

我虽身居关中，逝世以后，魂魄仍然会留恋沛地家乡的。

回想朕从任沛公起兵以推翻暴秦，遂得天下，愿以沛为朕的汤沐邑，免除沛民徭役，世世代代不向朝廷缴纳赋税。”

沛县父老故人连日共饮极欢并讲述皇上昔日故事为笑乐。

十余日，皇上想辞去，沛地父兄坚决留客。

皇上说：“我的随从甚多，父兄供给不了。”就离开了。

沛中万人空巷送皇上到县西并献上告别的礼品。

皇上又停留下来，张开帐幕宴请送行的人三天。

沛县父老子弟都叩首感戴说：“沛县叨蒙皇恩免除赋役，而丰县却未能得恩，望皇上对丰县予以关怀。”

皇上说：“丰县，是我生长的地方，我是至念不忘的。

我只因为雍齿曾在这里反我而归魏，就不想照顾了。”

沛父兄再三请求，皇上同意免除丰县赋役，和沛一样。

汉别将击英布残部于洮水南北，将叛军全歼，追斩英布于番阳。

周勃平定代地，斩陈豨于当城。

皇上下诏说：“吴，是古代之国。

往日荆王兼有其地，今日荆王已死无后。

朕想重立吴地之王。请推议可任之人。”

长沙王臣等上言：“沛侯刘濞老成持重，请立为吴王。”

已经加封，皇上召见刘濞说：“你的形状有反叛之相。”

就以手抚其背，说：“汉后五十年东南有乱，难道应在你的身上吗？

但现在是刘汉同姓一家，你切不可反叛。”

刘濞惶恐叩首说：“不敢。”

十一月，从淮南回京都。

途经鲁地，用全牛祭祀孔子。

十二月，下诏说：“秦皇帝、楚隐王(陈胜)、魏安僖王、齐闵王、赵悼襄王，都绝嗣无后。

现定制为秦始皇守墓二十家，为楚、魏、齐王守墓各十家，为赵及魏信陵君守墓各五家，其任务是管理守卫坟墓，免除其他赋役。”

陈豨降将告密说陈豨反时，燕王卢绾曾派人到陈豨处参与阴谋。

皇上派辟阳侯审食其去请绾回都，卢绾说有病不能前来。

食其对皇上说卢绾有参加谋反的可能。

次年春二月，派樊哙、周勃领兵讨伐卢绾。

皇上发布文告说：“燕王绾与我关系很深，我爱如子弟，听说他与陈豨有勾结，我以为不实，就派人请他至京都一叙。

卢绾称病不来，他参与陈豨的阴谋就昭然若揭了。

燕地的吏民是无罪的，赏赐燕吏在六百石以上的各晋爵一级。

和卢绾有联系，现在能弃暗投明的，都免予追究，亦加爵一级。”

还诏令各侯王议举可立为燕王之人。

长沙王臣等请立皇子建为燕王。

高帝颁布诏书说：“南武侯织，也是南越的贵族世家，立为南海王。”

三月，皇上下诏说：“我即位为天子，称皇帝于天下，已经十二年了。

与天下的英豪贤大夫共同平定天下，共同治理天下。

对有功之臣上等封为王，二等封为列侯，下等特赐食邑。

而对功臣的亲属，有的封为列侯，并允许自设官吏，自取赋敛，其女子亦有汤沐邑。

凡为列侯拥有食邑的，都佩有印绶，赏赐大宅。

官吏二千石的，都乔迁到长安，按爵级赏赐房屋。

曾经随我入蜀汉定三秦的将士，都代代免除赋役。

我对于天下的贤士功臣，可算是没有亏待了。

要是有忘恩负义之徒背叛天子拥兵叛逆者，我将发动天下臣民共同诛讨。

特布告天下，让大家明白朕的意思。”

皇上攻打英布时，被流矢射中，在征途中就病了。

病情逐渐加重。吕后请来良医。

医生入见，皇上问对伤势的看法。

医生说：“病会好起来。”

此时皇上对医生嬉笑怒骂，他说：“我以平民提三尺宝剑以取天下，这不是天命吗？

命之在天，就是神医扁鹊重生对我又有何益！”

就不让医生诊病，赏赐黄金五十斤，叫他出宫。

吕后问道：“陛下百年之后，萧何丞相也去世，谁能代他为相？”

皇上说：“曹参可以。”

吕后又问谁继曹参，皇上说：“王陵可，然他性格有些刚直，陈平可以帮助他。

陈平智谋有余，但难单独任丞相。

周勃老成持重而不善于文辞，可是安定刘汉的一定是周勃，可以令他任太尉之职。”

吕后又问再以后谁继以大任，皇上说：“再以后我也说不清楚了。”

卢绾与数千人居于边塞等待，希望皇上病愈，就入朝谢罪辨诬。

夏四月二十五日，高帝驾崩于长乐宫。

卢绾闻讯后，就逃到匈奴去了。

吕后对审食其说：“不少将领与皇上在过去都同登平民册籍，后来他们北面称臣，心里总不满足，现在要再争少主，如不将他们诛灭，天下不安。”

于是不发布皇帝去世的讣告。

有人闻皇上死讯，就告诉了郦商。

郦商见审食其说：“听说皇帝已去世，四日仍不发丧，想诛杀诸侯。

果真如此，天下就危险了。

陈平、灌婴领十万重兵守荥阳，樊哙、周勃领二十万重兵镇燕、代，他们要是听到皇上已崩，要诛诸将，将会联兵向京都进发，夺取关中。

大臣内叛，诸将外反，败亡就是旦夕间事了。”

审食其将此言转呈吕后，吕后就在四月二十八日发丧，宣布大赦天下。

五月十七日，葬皇帝于长陵。

已下棺，皇太子群臣都回到太上皇庙。

君臣说：“皇帝崛起于平民，力挽狂澜还于正道，平定天下，成为汉朝开国祖先，功劳最高。”

上尊号名为高皇帝。

原先，高祖不大注意书本知识，而秉性开朗聪明，善于思考，能博采众议，从人民及官吏到普通士卒，都能平易相亲。

入关之初顺民心作约法三章。

天下平定之后，命萧何整理法律与条令，命韩信建立与健全军队法纪，命张苍统一历法与度量衡等法式，令叔孙通制定各种礼节与仪式，令陆贾作总结历史兴亡之鉴的《新语》。

又与各功臣剖符作誓，丹书铁契，贮于金柜石室之中，保藏于宗庙之内。

高祖虽然日理万机，但订立的规划与矩度是意义深远的。

班固评论：《春秋》晋国史官蔡墨说过：唐尧所建的陶唐氏衰微了，其后有刘累，学驯龙之术，臣事于夏天子孔甲，晋国范氏是他的后代。

而晋大夫范宣子亦说过：“我的祖先从虞以上为陶唐民，在夏代为御龙氏，在商代为豕韦氏，在周为唐杜氏，在晋为霸主时为范氏。”

范氏为晋正卿，鲁文公时出奔秦国。

后归于晋，其留居秦地的为刘氏。

刘向说成国时刘氏从秦复居于魏。

秦攻魏，魏都迁徙于大梁，都于丰地，所以周市劝说雍齿说：“丰，是魏的迁徙之处。”

据此以赞颂汉高祖说：“汉帝的本系，出自于陶唐尧帝。传世到周，在秦姓刘。经魏而向东，于是为丰公。”

丰公，可能是太上皇之父。

其迁丰之日不久，坟墓在丰地的不多。

到高祖即位，设置祠祀之官，于是有秦、晋、梁、荆的祖庙，世世祠祭天地祖先香火连绵，这是有根源的啊！

以此推断，汉承尧运，德行气数正逢盛时，断蛇而合“白帝子为赤帝子所杀”的谶言，旗帜以红色为主，这是火德的象征，以火代木的自然感应，正符合上天统序的规律。</div>

          <div class="txt">In the fifth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the King of Han pursued Hsiang Yü to [a place] south of Yang-chia. [There] he stopped and encamped. He had arranged for a meeting with the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, and with the Chancellor of State in Weih, [P'eng] Yüeh, to attack Ch'u.

[but even] when he reached Ku-ling, they did not meet him.

[The army of] Ch'u attacked the army of Hans and severely routed it. [So] the King of Han again went into entrenchments, digging deep his moat, and held himself on the defensive.

He said to Chang Liang, "The nobles do not follow [me], what can I do?"

[Chang] Liang replied, "Altho the troops of Ch'u are almost routed, you have not yet distributed to [your followers] any territory; it is really quite natural that they did not come.

If your Majesty is able to share the world with them, you can get them to come immediately.

The establishment of [Han] Hsin as King of Ch'i was not your Majesty's design; [Han] Hsin is moreover not yet sure of his position.

P'eng Yüeh originally subjugated the region of Liang; at first your Majesty installed [P'eng] Yüeh as Chancellor of State on account of Wei Pao.

now [Wei] Pao is dead and [P'eng] Yüeh hopes to be king, but your Majesty did not decide [to appoint him] in good time.

If now you will take [the region] north of Sui-yang to Ku-ch'eng and make P'eng Yüeh king of it all, and give the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, [the region] from the east of Ch'en to the ocean—[Han] Hsin's home is in Ch'u; he wants to obtain again his home town.

if you can give up these territories and promise them to these two men, making each one fight for his own [interests], then Ch'u will easily be defeated."

Thereupon the King of Han dispatched a messenger to cause Han Hsin and P'eng Yüeh to come.

Both came, leading their troops.

In the eleventh month, Liu Chia entered the region of Ch'u and besieged Shou-ch'un.

Hans also sent someone to tempt the Commander-in-chief of Ch'u, Chou Yin.

[Chou] Yin rebelled against Ch'u; with [forces from] Shu, he [captured and] massacred [the inhabitants of] Liu, raised the troops of [the kingdom of] Chiu-chiang, and welcomed [back] Ch'ing Pu; they marched together and massacred [the inhabitants of] Ch'eng-fu. In the train of Liu Chia they all joined forces.

In the twelfth month they surrounded [Hsiang] Yü's [camp] at Kai-hsia.

In the night [Hsiang] Yü heard the army of Hans on all sides singing the songs of Ch'u, and thought that [the King of Han] had gained all the territory of Ch'u.

[so Hsiang] Yü fled with several hundred horsemen. Because of this fact, his army was severely defeated.

Kuan Ying pursued and beheaded [Hsiang] Yü at Tung-ch'eng.

[Thereafter] the territory of Ch'u was all subjugated, only [the state of] Lu would not submit.

The King of Han led the troops of the empire [against it], intending to massacre its [inhabitants]. Because it was a state which had guarded itself faithfully and was [known for its] proper conduct and sense of human relationships, [the King of Han had] the head of [Hsiang] Yü held up and shown to the elders [of Lu]; then Lu surrendered.

Because King Huai had originally appointed [Hsiang] Yü as the Duke of Lu, and because when he died Lu was still firmly defended for him, [the King of Han had Hsiang] Yü therefore buried at Ku-ch'eng [with the title of] a Duke of Lu.

The King of Han proclaimed a mourning ceremony for him. He wept and lamented, then left.

He appointed Hsiang Po and others, [altogether] four [of Hsiang Yü's kindred], as marquises, granting them the [imperial] surname, Liu.

All the people who had been captured [and kept] in Ch'u were [allowed] to return [home].

The King of Han returned to Ting-t'ao, rode into the entrenchments of the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, and took away his army.

The King of Lin-chiang, Kung Ao, whom Hsiang Yü had originally set up, had previously died; his son [Kung] Wei had been set up [by Hsiang Yü] in succession as king, [so] he did not surrender.

[The King of Han] sent Lu Wan and Liu Chia to attack him; they captured [Kung] Wei.

In the spring, the first month, [the King of Han] posthumously honored his older brother [Liu] Po, entitling him Marquis Wu-ai.

An order was given, saying, "The region of Ch'u has already been subjugated, [but] the Emperor Yi had no heirs; We wish to be solicitous for the people of Ch'u and fix upon a king for them.

The King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, is well versed in the customs of Ch'u—let [his kingdom] be changed and [let] him be established as the King of Ch'u, ruling over [the region] north of the Huai [River], with his capital at Hsia-p'ei.

The Chancellor of State at Weih, the Chien-ch'eng Marquis, P'eng Yüeh, has toiled diligently for the people of Weih; he has humbled and abased himself to his soldiers and officers. Often with a few [followers] he has attacked a more numerous [force]; several times he has routed the army of Ch'u. Let him be made king over the former territory of Weih, with the title, `The King of Liang.' His capital shall be at Ting-t'ao."

[The order] also said, "The troops have not had rest for eight years. All the people have suffered severely. Now [my efforts in settling the control] of the world have been brought to completion. Let an amnesty [be proclaimed] throughout the world [for all crimes] below [those deserving] capital punishment."

Thereupon the nobles sent up a petition to [the King of Han], saying: "The King of Ch'u, Han Hsin, the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, the King of Huai-nan, Ying Pu, the King of Liang, P'eng Yüeh, the former King of Heng-shan, Wu Jui, the King of Chao, Chang Ao, and the King of Yen, Tsang Tu, risking death and making repeated obeisances, say to your Majesty the great King:

In times past the Ch'in [dynasty] acted contrary to principle and the world punished it.

You, great King, were the first to capture the King of Ch'in and subjugate Kuan-chung—your achievements have been the greatest in the world.

You have preserved the perishing and given repose to those in danger; you have rescued those who were ruined and have continued broken [lines of descent] in order to tranquillize all the people. Your achievements are abundant and your virtue is great.

You have moreover granted favors to the vassal kings who have merit, enabling them to succeed in setting up their gods of the soil and grains.

The division of the land has already been settled, but positions and titles are [still] confounded with one another, without the [proper] division of the superior [from] the inferior, so that the manifestation of your, the great King's, merits and virtue is not proclaimed to later generations.

Risking death and making repeated obeisances, we offer to our superior the honorable title of Emperor."

The King of Hans replied, "I, a person of little virtue, have heard that [the title of] emperor should be possessed by a man eminent in talent and virtue. An empty name without [possessing] its reality should not be adopted.

Now you, vassal kings, have all highly exalted me, a person of little virtue. How could I therefore occupy [such a position]?"

The vassal kings all said, "You, great King, arose from small [beginnings]; you destroyed the seditious [dynasty of] Ch'in; your majesty stirs everything within the seas.

Moreover, starting from a secluded and mean region, from Han-chung, you acted out your majesty and virtue, executing the unrighteous, setting up the meritorious, tranquillizing and establishing the empire. Meritorious officials all received territory and the income of towns; you did not appropriate them for yourself.

Your virtue, great King, has been bestowed [even to the borders of] the four seas. We, vassal kings, [find our speech] inadequate to express it. For you to take the position of Emperor would be most appropriate. We hope that you, great King, will favor the world [by doing so]."

The King of Han replied, "Since the vassal kings would be favored [by it] and since they consider it to be an advantage to [all] the people in the world, it may be done."

Thereupon the vassal kings and "your servant, the Grand Commandant and Marquis of Ch'ang-an, [Lu] Wan, and others, [altogether] three hundred persons, together with the Erudit and the Chi-szu Baronet, Shu-sun T'ung, carefully selected a favorable day." In the second month, on [the day] chia-wu, they presented to their superior the honorable title [of Emperor].

and the King of Han ascended the imperial throne upon the northern bank of the river Szu.

The Queen was honored and called, "The Empress"; the Heir-apparent was called "The Imperial Heir-apparent"; the deceased old dame, [the Emperor's mother], was posthumously honored and called "The Chao-ling Lady."

An imperial edict read: "The former King of Heng-shan, Wu Jui, together with his two sons and his older brother's son, followed by the troops of the many Yüeh, rendered very signal service in assisting the nobles in punishing the tyrannous Ch'in [dynasty]; the nobles set him up as King.

[but] Hsiang Yü took away his territory by force, calling him [merely] the Baronet of P'o.

Let the Baronet of P'o, [Wu] Jui, be established as King of Ch'ang-sha, [ruling over] Ch'ang-sha, Yü-chang, the Hsiang Commandery, Kuei-lin, and Nan-hai."

It also said, "The ex-king of [Min-] Yüeh, [Tsou] Wu-chu, for a generation has been perpetuating the ancestral sacrifices of Yüeh; the Ch'in [dynasty] took away his territory by force, [so that] his gods of the soils and grains did not get any blood or food.

When the nobles were chastizing the Ch'in [dynasty, Tsou] Wu-chu himself led the troops of Min-chung to assist in destroying the Ch'in [dynasty]; [but] Hsiang Yü set him aside and did not set him up [as king].

Now we make him King of Min-yüeh, ruling over the territory of Min-chung. Let them not neglect their charges."

The Emperor thereupon went west and established his capital at Lo-yang.

In the summer, the fifth month, the troops were all disbanded and returned to their homes.

An imperial edict said, "The members of the noble families in Kuan-chung are exempted [from service and taxes] for twelve years; those who have already returned [home are exempted for] half [that period].

As to the people who formerly had collected to take refuge in the mountains and marshes, whose names and numbers have not been enregistered—the world has now been pacified, [hence] We order that each return to his prefecture and resume his former noble rank, his fields, and his habitation. The officials, using civil laws, should teach and instruct [these people]; let it be published abroad that there is to be no beating nor shaming [of them].

As to those people who because of famine or hunger have themselves sold their persons to be slaves or slave-girls, let them all be freed and become common people.

As to the officers and soldiers in the army who have been pardoned, those who have been without crime, but are without any noble rank, and those who have not attained [the rank of] Grandee, We grant them all the noble rank of Grandee.

To all those who formerly [had the rank] of Grandee and upward, We grant a noble rank one step [higher].

Let it be ordered that all those who have [the noble rank of] Seventh [Rank] Grandee and upward are to be given the revenue of estates; all those below [the noble rank of] Seventh [Rank] Grandee will themselves be personally exempted [from public service] and their households will not be required to do public service."

It also said, "[The noble ranks] of Seventh [Rank] Grandee and Public Chariot and above are all high ranks.

Among the members of the noble houses and those who have returned from the army are very many with high noble ranks; I have several times ordered the officials to give fields and habitations to them first, and that whatever they rightfully ask of the officials should be promptly given them.

There are some people with [high] noble titles as lords of men whom the Emperor has honored, performed the ceremonies, and set up a long time ago, [but] about whom the officials have unexpectedly not yet reached a decision—this is utterly unspeakable.

As to those among the people of Ch'in who in former days were ennobled [with the ranks] of Universal Grandee and upwards, a Chief and an Assistant should respect them as their equals.

Now I do not think lightly of [these] noble ranks, why should the officials alone take them thus?

Moreover, according to the law, those who have some achievement and have rendered meritorious service should be given fields and habitations; [yet] at present many of the small officials who have never been with the army have been satisfied, but those who have [military] merit have nevertheless received nothing. For a [Commandery] Administrator, a [Commandery] Commandant, or a Chief Official to act contrary to public interest and for the interests of private persons is a kind of teaching and instruction that is extremely bad.

Let it be ordered that the officials should treat the holders of high noble ranks properly [in order to] conform to my wishes.

Moreover there will be an inspection and examination; if there are [found] any who have not acted in accordance with my edict, they will be heavily sentenced."

The Emperor held a feast in the Southern Palace at Lo-yang.

The Emperor said, "Marquises and generals, do not dare to hide anything from Us. Express all your feelings.

What was the reason that I have obtained the empire? What was the reason that the house of Hsiang [Yü] lost the empire?"

Kao Ch'i and Wang Ling replied, "Your Majesty treats people cavalierly and is rude to them, [whereas] Hsiang Yü was kind and respected people.

yet when your Majesty sent people to attack a city or overrun a region, you thereupon gave them whatever they submitted, sharing your advantages with the world.

Hsiang Yü was jealous of the capable and envious of the able; he [sought to] injure whoever had accomplished anything worth while and was suspicious of those who were capable. When people were victorious in battle he did not give them any glory; when they obtained some territory, he did not give others any advantage [of it]. The foregoing is the reason that he lost the empire."

The Emperor said, "You sirs, know a part, but you do not know the whole.

Now, in revolving plans in the tent and in making a victory certain at a distance of a thousand li, I am not as good as [Chang] Tzu-fang.

In pacifying a state, in soothing the people, in supplying pay and provisions and never permitting the communications for food to be cut, I am not as good as Hsiao Ho.

In uniting a crowd of a million [men], in being sure of victory in battle, and in taking whatever [place] one attacks, I am not as good as Han Hsin.

[These] three are all outstanding men. I was able to make use of them— that is the reason I took the world.

Hsiang Yü had one Fan Tseng, but he could not make use of him—that was the reason he became my captive."

The crowd of officials were glad to acquiesce.

Originally T'ien Heng had gone over to P'eng Yüeh.

When Hsiang Yü had already been destroyed, [T'ien] Heng was afraid of being executed, [so] with his clients and guests he fled into the sea.

The Emperor was afraid that if he stayed long he would create trouble, [so] sent a messenger to grant [T'ien] Heng amnesty, saying, "If [T'ien] Heng [and his party] come [and surrender], the great [person in his company will be made] a king and the lesser [persons] marquises. If [he and his following] do not come, I will immediately send out troops and punish [him and his followers] with death."

[T'ien] Heng was dismayed, [so], riding a [four-horse] post-carriage, he went to Lo-yang. When he was [still] thirty li away, he committed suicide.

The Emperor admired his faithfulness and wept for him. He sent out two thousand soldiers to bury him with the rites of a king.

A banished man, Lou Ching, begged for an interview and said to the Emperor, "Your Majesty has taken the empire differently from [the way the] Chou [dynasty did], [so that] your capital in Lo-yang is not advantageous. It is better to enter the passes and occupy the stronghold of the Ch'in [dynasty]."

The Emperor asked Chang Liang about it. [Chang] Liang therefore urged the Emperor [likewise].

On that day [the Emperor] mounted the imperial chariot and went westwards to fix his capital at Ch'ang-an.

He installed Lou Ching as the Feng-ch'un Baronet and granted him the [imperial] surname, Liu.

In the sixth month, on the day jen-ch'en, a general amnesty for the world [was proclaimed].

In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of Yen, Tsang Tu, revolted. The Emperor, himself [acting as] general, marched against him.

In the ninth month he captured [Tsang] Tu.

An imperial edict [ordered] the vassal kings to look for a meritorious person to be made king of Yen.

"The King of Ching, your servant, [Han] Hsin," and others, ten [in all], all replied, "The merits of the Grand Commandant and Marquis of Ch'ang-an, Lu Wan, are the greatest [of all]. We beg you to make him King of Yen."

[The Emperor] sent his Lieutenant Chancellor [Fan] K'uai with troops to subjugate the region of Tai.

Li Chi rebelled; the Emperor personally [led the army to] attack him and routed his [army].

Li Chi had been a general of Hsiang Yü.

when [Hsiang] Yü was defeated, Li Chi was the magistrate of Ch'en. He had submitted [to Kao-tsu] and the Emperor had made him a Marquis in the Ying-ch'uan [Commandery].

When the Emperor had arrived at Lo-yang, he had summoned the whole of the marquises that were enregistered, hence Li Chi had been afraid and had rebelled.

In the intercalary ninth month, [the Emperor] removed the members of noble families to Kuan-chung.

He repaired the Ch'ang-lo Palace.

In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the Emperor ordered the prefectural cities and towns of the empire to build themselves city walls.

A man gave information that the King of Ch'u, [Han] Hsin, was planning to revolt. The Emperor asked those around him [about it]; those around him vied [with each other], wanting to attack [Han Hsin.

But the Emperor] utilized the stratagem [suggested by] Ch'en P'ing. So he feigned to make a trip to Yün-meng.

In the twelfth month he assembled the nobles at Ch'en, and the King of Ch'u, [Han] Hsin, went to pay his respects. Thereupon [the Emperor] arrested him.

An imperial edict read, "Since the world has been at peace, eminent and distinguished persons who have merit have been appointed marquises. I am but newly seated [on the throne, hence] have not been able to plan a complete [reward for] their meritorious actions.

They themselves have lived with the army for nine years, [so that] whether because they are not yet accustomed to the laws and ordinances, or because they formerly violated the law, [those who have committed] great [crimes] have been killed or mutilated. I pity them greatly.

Let there be an amnesty granted to all the world."

T'ien K'en congratulated the Emperor, saying, "[Your Majesty's plans are] very good. Your Majesty has taken Han Hsin and also rules from [the region of] Ch'in.

Ch'in is a country with an excellent geographical situation. It is girdled by the [Yellow] River, with mountains as barriers, separated [from the rest of the world] along a thousand li [of border] with a million lance-bearers—[the strength of] Ch'in is proportionate to double that of a hundred [enemy].

Its geographical situation is convenient and favorable; when it sends down its troops [from the passes] upon the nobles, it is like [a person] on top of a high building upsetting water into a tile gutter.

Now Ch'i in the east has the richness of Lang-ya and Chi-mo; in the south are the fastnesses of Mount T'ai; in the west are the obstacles on the Muddy River; on the north it has the advantages of the P'o Sea. Its territory is two thousand li square and it has a million lance-bearers. It is marked off and separated [from the rest of the world] along more than a thousand li [of boundary—the strength of] Ch'i is proportionate to double that of ten [enemy]. These are [then] an eastern and a western Ch'in.

Only your own son or your own brother may be sent to be king over Ch'i."

The Emperor replied, "Good."

He gave him [the equivalent of] five hundred catties of gold.

The Emperor returned to Lo-yang and pardoned Han Hsin, appointing him as Marquis of Huai-yin.

On the day chia-shen [the Emperor] first split the tallies and appointed his meritorious subjects, Ts'ao Ts'an and others, as marquises.

An imperial edict said, "Ch'i is an anciently founded state; but now it [has been broken into] commanderies [with their] prefectures. Let it again become [a state with] a nobility.

General Liu Chia has several times performed great deeds; select him and some other persons who are large-hearted and kind, cultivated and pure, to rule over regions in Ch'i and Ching."

In the spring, the first month, on the day ping-wu, the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, and others memorialized [the throne], begging that Liu Chia be made King of Ching, [ruling over] the fifty-three prefectures of the former Tung-yang Commandery, the Chang Commandery, and the Wu Commandery.

and that [the Emperor] set up his younger brother the Wen-hsin Baronet, [Liu] Chiao, as King of Ch'u, [ruling over] the thirty-six prefectures of the Tang Commandery, the Hsieh Commandery, and the T'an Commandery.

On [the day] jen-tzu [the Emperor] set up his older brother, the Yi-hsin Marquis, [Liu] Hsi, as King of Tai, [ruling over] the fifty-three prefectures of the Yün-chung, the Yen-men, and the Tai Commanderies.

He set up his son, [Liu] Fei, as King of Ch'i, [ruling] over the seventy-three prefectures of the Chiao-tung, the Chiao-si, the Lin-tzu, the Chi-pei, the Po-yang, and the Ch'eng-yang commanderies.

[The Emperor] made the kingdom of Han out of the thirty-one prefectures of the T'ai-yüan Commandery, and removed the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, [to it], with his capital at Chin-yang.

When the Emperor had already appointed [to noble positions] twenty odd men of great merit, the rest disputed over their [respective] merits, for which enfeoffments had not yet been made.

When the Emperor was in the Southern Palace, from above on the double passageway, he saw the generals often talking together privately. He asked Chang Liang [about it.

and Chang] Liang said, "Your Majesty conquered the world together with these people. Now you are already the Son of Heaven, and those whom you have enfeoffed are all your old friends and those whom you love, while those whom you have punished with death were all enemies you have made in your life-time, against whom you held a grudge.

Now the army officers are counting up those who have merits and think that the world is insufficient to enfeoff them all, so they fear that for a [trifling] fault they might meet with the punishment of death. Hence they meet and plan to rebel."

The Emperor replied, "What can I do for that?"

[Chang] Liang replied, "Take the persons whom your Majesty has always disliked, figuring out the one whom all your courtiers know [you dislike] the very most, and enfeoff him first in order to show your courtiers [that you really mean them well]."

In the third month the Emperor held a feast and enfeoffed Yüng Ch'ih. Thereupon he urged his Lieutenant Chancellor [Hsiao Ho] to hasten and determine the merits [of the officers] and make the [due] appointments.

When the feast was over, the courtiers were all glad and said, "Even Yung Ch'ih [has been made] a marquis; we have no cause at all for anxiety."

The Emperor returned to Yüeh-yang. Once every five days he would pay homage to the T'ai-kung [his father].

The Household Steward of the T'ai-kung admonished the T'ai-kung, saying, "Heaven has not two suns; the land has not two sovereigns.

Although the Emperor is your son, he is the lord of men. Although you, the T'ai-kung, are his father, you are his subject.

Why should you be the cause of the lord of men making obeisance before one who is his subject? In this way, his majesty and authority are then not exhibited."

Afterwards when the Emperor [came to pay] homage, the T'ai-kung, holding a broom, welcomed him at the door and walked backwards.

The Emperor was greatly startled. He descended and supported the T'ai-kung.

The T'ai-kung said, "The Emperor is the lord of men, why should you overturn the principles of the world on my account?"

On that account the Emperor in his heart approved the words of the Household Steward and granted him five hundred catties of actual gold.

In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] ping wu, an imperial edict said, "Of all the close relationships, none is closer than that of father and son. Therefore when a father possesses the world he hands it down to his son, and when a son possesses the world his dignity reverts to his father—this is the highest perfection of human principles.

In former days the world was in great disturbance, armed troops arose everywhere, and all the people suffered calamities. We Ourself wore armor, wielded a pointed [weapon], and Ourself led Our officers and soldiers, braving danger and difficulty in order to put down the tyrannous and rebellious. We have set up a nobility, ended the war, and given the people rest, [so that] the world [is enjoying] a great peace. This is all [due to] the teaching and instruction of the T'ai-kung [Our father].

The kings, the marquises, the generals, the many ministers, and the Grandees have already honored Us [with the title of] Emperor; but the T'ai-kung has not yet had any title. Now We present to and honor the T'ai-kung with the title of the Grand Emperor."

In the autumn, the ninth month, the Huns besieged the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, at Ma-yi, and [Han] Hsin surrendered to the Huns.

In the seventh year, in the winter, the tenth month, the Emperor in person acting as general attacked the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, at T'ung-ti, and beheaded his general.

[But Han] Hsin escaped and fled to the Huns. Together with his generals, Man-ch'iu Ch'en and Wang Huang, they together set up a descendant of the former king of Chao, Chao Li, as King [of Chao], collected the scattered troops of [Han] Hsin [for him], and, together with the Huns, they resisted [the forces of] the Hans [dynasty].

The Emperor, [starting] from Chin-yang, fought a succession of battles and took advantage of his victories to pursue the defeated. He went to Lou-fan, [where] he met with a severe cold spell, [so that] two or three out of every ten officers and soldiers lost fingers [or toes].

Thereupon he went to P'ing-ch'eng, [where] he was besieged by the Huns for seven days. He used the secret plan of Ch'en P'ing and succeeded in getting out.

[Then] he ordered Fan K'uai to stay in order to subjugate the region of Tai.

In the twelfth month the Emperor returned. He passed through Chao but did not treat the King of Chao courteously.

In this month the Huns attacked Tai, and the King of Tai, [Liu] Hsi, abandoned his state and of his own accord returned to Lo-yang. He was forgiven and made Marquis of Ho-yang.

On [the day] hsin-mao [the Emperor] made his son, [Liu] Ju-yi, King of Tai.

In the spring [the Emperor] ordered that when a Gentleman-of-the-Palace commits a crime [deserving] a more [severe punishment] than that of shaving the whiskers, [the officials] should ask [the throne's consent to the sentence].

and that people who had sons born to them should be exempted from public service for two years.

In the second month he went to Ch'ang-an.

Hsiao Ho was building the Wei-yang Palace, and was erecting the Eastern Portal, the Northern Portal, the Front Hall, the Arsenal, and the Great Granary.

The Emperor saw their greatness and elegance and was very angry. He said to [Hsiao] Ho, "The world is full of tumultuous cries; I have toiled and suffered for many years; my success or failure cannot yet be known—why are you building these palaces and halls beyond measure?"

[Hsiao] Ho replied, "The world is not just yet subjugated—for that reason we should take this opportunity to complete the palaces and halls.

Moreover the Son of Heaven has the four seas [and all within them] for his household. Without great and elegant [buildings], you will not [be able to display] your authority and majesty. We should not moreover let it be that later generations should find anything to be despized."

The Emperor was delighted.

removed from Yüeh-yang, and established his capital at Ch'ang-an.

He established the office of the Superintendency over the Imperial House to arrange the precedence among his nine [classes of] relatives.

In the summer, the fourth month, he went to Lo-yang.

In his eighth year, in the winter, the Emperor went east to attack Han Hsin's remaining robbers at Tung-yüan.

On his return, he went thru [the state of] Chao. The Chancellor of Chao, Kuan Kao, and others [felt] humiliated [because] the Emperor did not extend any courtesy to their King, [and so] secretly plotted, wishing to assassinate the Emperor.

The Emperor was going to pass the night [at a certain place, but] his spirit was moved, so he asked what the name of the prefecture was. He was answered, "Po-jen."

The Emperor said, "A po-jen is a person harassed by someone." He went away and did not spend the night [there].

In the eleventh month [the Emperor] ordered that the officers and soldiers who had died when with the army should be put in provisional coffins and returned to their [home] prefectures; their prefectures should supply their shrouds, their coverlets, their [permanent] coffins, their burials, their [mortuary] furnishings, and should sacrifice [to them] a ram and a pig. The chief officials should supervise their funerals.

In the twelfth month [the Emperor] went from Tung-yüan to [the capital].

In the spring, the third month, he went to Lo-yang.

He ordered that the officials and soldiers who went with the army to P'ing-ch'eng, those who defended the city and the walled towns, should all be exempt from public service for life.

Those whose noble rank was not above that of Public Chariot shall not be allowed to wear the Hat of the House of Liu.

Merchants are not to be permitted to wear brocade, embroidery, flowered silk, crape linen, fine linen, sackcloth, or wool, carry weapons, or ride a quadriga or a horse.

In the autumn, the eighth month, there was a pardon granted to those officials who had committed crimes [but] had not yet been detected.

In the ninth month, [the Emperor] went from Lo-yang to [the capital].

The King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Liang, [P'eng Yüeh], the King of Chao, [Chang Ao], and the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], all accompanied him.

In the ninth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Liang, [P'eng Yüeh], the King of Chao, [Chang Ao], and the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], came to court at the Wei-yang Palace [to pay their homage.

The Emperor] held a feast in the Front Hall. The Emperor held up a jade wine-cup and drank a toast to the health of the Grand Emperor, saying, "At first you, sire, continually thought of me, your servant, as a good-for-nothing, one who could not apply himself to any professional occupation, who was not as industrious as [my brother] Chung.

Now who has achieved the more, I or Chung?"

The many courtiers in the Hall all called out, "Long life," They laughed loudly and made merry.

In the eleventh month [the Emperor] removed to Kuan-chung five great clans of Ch'i and Ch'u: the Chao clan, the Chu clan, the Ching clan, the Huai clan, and the T'ien clan, and gave them the advantage of its fields and dwellings.

In the twelfth month he went to Lo-yang.

The rebellious conspiracy of Kuan Kao and his accomplices were discovered. [Kuan] Kao and his accomplices were arrested and captured; the King of Chao, [Chang] Ao, was also captured and put in prison.

An imperial edict [was issued to the effect that] anyone who dared to follow the king would be punished by [death and] the extermination of his three [sets of] relatives.

[The king's] Gentlemen-of-the-Palace, T'ien Shu, Meng Shu, and others, ten persons [in all], themselves shaved their heads, put on iron collars, made themselves slaves of the king's household, and followed the king to prison.

The king did not really know of [Kuan Kao's] conspiracy.

In the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] dismissed the King of Chao, [Chang] Ao, and made him the Marquis of Hsüan-p'ing.

He moved the King of Tai, [Liu] Ju-yi, to be the King of Chao, ruling over the state of Chao.

Those who, before [the day] ping-yin, had committed crimes not serious enough [to deserve] the punishment of an irrevokable death sentence were all pardoned.

In the second month [the Emperor] went from Lo-yang to [the capital].

[He esteemed as] capable [men] the ten courtiers of Chao, T'ien Shu, Meng Shu, and the others, summoned them to an interview, and conversed with them. None of the courtiers in the Han court were able to surpass the best [efforts] of these men.

The Emperor was delighted and appointed every one of them as Administrators of commanderies or Chancellors of the nobles.

In the summer, the sixth month, on [the day] yi-wei, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the tenth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Yen, [Lu Wan], the King of Ching, [Liu Chia], the King of Liang, [P'eng Yüeh], the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], the King of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], and the King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu Ch'eng], came to court [to render their homage.]

In the summer, the fifth month, the Grand Emperor died.

in the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] kuei-mao, he was buried at Wan-nien.

[The Emperor] pardoned those imprisoned at Yüeh-yang whose crimes were less than those [deserving] death.

In the eighth month he ordered the vassal kings all to set up temples to the Grand Emperor at the capitals of their states.

In the ninth month, the Chancellor of State in Tai, Ch'en Hsi, revolted.

The Emperor said, "[Ch'en] Hsi has acted as my envoy; he has had my entire confidence.

I have been anxious about the region of Tai, hence I appointed [Ch'en] Hsi to be a marquis, and, as Chancellor of State, to guard Tai; but now with Wang Huang and others he has seized and ravaged the region of Tai.

The officials and people [of Tai] have committed no crime; those who can leave [Ch'en] Hsi and [Wang] Huang and come to return [to their allegiance to me] will all be pardoned."

The Emperor reached Han-tan from the east.

[Then] the Emperor was delighted and said, "[Ch'en] Hsi did not come south and hold Han-tan, in order to bar [the passage up] the river Chang. I know that he is really incapable of doing anything."

The Chancellor of Chao, Chou Ch'ang, memorialized [the throne to the effect that] of the twenty-five cities of Ch'ang-shan, twenty cities had been lost. He begged that the Administrator and [Commandary] Commandant be sentenced to death.

The Emperor said, "Have the Administrator and [Commandery] Commandant rebelled?" and was answered, "No."

The Emperor [then] said, "Their strength was inadequate; they have committed no crime."

The Emperor ordered Chou Ch'ang to select some of the valiant gentlemen of Chao who could be commissioned as generals. He reported back, and [the Emperor] interviewed four men.

The Emperor treated them with contempt and scolded them, saying, "You striplings, have you the stuff to be generals?"

The four men blushed for shame, and all fell prostrate to the earth.

The Emperor appointed for each [the income of] a thousand families and made them generals.

His close associates remonstrated with him, saying, "From [the time that you] entered Shu and Hans and [made an expedition] to punish [the state of] Ch'u, you have never yet [given] indiscriminate [rewards]. For what deeds do you now appoint these [people]?"

The Emperor replied, "This is not anything that you understand.

Ch'en Hsi has rebelled, and the regions of Chao and Tai are all in [Ch'en] Hsi's possession.

I used a feathered call-to-arms to summon the empire's troops, but none have yet arrived. Now I can only count on the troops in Han-tan alone.

Why should I be parsimonious about [the income of] four thousand families and not use it to console the young men of Chao?"

They all replied, "You are right."

He also sought whether Yo Yi had any descendants [living], found his grandson, [Yo] Shu, and enfeoffed him at Yo-hsiang, entitling him the Hua-ch'eng Baronet.

[The Emperor] asked about the generals of [Ch'en] Hsi, [and found that] they were all former merchants.

The Emperor said, "Then I know how to deal with them."

So he bribed the generals of [Ch'en] Hsi with much gold, and many of [Ch'en] Hsi's generals surrendered.

In the eleventh year, in the winter, the Emperor was at Han-tan.

A general of [Ch'en] Hsi, Hou Ch'ang, scouted about, leading more than ten thousand men. Wang Huang, leading more than a thousand cavalry, encamped at Ch'ü-ni. Chang Ch'un, leading more than ten thousand foot-soldiers, crossed the [Yellow] River to attack Liao-ch'eng.

a general of the Han [dynasty], Kuo Meng, together with a general of [the state of] Ch'i, attacked [Chang Ch'un] and routed his [troops] severely.

The Grand Commandant, Chou P'o, went by way of the T'ai-yüan [Commandery], entered and subjugated the region of Tai. He went to Ma-yi, [but] Ma-yi would not submit, [so] he attacked and massacred its [people].

A general of [Ch'en] Hsi, Chao Li, was defending Tung-yüan. Kao-tsu attacked it, [but] did not take it.

[Some of] the soldiers [of the town] cursed him. The Emperor became angry.

and, when the city surrendered, those soldiers who had cursed him were beheaded.

Those prefectures which had been firmly defended and did not surrender to the rebellious robbers, were exempted from the land tax and capitation taxes for three years.

In the spring, the first month, the Marquis of Huai-yin, Han Hsin, plotted a revolt at Ch'ang-an. He was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.

General Ch'ai Wu beheaded the King of Han, [Han] Hsin, at Ts'an-ho.

The Emperor returned to Lo-yang.

An imperial edict said, "The territory of Tai is north of [that of] Ch'ang-shan, and borders on [the regions of] the barbarians. Consequently, [the state of] Chao has [to control this territory] from south of the mountains. It is far away [from its administrative headquarters], frequently pillaged [by] the Hu, and has difficulty in being a state.

We will take a bit of the territory of the T'ai-yüan [Commandery] south of the mountains and augment [with it the region] belonging to Tai. [The part of] Tai west of Yün-chung shall become the Yün-chung Commandery. Thus Tai will be suffering less from border raids.

You, kings, chancellors of states, marquises, and officials who [have the rank of] two thousand piculs, should select someone who can be made King of Tai."

The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, the Chancellor of State [Hsiao] Ho, and others, [altogether] thirty-three persons, unanimously replied, "Your son, [Liu] Heng, is capable, wise, gentle, and good. We beg that he be made King of Tai, with his capital at Chin-yang."

A general amnesty for all the world [was proclaimed].

In the second month, an imperial edict said, "[We] wish very much to lessen the poll-taxes.

[but] now the offerings [made to Us] have no regulations, [so that] the officials sometimes make the poll-tax heavy in order to use it for offerings [to Us], and for the vassal kings [this tax] is even heavier, [with the result that] the people suffer from it.

Henceforth the vassal kings and marquises shall regularly pay court and make offerings [to Us, the Emperor], in the tenth month, and each commandery shall [make an offering] in accordance with the total number of its people; each person per year [shall be taxed] sixty-three cash in order to provide for the expense of making offerings [to the Emperor]."

[The edict] also said, "Verily [We] have heard that no [true] king was greater than [King] Wen of the Chou [dynasty] and no Lord Protector was greater than [Duke] Huan of Ch'i—both needed capable men in order to make a name for themselves.

At present in the world there are capable men who are wise and able; why should only men of ancient times [be capable]?

The trouble is that the ruler of men does not meet them. By what means could a gentleman have access [to me]?

Now I, by the spiritual power of Heaven, [and by my] capable gentlemen and high officials have subjugated and possess the empire and have made it one family. I wish it to be enduring, that generation after generation should worship at my ancestral temple without cessation.

Capable persons have already shared with me in its pacification. Should it be that [any capable persons] are not to share together with me in its comfort and its benefits?

If there are any capable gentlemen or sirs who are willing to follow and be friends with me, I can make them honorable and illustrious.

Let [the foregoing] be published to [all] the world, to make plain Our intention.

Let the Grandee Secretary [Chao] Yao transmit it to the Chancellor of State; let the Chancellor of State [Hsiao Ho], the Marquis of Tso, transmit it to the vassal kings; the Palace Secretary for Administrating the Laws shall transmit it to the Commandery Administrators. If any [among their people] have an excellent reputation and manifest virtue, [the officials] must personally urge [them to come], provide them with a quadriga, and send them to go to the courts of the Chancellor of State to have written down their accomplishments, their appearance, and their age.

If there are [such ones] and [any official] does not report them, when [this fact] becomes known, he shall be dismissed.

Those who are aged, infirm, or ill should not be sent."

In the third month, the King of Liang, P'eng Yüeh, plotted a rebellion. He was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.

The imperial edict said, "Do you select [some persons] who can be made the King of Liang and the King of Huai-yang."

The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, the Chancellor of State [Hsiao] Ho, and others begged [the Emperor] to establish his son, [Liu] K'uei, as the King of Liang, and his son, [Liu] Yu, as the King of Huai-yang.

[The Emperor] reduced considerably the Tung Commandery and added a part of it to [the state of] Liang. He [also] reduced considerably the Ying-ch'uan Commandery and added a part of it to [the state of] Huai-yang.

In the summer, the fourth month, [the Emperor] went from Lo-yang to [the capital].

He ordered that the people of Feng who had been moved to Kuan-chung should all be exempted [from taxes and service] for life.

In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "According to the customs of the people of [Nan-] Yüeh, they like to attack each other. At a previous time, the Ch'in [dynasty] moved people from the central prefectures to the three commanderies of the southern quarter, and sent them to live intermixed with the many [tribes of] the Yüeh.

It happened that when the world punished the Ch'in [dynasty], the [Commandery] Commandant of Nan-hai, [Chao] T'o, was living in the southern quarter and ruling it as its chieftain. He has made an excellent arrangement [of his government, so that] the people from the central prefectures have hence not diminished [in number] and the custom of the people of Yüeh to attack each other is progressively ceasing. For all [the foregoing, the region] is in debt to his ability.

Now We establish [Chao] T'o as King of Nan-yüeh.

and commission Lu Chia to transmit his kingly seal and [its] cord."

[Chao] T'o made obeisance [to the Emperor's edict] and acknowledged himself as [Kao-tsu's] subject.

In the sixth month [the Emperor] ordered that the officers and soldiers who had followed him into Shu, Hans, and Kuan-chung should all be exempted [from taxes and military service] for life.

In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing] Pu, revolted.

The Emperor asked the generals [for a plan of campaign]. The Lord of Teng [Hsia-hou Ying] said that the former Chief Administrator of Ch'u, his excellency Hsieh, had formed a plan.

and the Emperor saw his excellency. His excellency Hsieh told about [Ch'ing] Pu's circumstances, and the Emperor approved his [plan] and appointed his excellency Hsieh [to the income of] a thousand families.

[The Emperor next issued] an edict that the kings and the Chancellor of State should select [someone] who could be made King of Huai-nan. His subjects [the kings and chancellors] begged that he make his son, [Liu] Ch'ang, its king.

The Emperor thereupon mobilized as the Imperial Heir-apparent's Guard, chariots and cavalry from the Shang commandery, from the Pei-ti [Commandery], and from the Lung-hsi [Commandery], skilled soldiers from Pa and Shu, together with thirty thousand of the soldiers [belonging to] the Palace Military Commander, and had them encamp at Pa-shang.

[Ch'ing] Pu really [did] as his excellency Hsieh had said: he went eastwards, attacked and killed the King of Ching, Liu Chia, seized his troops, crossed the Huai [River], and attacked [the state of] Ch'u. The King of Ch'u, [Liu] Chiao, fled to Hsieh.

The Emperor granted a pardon to [everyone in] the world except [those guilty of] capital crimes, and ordered them all to enlist in the army. He summoned the troops of the nobles, and, with the Emperor in person acting as general, attacked [Ch'ing] Pu.

In his twelfth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the Emperor routed [the army of Ch'ing] Pu at Kuei-chui.

[Ch'ing] Pu fled. [The Emperor] ordered a detached general to pursue him.

The Emperor, on his return, passed thru P'ei, and stopped to make a feast in the palace at P'ei. He summoned all his friends, elders and young people, to attend the feast.

He sent out for the children of P'ei, secured a hundred and twenty persons, and taught them some songs.

At the height of the drinking, the Emperor struck a five-stringed lute, and himself sang as follows: "A great wind raged And the clouds flew and rose. When my authority had been imposed upon [all] within the [four] seas, I returned to my native village. How may I secure valiant men To defend the four quarters [of my empire]?"

He ordered all the children to reiterate it in concert.

then the Emperor arose and danced. In sadness of mind and grieving in spirit many tears rolled down [his cheeks].

and he said to the elders of P'ei, "The wanderer is saddened in his native village.

Altho I [make] my capital in Kuan-chung, after my life is over, my spirit will rejoice as it thinks of P'ei.

Moreover, [beginning] from [the humble rank of] the Lord of P'ei, We have punished with extermination the tyrannous and rebellious [dynasty of Ch'in] and thereafter possessed the empire. Let P'ei become Our private town. [We] exempt its people from generation to generation, not [requiring] them to provide anything [for the public treasury]."

The elders, the matrons, and his old friends at P'ei [spent their time for] days rejoicing and drinking, extremely pleased and telling of [his] former [doings] in order to laugh and rejoice.

[After] more than ten days, the Emperor wished to leave, [but] the elders of P'ei insistently begged him [to stay].

The Emperor said, "My people are quite numerous; you, Elders, are not able to provide [for them]." Thereupon he departed.

Those who were in P'ei emptied the city and all came to the west of the town to make offerings.

The Emperor stopped and stayed [there], and banqueted them in a tent for three days.

The elders of P'ei all knocked their heads to the ground [before Kao-tsu] and said, "P'ei has happily obtained exemption, but Feng has not obtained it—if only your Majesty would take pity upon it!"

The Emperor replied, "Feng is where I was born and raised; I could never forget it.

But I [cannot exempt it] because it formerly revolted against me for the sake of Yung Ch'ih [and gave its allegiance] to Weih."

The elders of P'ei insistently begged him, so he also exempted Feng like P'ei.

The detached general of the Han [dynasty] attacked the army of [Ch'ing] Pu north and south of the River Pi, and at both places routed it severely. [Then] he caught up with and decapitated [Ch'ing] Pu at P'o-yang.

Chou P'o subjugated Tai and beheaded Ch'en Hsi at Tang-ch'eng.

An imperial edict said, "Wu was an anciently established state.

In the past, the King of Ching [Liu Chia] has also had its territory. Now that he has died without issue.

We wish again to establish a king of Wu. Let it be discussed who is able [to occupy this position]."

The King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu] Ch'en, and others said, "The Marquis of P'ei, [Liu] P'i, is dignified and sincere; we beg that you establish him as King of Wu."

When he had already been installed [as King], the Emperor summoned him and said to [Liu] P'i, "Your appearance has the look of a rebel."

So he patted him on the back and said, "If, [within] the coming fifty years, the Han [dynasty] has a revolt in the southeast, would it be you?

The world is however [now subservient to] one house and is all one family; you must be careful not to rebel."

[Liu] P'i knocked his head on the ground and said, "I would not dare [to do so]."

In the eleventh month, [the Emperor] travelled from Huai-nan and returned [to the capital].

He passed thru Lu and sacrificed to Confucius, offering him a suevotaurilia.

In the twelfth month an imperial edict said, "The [First] Emperor of the Ch'in [dynasty], King Yin of Ch'u [Ch'en Shê], King An-hsi of Weih, King Min of Ch'i, and King Tao-hsiang of Chao, all have had their lines of descent cut off, being without issue.

Let there be twenty families as the grave-keepers of the First Emperor of Ch'in; [for] each of [these kings of] Ch'u, of Weih, and of Ch'i, [let there be] ten families; [for] each of [the king of] Chao and the Prince of Weih, Wu-chi, [let there be] five families. We order that [these families] should watch with care the tumuli [to the care of which they have been assigned] and that they should be exempted and not made to give any other service."

A general of Ch'en Hsi who had surrendered told that when [Ch'en] Hsi rebelled, the King of Yen, Lu Wan, had sent men to the place where [Ch'en] Hsi was, to plot secretly.

When the Emperor sent the Marquis of Pi-yang, Shen Yi-chi, to go to escort [Lu] Wan [to the capital, Lu] Wan feigned sickness.

[so that Shen] Yi-chi reported that there were signs that [Lu] Wan had rebelled.

In the spring, the second month, [the Emperor] sent Fan K'uai and Chou P'o, with troops, to attack [Lu] Wan.

The imperial edict said, "The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, was an old friend of mine, and I loved him like a son. When I heard that he had plotted with Ch'en Hsi, I thought there was no such thing, hence I sent an envoy to escort [Lu] Wan [to the capital.

But Lu] Wan feigned sickness and did not come, [so that] it is evident he has planned to rebel.

The officials and people of Yen have committed no crime. I grant to each of its officials who have the rank of six hundred piculs and above, one step [in noble rank].

to those who have been [in revolt] with [Lu] Wan [but] leave him and come to return [to their allegiance to me], I will grant pardon and also add one step in noble rank."

An edict [ordered that] the vassal kings should discuss who should be made King of Yen.

The King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu] Ch'en, and others begged that [the Emperor] establish his son [Liu] Chien as King of Yen.

An imperial edict said, "The Marquis of Nan-wu, Chih, is also a descendent of Yüeh; We establish him as King of Nan-hai."

In the third month an imperial edict said, "I have been made the Son of Heaven, and as Emperor have now possessed the world for twelve years until the present.

Together with the brave officers and talented grandees of the empire I have subjugated the empire; together we have pacified and reunited it.

Among those [of my followers] who have distinguished themselves, I have established the best as kings, the next [best] as marquises, and the least have moreover been given the income of towns.

Moreover some of the relatives of my important subjects have become marquises. All have been themselves authorized to establish their officials and levy taxes. Their daughters have become Princesses.

The marquises who have the income of towns all wear seals; we have granted them large residences.

The officials [of the rank of] two thousand piculs We moved to Ch'ang-an to receive small residences.

Those who went to Shu and Hans and subjugated the three [parts of the state of] Ch'in are all exempted [from taxes and services] from generation to generation.

Towards the worthy officers and meritorious officials of the empire I may be said not to have been ungrateful.

Let those who unrighteously rebel against the Son of Heaven and arbitrarily raise troops be punished by the united military forces of the empire and be executed.

Let this be published and announced to the world to let it clearly understand Our intention."

When the Emperor was fighting against [Ch'ing] Pu, he had been wounded by a stray arrow; as he was traveling along he became ill.

When his illness became severe the Empress [née] Lü called a good physician.

When the physician entered and saw him, the Emperor asked the physician.

"Can my sickness be healed?" The physician replied, "It can be healed."

Thereupon the Emperor scolded him, [using] disrespectful [language], "I took possession of the world as a humble citizen wielding a sword—was not this [achievement by] the Decree of Heaven?

My fate is then with Heaven; altho Pien Ch'io [were here], what use could he be?"

Therefore he did not let him treat his sickness, but granted him fifty catties of actual gold and dismissed him.

The Empress [née] Lü asked, "After your Majesty's decease, when the Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho] has died, whom should I order to take his place?"

The Emperor said, "Ts'ao Ts'an can [be chosen.]"

She [then] asked who next, and he replied, "Wang Ling can [be chosen]. However he is a little stupid, [so] Ch'en P'ing can [be chosen] to assist him.

Ch'en P'ing has superabundent intelligence, but he would find it difficult to bear the responsibility alone.

Chou P'o is dignified and sincere, [but] he is not very polished; yet the one who will assure the peace of the house of Liu must be [Chou] P'o. He could be made Grand Commandant."

The Empress [née] Lü again asked who next, and the Emperor replied, "After that you too will not know [things]."

Lu Wan with several thousand men stayed at the foot of the Barrier, waiting, if by good chance the Emperor's sickness should become better, to come in person to beg for pardon.

[But] in the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en, the Emperor died in the Ch'ang-lo Palace.

When Lu Wan heard of it, he thereupon fled to the Huns.

The Empress [née] Lü plotted with Shen Yi-chi, saying, "The generals together with the Emperor formerly came from families enregistered as common people; when they faced north as courtiers, in their hearts they have always felt dissatisfied, and now they [will] nevertheless [have to] serve the young lord [his son]. If they are not all completely exterminated together with their families, the empire will not be at peace."

For this reason [the Empress] did not [announce the death and] proclaim a mourning.

Someone heard of it and spoke to Li Shang.

[Li] Shang saw Shen Yi-chi and said [to him], "I have heard that the Emperor has already been dead for four days, and that [the Empress] has not proclaimed any mourning and wishes to kill the generals.

If [the situation] is really like this, the empire is certainly in danger.

Ch'en P'ing and Kuan Ying, leading a hundred thousand [men], defend Jung yang; Fan K'uai and Chou P'o, leading two hundred thousand [men], are subjugating Yen and Tai— when these [people] hear that the Emperor has died and the generals have all been killed, they will certainly turn about face with their troops in order to attack Kuan-chung.

With the great ministers revolting inside [the passes] and the generals turning against [the dynasty] outside [the passes], it could await its destruction on tiptoe."

Shen Yi-chi entered and told these [words to the Empress]. So on [the day] ting-wei [the Empress] proclaimed a mourning and granted a general amnesty to the world.

In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-yin, [the Emperor] was buried in the Ch'ang Tomb.

When [the coffin] had been put in place, the imperial heir-apparent and the courtiers all returned and went to the temple of the Grand Emperor.

The courtiers said, "The Emperor arose from humble [beginnings]; he established order in a troubled generation, and turned it back to the right [path]. He pacified and subjugated the world, and became the Grand Founder of the Han [dynasty]. His achievements were very great.

We offer him the high title of Kao-huang-ti."

In his early life, Kao-tsu did not cultivate literary studies, but by nature he was intelligent and penetrating. He liked to make plans and was able to listen [to others]. From a superintendent of a gate or a man exiled to the frontier [upwards, anyone] who came to see him [was treated] as an old [friend].

At the beginning [of his reign] he conformed to the people's wishes when he made an agreement [with them] in three articles.

when the empire had been subjugated, he commanded Hsiao Ho to set in order the [criminal] laws and orders, Han Hsin to set forth the military methods, Chang Ts'ang to fix the calendar and measures, Shu-sun T'ung to establish the rites and etiquette, and Lu Chia to compose the Hsin-yü.

With his meritorious followers he split tallies and made oaths, with red writing and an iron certificate, a golden box and a stone chest, and kept them in the ancestral temple.

Altho daily no leisure was afforded him, his designs and plans were vast and far-reaching.

In eulogy we say, In `Spring and Autumn' [times], the historian of [the state of] Chin, Ts'ai Mo, said, "When the T'ao and T'ang family had lost its power, among its descendants there was a Liu Lei who learned to train dragons. He served K'ung-chia. The Fan family were his descendants."

Moreover the Grandee Fan Hsientzu also said, "My ancestors before [the time of] Yü [Shun] were surnamed T'ao and T'ang; in the [time of the] Hsia [dynasty], they were surnamed Yü-lung; in [the time of] the Shang [dynasty], they were surnamed Shih-wei; in [the time of] the Chou [dynasty], they were surnamed T'ang and Tu; when [the state of] Chin became the lord of China's oaths, they were surnamed Fan.

A [member of the] Fan [family] was the Supreme Judge of Chin. In the time of Duke Wen of Lu, [the family] fled to Ch'in.

Later they returned to Chin. Those [of the Fan family] who remained [in Ch'in] became the Liu family."

Liu Hsiang said, "In the time of the Contending States, [a member of] the Liu family from Ch'in was made prisoner of war by Weih.

When [the state of] Ch'in destroyed [the state of] Weih, [the family] moved to Ta-liang and dwelt at Feng. Hence Chou Fu said to Yung Ch'ih, `Feng was formerly a colony of Liang.'

Thus the eulogy of Kao-tsu said, `The line of descent of the Han Emperor Is traced from the Emperor T'ang [Yao]. Coming on down to the Chou [dynasty], In [the state of] Ch'in it became the Liu [family]. It crossed into Weih and went eastwards. Thereupon [its head] became the Lord of Feng.' "

The Lord of Feng was indeed the Grand Emperor's father.

The period since his moving [to Feng] had been brief, [for] there are few mounds or graves [of the family] at Feng.

When Kao-tsu took the throne, he established officials for the worship [of his ancestors], so there were shamans from Ch'in, Chin, Liang, and Ching. For generations the worship of Heaven and Earth has been accompanied by the worship [of these ancestors]. How could [these facts] be untrustworthy?

From the foregoing [accounts] we infer that the Han [dynasty] succeeded to the fortunes of Yao; its virtues and the happiness recompensing it are already great. The cutting in two of the snake, the auspicious omens which appeared, the banners and pennons which emphasized [the color] red in harmony with the virtue of fire, were responses which came of their own accord, [thereby showing that Kao-tsu] secured the [dynastic] rule from Heaven.</div>
