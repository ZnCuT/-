          <div class="txt">高祖，沛丰邑中阳里人也，姓刘氏。

母媪尝息大泽之陂，梦与神遇。是时雷电晦冥，父太公往视，则见蛟龙于上。已而有娠，遂产高祖。

高祖为人，隆准而龙颜，美须髯，左股有七十二黑子。

宽仁爱人，意豁如也。常有大度，不事家人生产作业。

及壮，试吏，为泗上亭长，廷中吏无所不狎侮。

好酒及色。常从王媪、武负贳酒，时饮醉卧，武负、王媪见其上常有怪。

高祖每酤留饮，酒雠数倍。及见怪，岁竟，此两家常折券弃责。

高祖常徭咸阳，纵观秦皇帝，喟然大息，曰：“嗟乎，大丈夫当如此矣！”

单父人吕公善沛令，辟仇，从之客，因家焉。

沛中豪杰吏闻令有重客，皆往贺。

萧何为主吏，主进，令诸大夫曰：“进不满千钱，坐之堂下。”

高祖为亭长，素易诸吏，乃绐为谒曰“贺钱万”，实不持一钱。

谒入，吕公大惊，起，迎之门。

吕公者，好相人，见高祖状貌，因重敬之，引入坐上坐。

萧何曰：“刘季固多大言，少成事。”

高祖因狎侮诸客，遂坐上坐，无所诎。

酒阑，吕公因目固留高祖。

竟酒，后。吕公曰：“臣少好相人，相人多矣，无如季相，愿季自爱。

臣有息女，愿为箕帚妾。”

酒罢，吕媪怒吕公曰：“公始常欲奇此女，与贵人。

沛令善公，求之不与，何自妄许与刘季？”

吕公曰：“此非兒女子所知。”卒与高祖。

吕公女即吕后也，生孝惠帝、鲁元公主。

高祖尝告归之田。

吕后与两子居田中，有一老父过，请饮，吕后因餔之。

老父相后曰：“夫人天下贵人也。”

令相两子，见孝惠帝，曰：“夫人所以贵者，乃此男也。”

相鲁元公主，亦皆贵。

老父已去，高祖适从旁舍来，吕后具言：“客有过，相我子母皆大贵。”

高祖问，曰：“未远。”乃追及，问老父。

老父曰：“乡者夫人兒子皆以君，君相贵不可言。”

高祖乃谢曰：“诚如父言，不敢忘德。”

及高祖贵，遂不知老父处。

高祖为亭长，乃以竹皮为冠，令求盗之薛治，时时冠之，及贵常冠，所谓“刘氏冠”也。

高祖以亭长为县送徒骊山，徒多道亡。

自度比至皆亡之，到丰西泽中亭，止饮，夜皆解纵所送徒，曰：“公等皆去，吾亦从此逝矣！”

徒中壮士愿从者十余人。

高祖被酒，夜径泽中，令一人行前。

行前者还报曰：“前有大蛇当径，愿还。”

高祖醉，曰：“壮士行，何畏！”乃前，拔剑斩蛇。

蛇分为两，道开。

行数里，醉困卧。

后人来至蛇所，有一老妪夜哭。

人问妪何哭，妪曰：“人杀吾子。”

人曰：“妪子何为见杀？”

妪曰：“吾子，白帝子也，化为蛇当道，今者赤帝子斩之，故哭。”

人乃以妪为不诚，欲苦之，妪因忽不见。

后人至，高祖觉。告高祖，高祖乃心独喜，自负。

诸从者日益畏之。

秦始皇帝尝曰“东南有天子气”，于是东游以猒当之。

高祖隐于芒、砀山泽间，吕后与人俱求，常得之。

高祖怪问吕后，后曰：“季所居上常有云气，故从往常得季。”

高祖又喜。沛中子弟或闻之，多欲附者。

秦二世元年秋七月，陈涉起蕲。

至陈，自立为楚王，遣武臣、张耳、陈馀略赵地。

八月，武臣自立为赵王。

郡县多杀长吏以应涉。

九月，沛令欲以沛应之。

掾、主吏萧何、曹参曰：“君为秦吏，今欲背之，帅沛子弟，恐不听。

愿君召诸亡在外者，可得数百人，因以劫众，众不敢不听。”

乃令樊哙召高祖。

高祖之众已数百人矣。

于是樊哙从高祖来。

沛令后悔，恐其有变，乃闭城城守，欲诛萧、曹。

萧、曹恐，逾城保高祖。

高祖乃书帛射城上，与沛父老曰：

“天下同苦秦久矣。今父老虽为沛令守，诸侯并起，今屠沛。

沛今共诛令，择可立立之，以应诸侯，即室家完。

不然，父子俱屠，无为也。”

父老乃帅子弟共杀沛令，开城门迎高祖，欲以为沛令。

高祖曰：“天下方扰，诸侯并起，今置将不善，一败涂地。

吾非敢自爱，恐能薄，不能完父兄子弟。

此大事，愿更择可者。”

萧、曹皆文吏，自爱，恐事不就，后秦种族其家，尽让高祖。

诸父老皆曰：“平生所闻刘季奇怪，当贵，且卜筮之，莫如刘季最吉。”

高祖数让，众莫肯为，高祖乃立为沛公。

祠黄帝，祭蚩尤于沛廷，而衅鼓旗。

帜皆赤，由所杀蛇白帝子，杀者赤帝子故也。

于是少年豪吏如萧、曹、樊哙等皆为收沛子弟，得三千人。

是月，项梁与兄子羽起吴。

田儋与从弟荣、横起齐，自立为齐王。

韩广自立为燕王。

魏咎自立为魏王。

陈涉之将周章西入关，至戏，秦将章邯距破之。

秦二年十月，沛公攻胡陵、方与，还守丰。

秦泗川监平将兵围丰。

二日，出与战，破之。

令雍齿守丰。

十一月，沛公引兵之薛。

秦泗川守壮兵败于薛，走至戚，沛公左司马得杀之。

沛公还军亢父，至方与。

赵王武臣为其将所杀。

十二月，楚王陈涉为其御所杀。

魏人周巿略地丰、沛，使人谓雍齿曰：“丰，故梁徙也。

今魏地已定者数十城，齿今下魏，魏以齿为侯守丰；不下，且屠丰。”

雍齿雅不欲属沛公，及魏招之，即反为魏守丰。

沛公攻丰，不能取。

沛公还之沛，怨雍齿与丰子弟畔之。

正月，张耳等立赵后赵歇为赵王。

东阳甯君、秦嘉立景驹为楚王，在留。

沛公往从之，道得张良，遂与俱见景驹，请兵以攻丰。

时章邯从陈，别将司马将兵北定楚地，屠相，至砀。

东阳甯君、沛公引兵西，与战萧西，不利，还收兵聚留。

二月，攻砀，三日拔之。

收砀兵，得六千人，与故合九千人。

三月，攻下邑，拔之。

还击丰，不下。

四月，项梁击杀景驹、秦嘉，止薛，沛公往见之。

项梁益沛公卒五千人，五大夫将十人。

沛公还，引兵攻丰，拔之。

雍齿奔魏。

五月，项羽拔襄城还。

项梁尽召别将。

六月，沛公如薛，与项梁共立楚怀王孙心为楚怀王。

章邯破杀魏王咎、齐王田儋于临济。

七月，大霖雨。

沛公攻亢父。

章邯围田荣于东阿。

沛公与项梁共救田荣，大破章邯东阿。

田荣归，沛公、项羽追北，至城阳，攻屠其城。

军濮阳东，复与章邯战，又破之。

章邯复振，守濮阳，环水。

沛公、项羽去攻定陶。

八月，田荣立田儋子市为齐王。

定陶未下，沛公与项羽西略地至雍丘，与秦军战，大败之，斩三川守李由。

还攻外黄，外黄未下。

项梁再破秦军，有骄色。

宋义谏，不听。

秦益章邯兵。

九月，章邯夜衔枚击项梁定陶，大破之，杀项梁。

时连雨自七月至九月。

沛公、项羽方攻陈留，闻梁死，士卒恐，乃与将军吕臣引兵而东，徙怀王自盱台都彭城。

吕臣军彭城东，项羽军彭城西，沛公军砀。

魏咎弟豹自立为魏王。

后九月，怀王并吕臣、项羽军自将之。

以沛公为砀郡长，封武安侯，将砀郡兵。

以羽为鲁公，封长安侯。

吕臣为司徒，其父吕青为令尹。

章邯已破项梁，以为楚地兵不足忧，乃渡河北击赵王歇，大破之。

歇保巨鹿城，秦将王离围之。

赵数请救，怀王乃以宋义为上将，项羽为次将，范增为末将，北救赵。

初，怀王与诸将约，先入定关中者王之。

当是时，秦兵强，常乘胜逐北，诸将莫利先入关。

独羽怨秦破项梁，奋势，愿与沛公西入关。

怀王诸老将皆曰：“项羽为人慓悍祸贼，尝攻襄城，襄城无噍类，所过无不残灭。

且楚数进取，前陈王、项梁皆败，不如更遣长者扶义而西，告谕秦父兄。

秦父兄苦其主久矣，今诚得长者往，毋侵暴，宜可下。

项羽不可遣，独沛公素宽大长者。”

卒不许羽，而遣沛公西收陈王、项梁散卒。

乃道砀至城阳与杠里，攻秦军壁，破其二军。

秦三年十月，齐将田都畔田荣，将兵助项羽救赵。

沛公攻破东郡尉于成武。

十一月，项羽杀宋义，并其兵渡河，自立为上将军，诸将黥布等皆属。

十二月，沛公引兵至栗，遇刚武侯，夺其军四千余人，并之，与魏将皇欣、武满军合攻秦军，破之。

故齐王建孙田安下济北，从项羽救赵。

羽大破秦军巨鹿下，虏王离，走章邯。

二月，沛公从砀北攻昌邑，遇彭越。

越助攻昌邑，未下。

沛公西过高阳，郦食其为里监门，曰：“诸将过此者多，吾视沛公大度。”

乃求见沛公。

沛公方踞床，使两女子洗。

郦生不拜，长揖曰：“足下必欲诛无道秦，不宜踞见长者。”

于是沛公起，摄衣谢之，延上坐。

食其说沛公袭陈留。

沛公以为广野君，以其弟商为将，将陈留兵。

三月，攻开封，未拔。

西与秦将杨熊会战白马，又战曲遇东，大破之。

杨熊走之荥阳，二世使使斩之以徇。

四月，南攻颍川，屠之。

因张良遂略韩地。

时赵别将司马卬方欲渡河入关，沛公乃北攻平阴，绝河津。

南，战雒阳东，军不利，从轘辕至阳城，收军中马骑。

六月，与南阳守齮战犨东，破之。

略南阳郡，南阳守走，保城守宛。

沛公引兵过宛西。

张良谏曰：“沛公虽欲急入关，秦兵尚众，距险。

今不下宛，宛从后击，强秦在前，此危道也。”

于是沛公乃夜引军从他道还，偃旗帜，迟明，围宛城三匝。

南阳守欲自刭，其舍人陈恢曰：“死未晚也。”

乃逾城见沛公，曰：“臣闻足下约先入咸阳者王之，今足下留守宛。

宛郡县连城数十，其吏民自以为降必死，故皆坚守乘城。

今足下尽日止攻，士死伤者必多；引兵去，宛必随足下。

前则失咸阳之约，后有强宛之患。

为足下计，莫若约降，封其守，因使止守，引其甲卒与之西。

诸城未下者，闻声争开门而待足下，足下通行无所累。”

沛公曰：“善。”

七月，南阳守齮降，封为殷侯，封陈恢千户。

引兵西，无不下者。

至丹水，高武侯鳃、襄侯王陵降。

还攻胡阳，遇番君别将梅鋗，与偕攻析、郦，皆降。

所过毋得卤掠，秦民喜。

遣魏人甯昌使秦。

是月，章邯举军降项羽，羽以为雍王。

瑕丘申阳下河南。

八月，沛公攻武关，入秦。

秦相赵高恐，乃杀二世，使人来，欲约分王关中，沛公不许。

九月，赵高立二世兄子子婴为秦王。

子婴诛灭赵高，遣将将兵距峣关。

沛公欲击之，张良曰：“秦兵尚强，未可轻。

愿先遣人益张旗帜于山上为疑兵，使郦食其、陆贾往说秦将，啗以利。”

秦将果欲连和，沛公欲许之。

张良曰：“此独其将欲叛，恐其士卒不从，不如因其怠懈击之。”

沛公引兵绕峣关，逾蒉山，击秦军，大破之蓝田南。

遂至蓝田，又战其北，秦兵大败。

元年冬十月，五星聚于东井。

沛公至霸上。

秦王子婴素车白马，系颈以组，封皇帝玺、符、节、降枳道旁。

诸将或言诛秦王，沛公曰：“始怀王遣我，固以能宽容，且人已服降，杀之不祥。”

乃以属吏。

遂西入咸阳。

欲止宫休舍，樊哙、张良谏，乃封秦重宝财物府库，还军霸上。

萧何尽收秦丞相府图籍文书。

十一月，召诸县豪桀曰：“父老苦秦苛法久矣，诽谤者族，耦语者弃市。

吾与诸侯约，先入关者王之，吾当王关中。

与父老约法三章耳：杀人者死，伤人及盗抵罪。

余悉除去秦法。

吏民皆按堵如故。

凡吾所以来，为父兄除害，非有所侵暴，毋恐！

且吾所以军霸上，待诸侯至而定要束耳。”

乃使人与秦吏行至县、乡、邑告谕之。

秦民大喜，争持牛、羊、酒食献享军士。

沛公让不受，曰：“仓粟多，不欲费民。”

民又益喜，唯恐沛公不为秦王。

或说沛公曰：“秦富十倍天下，地形强。

今闻章邯降项羽，羽号曰雍王，王关中。

即来，沛公恐不得有此。

可急使守函谷关，毋内诸侯军，稍征关中兵以自益，距之。”

沛公然其计，从之。

十二月，项羽果帅诸侯兵欲西入关，关门闭。

闻沛公已定关中，羽大怒，使黥布等攻破函谷关，遂至戏下。

沛公左司马曹毋伤闻羽怒，欲攻沛公，使人言羽曰：“沛公欲王关中，令子婴相，珍宝尽有之。”

欲以求封。

亚父范增说羽曰：“沛公居山东时，贪财好色。

今闻其入关，珍物无所取，妇女无所幸，此其志不小。

吾使人望其气，皆为龙，成五色，此天子气。

急击之，勿失。”

于是飨士，旦日合战。

是时，羽兵四十万，号百万。

沛公兵十万，号二十万，力不敌。

会羽季父左尹项伯素善张良，夜驰见张良，具告其实，欲与俱去，毋特俱死。

良曰：“臣为韩王送沛公，不可不告，亡去不义。”

乃与项伯俱见沛公。

沛公与伯约为婚姻，曰：“吾入关，秋毫无所敢取，籍吏民，封府库，待将军。

所以守关者，备他盗也。

日夜望将军到，岂敢反邪！

愿伯明言不敢背德。”

项伯许诺，即夜复去，戒沛公曰：“旦日不可不早自来谢。”

项伯还，具以沛公言告羽，因曰：“沛公不先破关中兵，公巨能入乎？

且人有大功，击之不祥，不如因善之。”

羽许诺。

沛公旦日从百余骑见羽鸿门，谢曰：“臣与将军戮力攻秦，将军战河北，臣战河南，不自意先入关，能破秦，与将军复相见。

今者有小人言，令将军与臣有隙。”

羽曰：“此沛公左司马曹毋伤言之，不然，籍何以至此？”

羽因留沛公饮。

范增数目羽击沛公，羽不应。

范增起，出谓项庄曰：“君王为人不忍，汝入以剑舞，因击沛公，杀之。

不者，汝属且为所虏。”

庄入为寿。

寿毕，曰：“军中无以为乐，请以剑舞。”

因拔剑舞。

项伯亦起舞，常以身翼蔽沛公。

樊哙闻事急，直入，怒甚。

羽壮之，赐以酒。

哙因谯让羽。

有顷，沛公起如厕，招樊哙出，置车官属，独骑，樊哙、靳强、滕公、纪成步，从间道走军，使张良留谢羽。

羽问：“沛公安在？”

曰：“闻将军有意督过之，脱身去，间至军，故使臣献璧。”

羽受之。

又献玉斗范增。

增怒，撞其斗，起曰：“吾属今为沛公虏矣！”

沛公归数日，羽引兵西屠咸阳，杀秦降王子婴，烧秦宫室，所过残灭，秦民大失望。

羽使人还报怀王，怀王曰：“如约。”

羽怨怀王不肯令与沛公俱西入关而北救赵，后天下约。

乃曰：“怀王者，吾家所立耳，非有功伐，何以得专主约！

本定天下，诸将与籍也。”

春正月，阳尊怀王为义帝，实不用其命。

二月，羽自立为西楚霸王，王梁、楚地九郡，都彭城。

背约，更立沛公为汉王，王巴、蜀、汉中四十一县，都南郑。

三分关中，立秦三将，章邯为雍王，都废丘；

司马欣为塞王，都栎阳；董翳为翟王，都高奴。

楚将瑕丘申阳为河南王，都洛阳。

赵将司马卬为殷王，都朝歌。

当阳君英布为九江王，都六。

怀王柱国共敖为临江王，都江陵。

番君吴芮为衡山王，都邾。

故齐王建孙田安为济北王。

徙魏王豹为西魏王，都平阳。

徙燕王韩广为辽东王。

燕将臧荼为燕王，都蓟。

徙齐王田市为胶东王。

齐将田都为齐王，都临菑。

徙赵王歇为代王。

赵相张耳为常山王。

汉王怨羽之背约，欲攻之，丞相萧何谏，乃止。

夏四月，诸侯罢戏下，各就国。

羽使卒三万人从汉王，楚子、诸侯人之慕从者数万人，从杜南入蚀中。

张良辞归韩，汉王送至褒中，因说汉王烧绝栈道，以备诸侯盗兵，亦视项羽无东意。

汉王既至南郑，诸将及士卒皆歌讴思东归，多道亡还者。

韩信为治粟都尉，亦亡去。

萧何追还之，因荐于汉王，曰：“必欲争天下，非信无可与计事者。”

于是汉王齐戒设坛场，拜信为大将军，问以计策。

信对曰：“项羽背约而王君王于南郑，是迁也。

吏卒毕山东之人，日夜企而望归，及其锋而用之，可以有大功。

天下已定，民皆自宁，不可复用。

不如决策东向。”

因陈羽可图、三秦易并之计。

汉王大说，遂听信策，部署诸将。

留萧何收巴、蜀租，给军粮食。

五月，汉王引兵从故道出袭雍。

雍王邯迎击汉陈仓，雍兵败，还走；

战好畤，又大败，走废丘。

汉王遂定雍地。

东如咸阳，引兵围雍王废丘，而遣诸将略地。

田荣闻羽徙齐王市于胶东而立田都为齐王，大怒，以齐兵迎击田都。

都走降楚。

六月，田荣杀田市，自立为齐王。

时彭越在巨野，众万余人，无所属。

荣与越将军印，因令反梁地。

越击杀济北王安，荣遂并三齐之地。

燕王韩广亦不肯徙辽东。

秋八月，臧荼杀韩广，并其地。

塞王欣、翟王翳皆降汉。

初，项梁立韩后公子成为韩王，张良为韩司徒。

羽以良从汉王，韩王成又无功，故不遣就国，与俱至彭城，杀之。

及闻汉王并关中，而齐、梁畔之，羽大怒，乃以故吴令郑昌为韩王，距汉。

令萧公角击彭越，越败角兵。

时张良徇韩地，遗羽书曰：“汉欲得关中，如约即止，不敢复东。”

羽以故无西意，而北击齐。

九月，汉王遣将军薛欧、王吸出武关，因王陵兵，从南阳迎太公、吕后于沛。

羽闻之，发兵距之阳夏，不得前。

二年冬十月，项羽使九江王布杀义帝于郴。

陈馀亦怨羽独不王己，从田荣借助兵，以击常山王张耳。

耳败走降汉，汉王厚遇之。

陈馀迎代王歇还赵，歇立馀为代王。

张良自韩间行归汉，汉王以为成信侯。

汉王如陕，镇抚关外父老。

蜀、汉民给军事劳苦，复勿租税二岁。

关中卒从军者，复家一岁。

举民年五十以上，有修行，能帅众为善，置以为三老，乡一人。

择乡三老一人为县三老，与县令、丞、尉以事相教，复勿徭戍。

以十月赐酒肉。

三月，汉王自临晋渡河。

魏王豹降，将兵从。

下河内，虏殷王卬，置河内郡。

至脩武，陈平亡楚来降。

汉王与语，说之，使参乘，监诸将。

南渡平阴津，至洛阳，新城三老董公遮说汉王曰：“臣闻‘顺德者昌，逆德者亡’，‘兵出无名，事故不成’。

故曰：‘明其为贼，敌乃可服。’

项羽为无道，放杀其主，天下之贼也。

夫仁不以勇，义不以力，三军之众为之素服，以告之诸侯，为此东伐，四海之内莫不仰德。

此三王之举也。”

汉王曰：“善。非夫子无所闻。”

于是汉王为义帝发丧，袒而大哭，哀临三日。

发使告诸侯曰：“天下共立义帝，北面事之。

今项羽放杀义帝江南，大逆无道。

寡人亲为发丧，兵皆缟素。

悉发关中兵，收三河士，南浮江、汉以下，愿从诸侯王击楚之杀义帝者。”

夏四月，田荣弟横收得数万人，立荣子广为齐王。

羽虽闻汉东，既击齐，欲遂破之而后击汉，汉王以故得劫五诸侯兵东伐楚。

到外黄，彭越将三万人归汉。

汉王拜越为魏相国，令定梁也。

汉王遂入彭城，收羽美人货赂，置酒高会。

羽闻之，令其将击齐，而自以精兵三万人从鲁出胡陵，至萧、晨击汉军，大战彭城灵壁东睢水上，大破汉军，多杀士卒，睢水为之不流。

围汉王三匝。

大风从西北起，折木发屋，扬砂石，昼晦，楚军大乱，而汉王得与数十骑遁去。

过沛，使人求室家，室家亦已亡，不相得。

汉王道逢孝惠、鲁元，载行。

楚骑追汉王，汉王急，推堕二子。

滕公下收载，遂得脱。

审食其从太公、吕后间行，反遇楚军，羽常置军中以为质。

诸侯见汉败，皆亡去。

塞王欣、翟王翳降楚，殷王卬死。

吕后兄周吕侯将兵居下邑，汉王从之。

稍收士卒，军砀。

汉王西过梁地，至虞，谓谒者随何曰：“公能说九江王布使举兵畔楚，项王必留击之。

得留数月，吾取天下必矣。”

随何往说布，果使畔楚。

五月，汉王屯荥阳，萧何发关中老弱未傅者悉诣军。

韩信亦收兵与汉王会，兵复大振。

关中大饥，米斛万钱，人相食。

令民就食蜀、汉。

秋八月，汉王如荥阳，谓郦食其曰：“缓颊往说魏王豹，能下之，以魏地万户封生。”

食其往，豹不听。

汉王以韩信为左丞相，与曹参、灌婴俱击魏。

食其还，汉王问：“魏大将谁也？”

对曰：“柏直。”

王曰：“是口尚乳臭，不能当韩信。

骑将谁也？”

曰：“冯敬。”

曰：“是秦将冯无择子也。虽贤，不能当灌婴。

步卒将谁也？”

曰：“项它。”

曰：“不能当曹参。吾无患矣。”

九月，信等虏豹，传诣荥阳。

定魏地，置河东、太原、上党郡。

信使人请兵三万人，愿以北举燕、赵，东击齐，南绝楚粮道。

汉王与之。

三年冬十月，韩信、张耳东下井陉击赵，斩陈馀，获赵王歇。

置常山、代郡。

甲戌晦，日有食之。

十一月癸卯晦，日有食之。

随何既说黥布，布起兵攻楚。

楚使项声、龙且攻布，布战不胜。

十二月，布与随何间行归汉。

汉王分之兵，与俱收兵至成皋。

项羽数侵夺汉甬道，汉军乏食，与郦食其谋桡楚权。

食其欲立六国后以树党，汉王刻印，将遣食其立之。

以问张良，良发八难。

汉王辍饭吐哺，曰：“竖儒几败乃公事！”

令趋销印。

又问陈平，乃从其计，与平黄金四万斤，以间疏楚君臣。

夏四月，项羽围汉荥阳，汉王请和，割荥阳以西者为汉。

亚父劝项羽急攻荥阳，汉王患之。

陈平反间既行，羽果疑亚父。

亚父大怒而去，发病死。

五月，将军纪信曰：“事急矣！臣请诳楚，可以间出。”

于是陈平夜出女子东门二千余人，楚因四面击之。

纪信乃乘王车，黄屋左纛，曰：“食尽，汉王降楚。”

楚皆呼万岁，之城东观，以故汉王得与数十骑出西门遁。

令御史大夫周苛、魏豹、枞公守荥阳。

羽见纪信，问：“汉王安在？”

曰：“已出去矣。”

羽烧杀信。

而周苛、枞公相谓曰：“反国之王，难与守城。”

因杀魏豹。

汉王出荥阳，至成皋。

自成皋入关，收兵欲复东。

辕生说汉王曰：“汉与楚相距荥阳数岁，汉常困。

愿君王出武关，项王必引兵南走，王深壁，令荥阳、成皋间且得休息。

使韩信等得辑河北赵地，连燕、齐，君王乃复走荥阳。

如此，则楚所备者多，力分。

汉得休息，复与之战，破之必矣。”

汉王从其计，出军宛、叶间，与黥布行收兵。

羽闻汉王在宛，果引兵南，汉王坚壁不与战。

是月，彭越渡睢，与项声、薛公战下邳，破杀薛公。

羽使终公守成皋，而自东击彭越。

汉王引兵北，击破终公，复军成皋。

六月，羽已破走彭越，闻汉复军成皋，乃引兵西拔荥阳城，生得周苛。

羽谓苛：“为我将，以公为上将军，封三万户。”

周苛骂曰：“若不趋降汉，今为虏矣！若非汉王敌也。”

羽亨周苛，并杀枞公，而虏韩王信，遂围成皋。

汉王跳，独与滕公共车出成皋玉门，北渡河，宿小修武。

自称使者，晨驰入张耳、韩信壁而夺之军。

乃使张耳北收兵赵地。

秋七月，有星孛于大角。

汉王得韩信军，复大振。

八月，临河南乡，军小修武，欲复战。

郎中郑忠说止汉王，高垒深堑勿战。

汉王听其计，使卢绾、刘贾将卒二万人，骑数百，渡白马津入楚地，佐彭越烧楚积聚，复击破楚军燕郭西，攻下睢阳、外黄十七城。

九月，羽谓海春侯大司马曹咎曰：“谨守成皋。

即汉王欲挑战，慎勿与战，勿令得东而已。

我十五日必定梁地，复从将军。”

羽引兵东击彭越。

汉王使郦食其说齐王田广，罢守兵与汉和。

四年冬十月，韩信用蒯通计，袭破齐。

齐王亨郦生，东走高密。

项羽闻韩信破齐，且欲击楚，使龙且救齐。

汉果数挑成皋战，楚军不出。

使人辱之数日，大司马咎怒，渡兵汜水。

士卒半渡，汉击之，大破楚军，尽得楚国金玉货赂。

大司马咎、长史欣皆自刭汜水上。

汉王引兵渡河，复取成皋，军广武，就敖仓食。

羽下梁地十余城，闻海春侯破，乃引兵还。

汉军方围钟离眜于荥阳东，闻羽至，尽走险阻。

羽亦军广武，与汉相守。

丁壮苦军旅，老弱罢转饷。

汉王、羽相与临广武之间而语。

羽欲与汉王独身挑战，汉王数羽曰：“吾始与羽俱受命怀王，曰先定关中者王之。

羽负约，王我于蜀、汉，罪一也。

羽矫杀卿子冠军，自尊，罪二也。

羽当以救赵还报，而擅劫诸侯兵入关，罪三也。

怀王约，入秦无暴掠，羽烧秦宫室，掘始皇帝冢，收私其财，罪四也。

又强杀秦降王子婴，罪五也。

诈坑秦子弟新安二十万，王其将，罪六也。

皆王诸将善地，而徙逐故主，令臣下争畔逆，罪七也。

出逐义帝彭城，自都之，夺韩王地，并王梁、楚，多自与，罪八也。

使人阴杀义帝江南，罪九也。

夫为人臣而杀其主，杀其已降，为政不平，主约不信，天下所不容，大逆无道，罪十也。

吾以义兵从诸侯诛残贼，使刑余罪人击公，何苦乃与公挑战！”

羽大怒，伏弩射中汉王。

汉王伤胸，乃扪足曰：“虏中吾指！”

汉王病创卧，张良强请汉王起行劳军，以安士卒，毋令楚乘胜。

汉王出行军，疾甚，因驰入成皋。

十一月，韩信与灌婴击破楚军，杀楚将龙且，追至城阳，虏齐王广。

齐相田横自立为齐王，奔彭越。

汉立张耳为赵王。

汉王疾愈，西入关，至栎阳，存问父老，置酒。

枭故塞王欣头栎阳市。

留四日，复如军，军广武。

关中兵益出，而彭越、田横居梁地，往来苦楚兵，绝其粮食。

韩信已破齐，使人言曰：“齐边楚，权轻，不为假王，恐不能安齐。”

汉王怒，欲攻之。

张良曰：“不如因而立之，使自为守。”

春二月，遣张良操印，立韩信为齐王。

秋七月，立黥布为淮南王。

八月，初为算赋。

北貉、燕人来致枭骑助汉。

汉王下令：军士不幸死者，吏为衣衾棺敛，转送其家。

四方归心焉。

项羽自知少助食尽，韩信又进兵击楚，羽患之。

汉遣陆贾说羽，请太公，羽弗听。

汉复使侯公说羽，羽乃与汉约，中分天下，割鸿沟以西为汉，以东为楚。

九月，归太公、吕后，军皆称万岁。

乃封侯公为平国君。

羽解而东归。

汉王欲西归，张良、陈平谏曰：“今汉有天下太半，而诸侯皆附，楚兵罢食尽，此天亡之时，不因其几而遂取之，此养虎自遗患也。”

汉王从之。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">汉高祖，是沛县丰邑中阳里人，姓刘。

他的母亲刘媪曾在大湖的岸边休息，梦中与神相遇。当时雷电交加，天色昏暗，他的父亲太公前去查看，就看见一条蛟龙趴在她身上。不久之后刘媪就怀孕了，于是生下了高祖。

高祖的相貌，是高鼻梁而额头隆起，有漂亮的胡须，左大腿上有七十二颗黑痣。

他宽厚仁爱，待人诚恳，心胸开阔。常常有远大的志向，不从事普通百姓的生产劳作。

到了壮年，通过试用成为官吏，担任泗上亭长，官府中的官吏没有不被他戏弄耍笑的。

喜好喝酒和女色。常常到王媪、武负的酒肆赊酒，有时喝醉了就躺卧在那里，武负、王媪看到他身上常常有怪异的现象。

高祖每次去买酒留饮，酒的销量都比平时多出几倍。等到发现了他身上的怪异现象，到了年底，这两家常常毁掉债券，免除他的酒债。

高祖曾到咸阳服徭役，得以尽情观看秦始皇，长叹一声说：“唉，大丈夫就应当像这样啊！”

单父县人吕公与沛县县令交好，为了躲避仇人，前往县令那里做客，于是就在沛县安家。

沛县中的豪杰和官吏听说县令有重要的客人，都前往祝贺。

萧何担任主吏，负责接收贺礼，对各位宾客说：“进献的贺礼不满一千钱的，在堂下就坐。”

高祖担任亭长，一向轻视各位官吏，于是假意在名帖上写道“贺钱一万”，实际上没带一文钱。

名帖递进去后，吕公非常吃惊，起身，到门口迎接他。

吕公这个人，喜好给人看相，看到高祖的相貌，就特别敬重他，把他领到堂上首座就坐。

萧何说：“刘季本来就爱说大话，很少办成事情。”

高祖趁机戏弄耍笑各位宾客，就坐在了上首座位，没有丝毫谦让。

酒宴快结束时，吕公趁机用眼神示意坚决挽留高祖。

酒席结束后，高祖留在后面。吕公说：“我年轻时喜好给人看相，看过的人很多，没有谁的相貌比得上你刘季的，希望你刘季保重自己。

我有个亲生女儿，希望能让她做你的妻子，为你打理家务。”

酒宴结束后，吕媪对吕公生气地说：“你当初常常想让这个女儿出人头地，把她嫁给贵人。

沛县县令和你交好，向你求娶女儿你都不答应，为什么擅自胡乱地把她许配给刘季呢？”

吕公说：“这不是妇孺之辈所能明白的。”最终把女儿嫁给了高祖。

吕公的女儿就是后来的吕后，生下了孝惠帝、鲁元公主。

高祖曾请假回到家乡种田。

吕后和两个孩子住在田间，有一位老汉路过，请求喝水，吕后于是给了他食物吃。

老汉为吕后看相说：“夫人是天下的贵人啊。”

让他给两个孩子看相，看到孝惠帝，说：“夫人之所以尊贵，是因为这个男孩。”

给鲁元公主看相，也说她会尊贵。

老汉离开后，高祖恰好从旁边的屋舍过来，吕后详细地告诉他说：“有位客人路过，给我母子看相，说我们都将非常尊贵。”

高祖问老汉在哪里，吕后说：“还没走远。”高祖于是追上去，问老汉。

老汉说：“刚才看夫人和孩子都因为您而尊贵，您的相貌贵不可言。”

高祖于是道谢说：“如果真像您说的那样，我不会忘记您的恩德。”

等到高祖尊贵之后，就不知道老汉在哪里了。

高祖担任亭长时，就用竹皮做帽子，让负责缉捕盗贼的亭卒到薛地去制作，时常戴着它，等到尊贵之后也常常戴着，这就是所说的“刘氏冠”。

高祖以亭长的身份为县里押送刑徒去骊山，刑徒大多在途中逃跑了。

自己估计等到了骊山刑徒就都跑光了，到了丰西的沼泽中的亭舍，停下来饮酒，夜里把所押送的刑徒都放了，说：“你们都走吧，我也从此离开这里了！”

刑徒中愿意跟随他的壮士有十多人。

高祖带着酒意，夜里从小路走进沼泽，让一个人在前面探路。

探路的人回来报告说：“前面有一条大蛇挡住了路，希望回去。”

高祖醉醺醺地说：“壮士走路，有什么可怕的！”于是上前，拔剑斩断了蛇。

蛇被分成两段，道路通了。

走了几里路，高祖因醉酒困倦而躺下睡着了。

后面的人来到斩蛇的地方，有一个老妇人在夜里哭泣。

有人问老妇人为什么哭，老妇人说：“有人杀了我的儿子。”

有人说：“您的儿子为什么被杀死？”

老妇人说：“我的儿子，是白帝的儿子，变成蛇挡在路上，现在被赤帝的儿子斩杀了，所以我哭。”

人们于是认为老妇人不诚实，想让她受苦，老妇人却忽然不见了。

后面的人赶到，高祖醒了。把这件事告诉了高祖，高祖心里暗自高兴，很是自负。

那些跟随他的人一天比一天敬畏他。

秦始皇曾经说“东南方向有天子气”，于是向东巡游来镇压它。

高祖隐藏在芒山、砀山的山泽之间，吕后和别人一起去找他，常常能找到。

高祖奇怪地问吕后原因，吕后说：“你居住的地方上面常常有云气，所以跟着云气走常常能找到你。”

高祖又很高兴。沛县中的年轻人有的听说了这件事，大多想归附他。

秦二世元年秋季七月，陈涉在蕲县起义。

到了陈县，自立为楚王，派遣武臣、张耳、陈馀攻占赵地。

八月，武臣自立为赵王。

各郡县大多杀死长官来响应陈涉。

九月，沛县县令想率领沛县百姓响应陈涉。

县掾、主吏萧何、曹参说：“您是秦朝的官吏，现在想背叛秦朝，率领沛县的年轻人，恐怕他们不会听从。

希望您召集那些逃亡在外的人，能得到几百人，趁机胁迫众人，众人就不敢不听从了。”

于是命令樊哙去召高祖。

高祖的部众已经有几百人了。

于是樊哙跟随高祖前来。

沛县县令后悔了，害怕他们有变故，于是关闭城门防守，想要诛杀萧何、曹参。

萧何、曹参害怕了，翻越城墙去投靠高祖。

高祖于是在帛上写信射到城上，给沛县的父老说：

“天下人受秦朝的苦已经很久了。现在父老们虽然为沛县县令守城，但是诸侯一同起兵，将要屠戮沛县。

沛县现在一起杀掉县令，选择可以拥立的人拥立他，来响应诸侯，就能保全家族。

不这样做，父子都会被屠杀，没什么意义。”

父老们于是率领年轻人一起杀掉沛县县令，打开城门迎接高祖，想让他做沛县县令。

高祖说：“天下正动荡不安，诸侯一同起兵，现在如果安排的将领不合适，就会一败涂地。

我不是敢爱惜自己，担心能力浅薄，不能保全父老乡亲、兄弟子侄。

这是大事，希望重新选择合适的人。”

萧何、曹参都是文官，爱惜自己，担心事情不能成功，日后秦朝会诛灭他们的家族，都推让给高祖。

众父老都说：“平时听说的刘季的奇异之事，预示他应当显贵，而且占卜的结果，没有谁比刘季更吉利。”

高祖多次推让，众人没有谁愿意担任，高祖于是被拥立为沛公。

在沛县的公廷祭祀黄帝、蚩尤，并用牲畜的血涂在鼓和旗帜上举行祭祀仪式。

旗帜都为红色，是因为所杀的蛇是白帝的儿子，而斩杀蛇的人是赤帝的儿子的缘故。

于是年轻的豪杰官吏如萧何、曹参、樊哙等人都去招收沛县的年轻人，得到三千人。

这个月，项梁和他哥哥的儿子项羽在吴地起兵。

田儋和堂弟田荣、田横在齐地起兵，田儋自立为齐王。

韩广自立为燕王。

魏咎自立为魏王。

陈涉的将领周章向西进入函谷关，到达戏地，秦将章邯迎击并打败了他。

秦二世二年十月，沛公攻打胡陵、方与，返回驻守丰邑。

秦泗川监平率领军队包围丰邑。

两天后，出兵和他交战，打败了他。

命令雍齿驻守丰邑。

十一月，沛公率领军队前往薛地。

秦泗川守壮的军队在薛地被打败，逃到戚地，沛公的左司马俘获并杀死了他。

沛公回师亢父，到达方与。

赵王武臣被他的将领杀死。

十二月，楚王陈涉被他的车夫杀死。

魏人周巿攻占丰邑、沛县一带，派人对雍齿说：“丰邑，是过去梁国迁徙的地方。

现在魏地已经平定的有几十座城，你现在投降魏国，魏国将封你为侯驻守丰邑；不投降，将要屠戮丰邑。”

雍齿向来不愿意归属沛公，等到魏国招降他，就反叛为魏国驻守丰邑。

沛公攻打丰邑，没能攻下。

沛公返回沛县，怨恨雍齿和丰邑的年轻人背叛他。

正月，张耳等人拥立赵国的后代赵歇为赵王。

东阳甯君、秦嘉拥立景驹为楚王，驻守在留地。

沛公前去投奔他，在路上遇到张良，于是和他一起去见景驹，请求派兵来攻打丰邑。

当时章邯追击陈涉的军队，另一位将领司马卬率领军队向北平定楚地，屠戮相县，到达砀县。

东阳甯君、沛公率领军队向西，和司马卬的军队在萧县西边交战，不顺利，返回收兵聚集在留地。

二月，攻打砀县，三天后攻下了它。

收编砀县的军队，得到六千人，和原来的士兵合起来共九千人。

三月，攻打下方邑，攻下了它。

回师攻打丰邑，没能攻下。

四月，项梁击杀景驹、秦嘉，驻守在薛地，沛公前去拜见他。

项梁增拨给沛公士兵五千人，五大夫级别的将领十人。

沛公返回，率领军队攻打丰邑，攻下了它。

雍齿逃到魏国。

五月，项羽攻下襄城返回。

项梁把各路将领都召集来。

六月，沛公到薛地，和项梁一起拥立楚怀王的孙子芈心为楚怀王。

章邯在临济打败并杀死魏王咎、齐王田儋。

七月，连续下大雨。

沛公攻打亢父。

章邯在东阿包围田荣。

沛公和项梁一起救援田荣，在东阿大败章邯。

田荣返回，沛公、项羽追击败兵，到达城阳，攻打并屠戮了城阳。

驻军在濮阳东边，再次和章邯交战，又打败了他。

章邯重新振作，驻守濮阳，围绕城池挖沟引水。

沛公、项羽离开去攻打定陶。

八月，田荣拥立田儋的儿子田市为齐王。

定陶没有攻下，沛公和项羽向西攻占土地到雍丘，和秦军交战，大败秦军，斩杀三川守李由。

回师攻打外黄，外黄没有攻下。

项梁再次打败秦军，有了骄傲的神色。

宋义劝谏，项梁不听。

秦朝给章邯增派军队。

九月，章邯在夜里让士兵衔枚偷袭驻守在定陶的项梁，大败项梁的军队，杀死项梁。

当时连续下雨从七月到九月。

沛公、项羽正在攻打陈留，听说项梁死了，士兵们很害怕，于是和将军吕臣率领军队向东，把怀王从盱台迁移到彭城定都。

吕臣的军队驻扎在彭城东面，项羽的军队驻扎在彭城西面，沛公的军队驻扎在砀县。

魏咎的弟弟魏豹自立为魏王。

闰九月，怀王合并吕臣、项羽的军队亲自率领。

任命沛公为砀郡长，封武安侯，率领砀郡的军队。

任命项羽为鲁公，封长安侯。

吕臣为司徒，他的父亲吕青为令尹。

章邯已经打败项梁，认为楚地的军队不值得担忧，于是渡过黄河向北攻打赵王歇，大败赵王歇。

赵王歇退守巨鹿城，秦将王离包围了他。

赵国多次请求救援，怀王于是任命宋义为上将军，项羽为次将，范增为末将，向北救援赵国。

当初，怀王和众将领约定，先进入并平定关中的人封他为王。

在那个时候，秦军强大，常常乘胜追击溃败的军队，众将领没有谁认为先入关有利。

只有项羽怨恨秦军打败项梁，情绪激昂，愿意和沛公向西进入函谷关。

怀王的众老将都说：“项羽为人勇猛凶狠，曾经攻打襄城，襄城没有活下来的人，所经过的地方没有不被摧残毁灭的。

况且楚军多次进军夺取土地，先前陈王、项梁都失败了，不如改派一位宽厚的长者秉持正义向西进军，告知秦地的父老兄弟。

秦地的父老兄弟受他们君主的苦已经很久了，现在如果真能派宽厚的长者前往，不侵犯暴虐，应该可以攻下秦地。

项羽不能派遣，只有沛公一向是宽厚的长者。”

最终没有答应项羽，而是派遣沛公向西收编陈王、项梁的散兵。

于是取道砀县到城阳和杠里，攻打秦军的营垒，打败了秦军的两支军队。

秦二世三年十月，齐将田都背叛田荣，率领军队帮助项羽救援赵国。

沛公在成武打败了东郡尉的军队。

十一月，项羽杀死宋义，兼并了他的军队渡过黄河，自立为上将军，众将领如黥布等人都归属他。

十二月，沛公率领军队到达栗县，遇到刚武侯，夺取了他的军队四千多人，把这些人合并到自己的军队中，和魏将皇欣、武满的军队联合攻打秦军，打败了秦军。

前齐王田建的孙子田安攻下济北，跟从项羽救援赵国。

项羽在巨鹿城下大败秦军，俘虏了王离，赶跑了章邯。

二月，沛公从砀县向北攻打昌邑，遇到彭越。

彭越协助攻打昌邑，没有攻下。

沛公向西经过高阳，郦食其是里门的守门人，说：“众将领经过这里的很多，我看沛公是个度量大的人。”

于是请求拜见沛公。

沛公正坐在床上，让两个女子给他洗脚。

郦生不行拜礼，行长揖之礼说：“您如果一定要诛灭无道的秦朝，不应该坐着接见长者。”

于是沛公起身，整理衣服向他道歉，请他坐上座。

郦食其劝说沛公袭击陈留。

沛公任命郦食其为广野君，任命他的弟弟郦商为将军，率领陈留的军队。

三月，攻打开封，没有攻下。

向西和秦将杨熊在白马交战，又在曲遇的东面交战，大败杨熊的军队。

杨熊逃到荥阳，秦二世派使者斩杀了他并巡行示众。

四月，向南攻打颍川，屠戮了颍川城。

凭借张良的帮助于是夺取了韩地。

当时赵国的别将司马卬正要渡过黄河进入函谷关，沛公于是向北攻打平阴，断绝了黄河的渡口。

向南进军，在洛阳东面交战，军队失利，从轘辕关到阳城，收集军中的马匹和骑兵。

六月，和南阳守齮在犨县东面交战，打败了他。

夺取南阳郡，南阳守逃走，坚守宛城。

沛公率领军队经过宛城的西面。

张良劝谏说：“沛公虽然想急于进入函谷关，但秦军还很多，占据着险要的地势。

现在不攻下宛城，宛城的军队从后面进攻，强大的秦军在前面，这是危险的做法。”

于是沛公就在夜里率领军队从别的道路返回，放倒旗帜，天快亮的时候，把宛城包围了三层。

南阳守想要自刎，他的门客陈恢说：“现在死还不晚。”

于是翻越城墙去见沛公，说：“我听说您约定先进入咸阳的人封他为王，现在您留下来攻打宛城。

宛城所属的县邑相连有几十座，那里的官吏百姓自认为投降必定会死，所以都登上城墙坚守。

现在您整天不停地攻打，士兵伤亡必定很多；率领军队离开，宛城的军队必定会跟随您。

向前就会失去先入咸阳的约定，向后又有强大的宛城军队的祸患。

替您谋划，不如约定投降，封南阳守为侯，趁机让他留下来守城，率领他的士兵和您一起向西进军。

那些还没有攻下的城邑，听到这个消息会争相打开城门来等待您，您通行就没有阻碍了。”

沛公说：“好。”

七月，南阳守齮投降，被封为殷侯，封陈恢为千户侯。

率领军队向西进军，没有攻不下的城邑。

到达丹水，高武侯鳃、襄侯王陵投降。

回师攻打胡阳，遇到番君的别将梅鋗，和他一起攻打析县、郦县，两地都投降了。

所经过的地方不得掳掠，秦地的百姓很高兴。

派遣魏人甯昌出使秦国。

这个月，章邯率领全军投降项羽，项羽封他为雍王。

瑕丘人申阳攻下河南。

八月，沛公攻打武关，进入秦地。

秦丞相赵高害怕，就杀死秦二世，派人来，想约定分割关中称王，沛公不答应。

九月，赵高拥立秦二世兄长的儿子子婴为秦王。

子婴诛杀了赵高，派遣将领率军把守峣关。

沛公想要攻打峣关，张良说：“秦军还很强大，不可轻视。

希望先派人在山上多插旗帜作为疑兵，派郦食其、陆贾前去劝说秦将，用利益引诱他们。”

秦将果然想联合讲和，沛公想答应他们。

张良说：“这只是秦将想反叛，恐怕他们的士兵不听从，不如趁他们懈怠时攻打他们。”

沛公率领军队绕过峣关，翻越蒉山，攻打秦军，在蓝田南面大败秦军。

于是到达蓝田，又在蓝田北面交战，秦军大败。

汉高祖元年冬十月，五颗行星汇聚在东井星宿。

沛公到达霸上。

秦王子婴乘坐素车白马，用丝绳系着脖子，封好皇帝的玉玺、符节，在枳道旁投降。

众将领中有人建议诛杀秦王，沛公说：“当初怀王派遣我，本是因为我能宽容，况且人家已经投降，杀死他不吉利。”

于是把秦王交给官吏看管。

于是向西进入咸阳。

沛公想留在秦宫中休息，樊哙、张良劝谏，于是封存了秦朝的珍宝财物府库，回军驻守霸上。

萧何全部收集了秦丞相府的地图、户籍和文书。

十一月，沛公召集各县的豪杰说：“父老们受秦朝苛酷法令的苦已经很久了，非议朝政的人灭族，相聚交谈的人处死于闹市。

我和诸侯约定，先进入函谷关的人称王，我应当在关中称王。

我和父老们约定三条法令：杀人的人处死，伤害人以及偷盗的人按罪惩处。

其余的秦朝法令全部废除。

官吏百姓都像原来一样安定不动。

我之所以来到这里，是为父老们除害，不是要侵犯暴虐你们，不要害怕！

况且我驻军霸上的原因，是等待诸侯到来后制定约束条款罢了。”

于是派人和秦朝的官吏一起到各县、乡、邑宣告晓谕百姓。

秦地百姓非常高兴，争相拿着牛、羊、酒食来犒劳士兵。

沛公推辞不接受，说：“仓库里的粮食很多，不想耗费百姓的财物。”

百姓更加高兴，唯恐沛公不做秦王。

有人劝说沛公说：“秦地的财富是天下的十倍，地形险要。

现在听说章邯投降了项羽，项羽封他为雍王，统治关中。

如果他来了，沛公恐怕不能拥有这里。

可以赶紧派兵把守函谷关，不让诸侯的军队进入，逐渐征集关中的士兵来增强自己的实力，抵御他们。”

沛公认为他的计策正确，听从了他。

十二月，项羽果然率领诸侯的军队想向西进入函谷关，关门紧闭。

听说沛公已经平定关中，项羽大怒，派黥布等人攻破函谷关，于是到达戏下。

沛公的左司马曹毋伤听说项羽发怒，想攻打沛公，派人对项羽说：“沛公想在关中称王，让子婴做丞相，珍宝全都占有了。”

想借此求得封赏。

亚父范增劝说项羽道：“沛公在山东的时候，贪图财物，喜好女色。

现在听说他进入函谷关后，不掠取珍宝，不亲近妇女，这说明他的志向不小。

我派人观察他的云气，都是龙的形状，呈现五种颜色，这是天子的云气。

赶紧攻打他，不要失去机会。”

于是犒劳士兵，准备第二天交战。

这时，项羽的军队有四十万，号称一百万。

沛公的军队有十万，号称二十万，兵力不能匹敌。

适逢项羽的叔父左尹项伯一向和张良交好，连夜骑马去见张良，把实情全部告诉了他，想和他一起离开，不要白白一起送死。

张良说：“我为韩王护送沛公，不能不告诉他，逃走是不义的。”

于是和项伯一起去见沛公。

沛公和项伯约定结为儿女亲家，说：“我进入函谷关后，丝毫不敢掠取，登记官吏百姓，封存府库，等待将军到来。

之所以把守函谷关，是为了防备其他盗贼。

日夜盼望将军到来，怎么敢反叛呢！

希望您明确告诉将军我不敢违背恩德。”

项伯答应了，当夜回去，告诫沛公说：“明天不可不早点亲自来道歉。”

项伯回去后，把沛公的话全部告诉了项羽，趁机说：“沛公不先打败关中的秦军，您怎么能进入关中呢？

况且人家有大功，攻打他不吉利，不如趁机善待他。”

项羽答应了。

沛公第二天带领一百多骑兵到鸿门拜见项羽，道歉说：“我和将军合力攻打秦朝，将军在黄河以北作战，我在黄河以南作战，没料到能先进入函谷关，打败秦朝，能和将军再次相见。

现在有小人进言，让将军和我产生隔阂。”

项羽说：“这是沛公的左司马曹毋伤说的，否则，我怎么会到这种地步？”

项羽于是挽留沛公饮酒。

范增多次向项羽使眼色要他攻打沛公，项羽没有回应。

范增起身，出去对项庄说：“君王为人不忍心，你进去用剑起舞，趁机攻打沛公，杀掉他。

不这样做，你们这些人将要被他俘虏。”

项庄进去敬酒祝寿。

敬酒完毕，说：“军中没有什么娱乐，请允许我用剑起舞。”

于是拔出剑起舞。

项伯也起身起舞，常常用身体像鸟张开翅膀一样掩护沛公。

樊哙听说事情紧急，径直闯入，非常愤怒。

项羽赞赏他的勇武，赐给他酒。

樊哙趁机责备项羽。

过了一会儿，沛公起身去厕所，招呼樊哙出去，留下车马和随从官员，独自骑马，樊哙、靳强、滕公、纪成步行，从小路回到军营，派张良留下来向项羽道歉。

项羽问：“沛公在哪里？”

张良说：“听说将军有意责备他，他脱身离开，从小路回到军营，所以派我献上玉璧。”

项羽接受了玉璧。

又向范增献上玉斗。

范增发怒，撞碎玉斗，起身说：“我们这些人现在要被沛公俘虏了！”

沛公回去几天后，项羽率领军队向西屠戮咸阳，杀死投降的秦王子婴，烧毁秦朝的宫殿，所经过的地方都被摧残毁灭，秦地百姓非常失望。

项羽派人回去报告怀王，怀王说：“按照约定办。”

项羽怨恨怀王不肯让自己和沛公一起向西进入函谷关而派自己向北救援赵国，耽误了天下的约定。

于是说：“怀王，是我家拥立的罢了，没有功劳，凭什么能独自主持约定！

本来平定天下，是众将领和我（项籍）的功劳。”

春正月，表面上尊怀王为义帝，实际上不听从他的命令。

二月，项羽自立为西楚霸王，统治梁、楚地区的九个郡，定都彭城。

违背约定，改立沛公为汉王，统治巴、蜀、汉中四十一个县，定都南郑。

把关中分为三部分，封秦朝的三个降将为王，章邯为雍王，定都废丘；

司马欣为塞王，定都栎阳；董翳为翟王，定都高奴。

楚将瑕丘人申阳为河南王，定都洛阳。

赵将司马卬为殷王，定都朝歌。

当阳君英布为九江王，定都六县。

怀王的柱国共敖为临江王，定都江陵。

番君吴芮为衡山王，定都邾县。

前齐王田建的孙子田安为济北王。

改封魏王豹为西魏王，定都平阳。

改封燕王韩广为辽东王。

燕将臧荼为燕王，定都蓟县。

改封齐王田市为胶东王。

齐将田都为齐王，定都临菑。

改封赵王歇为代王。

赵相张耳为常山王。

汉王怨恨项羽违背约定，想攻打他，丞相萧何劝谏，才停止。

夏四月，诸侯在戏下罢兵，各自前往自己的封国。

项羽派三万士兵跟随汉王，楚地人和诸侯中仰慕汉王而跟随的有几万人，从杜县南面进入蚀中。

张良告辞返回韩国，汉王送他到褒中，趁机劝说汉王烧毁栈道，来防备诸侯的偷袭军队，也向项羽表示没有向东进兵的意图。

汉王到达南郑后，众将领和士兵都唱歌思念向东回到故乡，很多人在途中逃跑回去了。

韩信担任治粟都尉，也逃跑了。

萧何追赶并追回了他，趁机向汉王推荐说：“如果一定要争夺天下，除了韩信没有可以和他商议大事的人。”

于是汉王斋戒，设置坛场，任命韩信为大将军，向他询问计策。

韩信回答说：“项羽违背约定而封大王在南郑为王，这是流放。

官兵都是崤山以东的人，日夜盼望回去，趁他们的锐气使用他们，可以建立大功。

天下平定后，百姓都各自安宁，就不能再利用了。

不如决定向东进兵。”

趁机陈述可以谋取项羽、容易兼并三秦的计策。

汉王非常高兴，于是听从韩信的计策，部署众将领。

留下萧何征收巴、蜀的租税，供给军队粮食。

五月，汉王率领军队从故道出兵袭击雍地。

雍王章邯在陈仓迎击汉军，雍军失败，往回逃跑；

在好畤交战，又大败，逃到废丘。

汉王于是平定了雍地。

向东到达咸阳，率领军队包围雍王所在的废丘，同时派遣众将领攻占土地。

田荣听说项羽把齐王田市迁移到胶东而封田都为齐王，非常愤怒，率领齐军迎击田都。

田都逃跑投降楚国。

六月，田荣杀死田市，自立为齐王。

当时彭越在巨野，有部众一万多人，没有归属。

田荣授予彭越将军印，趁机命令他在梁地反叛。

彭越击杀济北王田安，田荣于是兼并了三齐的土地。

燕王韩广也不肯迁移到辽东。

秋八月，臧荼杀死韩广，兼并了他的封地。

塞王司马欣、翟王董翳都投降了汉王。

当初，项梁拥立韩国后代公子成为韩王，张良为韩国司徒。

项羽因为张良跟随汉王，韩王成又没有功劳，所以不让他前往封国，带着他一起到彭城，杀了他。

等到听说汉王兼并了关中，而齐、梁两地反叛自己，项羽大怒，于是任命前吴县令郑昌为韩王，抵御汉王。

命令萧公角攻打彭越，彭越打败了萧公角的军队。

当时张良在韩地巡行，给项羽送信说：“汉王想得到关中，按照约定就会停止，不敢再向东进兵。”

项羽因此没有向西进兵的打算，而是向北攻打齐国。

九月，汉王派遣将军薛欧、王吸出武关，凭借王陵的军队，从南阳到沛县迎接太公、吕后。

项羽听说这件事，派兵在阳夏抵御他们，使他们不能前进。

汉高祖二年冬十月，项羽派九江王英布在郴县杀死义帝。

陈馀也怨恨项羽唯独不封自己为王，向田荣借兵，来攻打常山王张耳。

张耳战败逃跑投降汉王，汉王优厚地对待他。

陈馀迎接代王赵歇返回赵国，赵歇立陈馀为代王。

张良从韩国秘密地回到汉王身边，汉王任命他为成信侯。

汉王到陕县，安抚关外的父老。

河南王申阳投降，设置河南郡。

派遣韩国太尉韩信攻打韩国，韩王郑昌投降。

十一月，立韩国太尉韩信为韩王。

汉王返回，定都栎阳，派遣众将领攻占土地，攻下陇西。

带领一万人或者一个郡投降的，封万户侯。

修缮黄河岸边的要塞。

原来秦朝的苑囿园池，命令百姓可以耕种。

春正月，项羽在城阳攻打田荣，田荣战败逃到平原，平原百姓杀死了他。

齐地人都投降楚国，楚国焚烧了他们的城郭，齐地人又反叛楚国。

众将领攻下北地，俘虏了雍王的弟弟章平。

赦免罪人。

二月癸未日，命令百姓废除秦朝的社稷，建立汉朝的社稷。

施加恩德，赏赐百姓爵位。

蜀、汉地区百姓因供给军事而劳苦，免除两年租税。

关中士兵参军的，免除其家一年徭役赋税。

选拔百姓中年龄五十以上，有德行，能带领众人做好事的人，设置为三老，每乡一人。

选择乡三老中的一人为县三老，和县令、县丞、县尉共同处理政事，免除他们的徭役和戍边任务。

在十月赏赐酒肉。

三月，汉王从临晋渡过黄河。

魏王豹投降，率领军队跟随汉王。

攻下河内，俘虏殷王卬，设置河内郡。

到达脩武，陈平从楚国逃出前来投降。

汉王和他交谈，很欣赏他，让他担任参乘，监督众将领。

向南渡过平阴津，到达洛阳，新城三老董公拦住汉王劝说道：“我听说‘顺应道德的人昌盛，违背道德的人灭亡’，‘出兵没有正当名义，事情就不能成功’。

所以说：‘明确对方是贼寇，敌人才能被降服。’

项羽做无道的事，放逐并杀害他的君主，是天下的贼寇。

施行仁政不用依靠勇武，坚守道义不用依靠武力，三军将士为义帝穿上素服，把这件事告知诸侯，为此向东讨伐，天下没有不敬仰您的德行的。

这是三王的做法。”

汉王说：“好。不是先生我就听不到这些话。”

于是汉王为义帝举办丧事，袒露左臂大哭，哀悼了三天。

派遣使者告诉诸侯说：“天下共同拥立义帝，面向北侍奉他。

现在项羽放逐并杀害义帝在江南，大逆无道。

我亲自为义帝举办丧事，士兵都穿白色丧服。

发动全部关中军队，收聚三河士兵，向南沿长江、汉水而下，希望跟随诸侯王攻打楚国那个杀害义帝的人。”

夏四月，田荣的弟弟田横收聚几万人，立田荣的儿子田广为齐王。

项羽虽然听说汉王向东进兵，但已经在攻打齐国，想趁机打败齐国后再攻打汉王，汉王因此能够胁迫五诸侯的军队向东讨伐楚国。

到达外黄，彭越率领三万人归附汉王。

汉王任命彭越为魏相国，命令他平定梁地。

汉王于是进入彭城，收取了项羽的美女和财物，设置酒宴大宴宾客。

项羽听说这件事，命令他的将领攻打齐国，而自己率领三万精兵从鲁地出发经过胡陵，到达萧县，在清晨攻打汉军，在彭城灵壁东面的睢水上大战，大败汉军，杀死很多士兵，睢水因为尸体堵塞而不能流动。

把汉王包围了三层。

大风从西北刮起，吹断树木，掀翻房屋，扬起沙石，白天变得昏暗，楚军大乱，而汉王能够和几十名骑兵逃走。

经过沛县，派人寻找家属，家属也已经逃亡，没有找到。

汉王在路上遇到孝惠帝、鲁元公主，让他们上车同行。

楚国的骑兵追赶汉王，汉王情况紧急，把两个孩子推下车。

滕公下车把他们收上车，于是得以逃脱。

审食其跟随太公、吕后从小路行走，反而遇到楚军，项羽把他们常常安置在军中作为人质。

诸侯看到汉军失败，都逃走了。

塞王司马欣、翟王董翳投降楚国，殷王卬死去。

吕后的哥哥周吕侯率领军队驻扎在下邑，汉王前往投奔他。

逐渐收聚士兵，驻军在砀县。

汉王向西经过梁地，到达虞县，对谒者随何说：“您能劝说九江王英布让他起兵反叛楚国，项王必定会留下来攻打他。

能停留几个月，我夺取天下就必定无疑了。”

随何前往劝说英布，果然让他反叛楚国。

五月，汉王驻扎在荥阳，萧何征发关中老弱和没有登记服役的人全部到军队中。

韩信也收聚士兵和汉王会合，军队又大大振作起来。

和楚军在荥阳南面的京、索之间交战，打败了楚军。

修筑甬道连接黄河，来取得敖仓的粮食。

魏王豹请求回去探望亲人的疾病。

到了魏国就断绝了黄河渡口，反叛汉王归附楚国。

六月，汉王返回栎阳。

壬午日，立太子，赦免罪人。

命令在关中的诸侯子弟都聚集到栎阳担任警卫。

引水淹灌废丘，废丘投降，章邯自杀。

雍地平定，有八十多个县，设置河上、渭南、中地、陇西、上郡。

命令祠官祭祀天地、四方、上帝、山川，按时祭祀它们。

征发关中士兵驻守边塞。

关中发生大饥荒，一斛米价值一万钱，出现人吃人的现象。

命令百姓到蜀、汉地区谋生。

秋八月，汉王到荥阳，对郦食其说：“婉言劝说魏王豹，能使他投降，把魏地万户封给您。”

郦食其前往，魏豹不听从。

汉王任命韩信为左丞相，和曹参、灌婴一起攻打魏国。

郦食其返回，汉王问：“魏国的大将是谁？”

郦食其回答说：“是柏直。”

汉王说：“这个人乳臭未干，不能抵挡韩信。

骑兵将领是谁？”

郦食其说：“是冯敬。”

汉王说：“这是秦将冯无择的儿子。虽然有才能，不能抵挡灌婴。

步兵将领是谁？”

郦食其说：“是项它。”

汉王说：“不能抵挡曹参。我没有忧虑了。”

九月，韩信等人俘虏魏豹，用驿车送到荥阳。

平定魏地，设置河东、太原、上党郡。

韩信派人请求三万士兵，希望向北攻取燕、赵，向东攻打齐，向南断绝楚国的粮道。

汉王给了他。

汉高祖三年冬十月，韩信、张耳向东攻下井陉攻打赵国，斩杀陈馀，俘获赵王歇。

设置常山、代郡。

甲戌日是月末，发生日食。

十一月癸卯日是月末，发生日食。

随何已经劝说黥布，黥布起兵攻打楚国。

楚国派遣项声、龙且攻打黥布，黥布交战不能取胜。

十二月，黥布和随何从小路回到汉王身边。

汉王分给他军队，和他一起收聚士兵到成皋。

项羽多次侵袭夺取汉军的甬道，汉军缺乏粮食，汉王和郦食其谋划削弱楚国的权势。

郦食其想拥立六国的后代来树立党羽，汉王刻了印，将要派遣郦食其去拥立他们。

拿这件事询问张良，张良提出八点反对意见。

汉王停止吃饭，吐出嘴里的食物，说：“这个书呆子几乎败坏了你的大事！”

命令赶快销毁印信。

又询问陈平，于是听从了他的计策，给陈平四万斤黄金，用来离间楚国的君臣。

夏四月，项羽包围汉王在荥阳，汉王请求讲和，割让荥阳以西的土地给汉。

亚父劝说项羽加紧攻打荥阳，汉王对此感到忧虑。

陈平的离间计已经施行，项羽果然怀疑亚父。

亚父非常愤怒地离开，生病死去。

五月，将军纪信说：“事情紧急了！我请求欺骗楚国，可以趁机逃出。”

于是陈平在夜里从东门放出二千多个女子，楚军于是从四面攻打她们。

纪信于是乘坐汉王的车，车上有黄盖和左边的大旗，说：“粮食耗尽，汉王向楚国投降。”

楚军都呼喊万岁，到城东观看，因此汉王能够和几十名骑兵从西门逃走。

命令御史大夫周苛、魏豹、枞公守卫荥阳。

项羽见到纪信，问：“汉王在哪里？”

纪信说：“已经出去了。”

项羽烧死了纪信。

而周苛、枞公相互商量说：“反叛国家的王，难以和他一起守城。”

于是杀死了魏豹。

汉王逃出荥阳，到达成皋。

从成皋进入函谷关，收聚士兵想再次向东进兵。

辕生劝说汉王说：“汉和楚在荥阳相持好几年，汉军常常处于困境。

希望君王出兵武关，项王必定会率领军队向南行进，君王深挖壕沟高筑壁垒，让荥阳、成皋之间的军队暂且能够休息。

使韩信等人能够安抚河北赵地，联合燕、齐，君王再返回荥阳。

像这样，那么楚国需要防备的地方就多了，力量就会分散。

汉军得到休息，再和楚军交战，必定能打败他们。”

汉王听从了他的计策，出兵到宛县、叶县之间，和黥布一边行进一边收聚士兵。

项羽听说汉王在宛县，果然率领军队向南，汉王坚守壁垒不与他交战。

这个月，彭越渡过睢水，和项声、薛公在下邳交战，打败并杀死了薛公。

项羽派终公守卫成皋，而自己向东攻打彭越。

汉王率领军队向北，打败了终公，再次驻军成皋。

六月，项羽已经打败并赶走了彭越，听说汉军再次驻军成皋，于是率领军队向西攻下荥阳城，活捉了周苛。

项羽对周苛说：“做我的将领，任命您为上将军，封三万户。”

周苛骂道：“你不赶快投降汉王，现在就要成为俘虏了！你不是汉王的对手。”

项羽煮死了周苛，同时杀死了枞公，俘虏了韩王信，于是包围了成皋。

汉王突围，独自和滕公同乘一车从成皋玉门逃出，向北渡过黄河，住宿在小修武。

自称是使者，清晨骑马进入张耳、韩信的营垒并夺取了他们的军队。

于是派张耳向北到赵地收聚士兵。

秋七月，有彗星出现在大角星旁。

汉王得到韩信的军队，士气再次大振。

八月，来到黄河南岸，驻军小修武，想再次交战。

郎中郑忠劝说阻止汉王，要他高筑壁垒深挖壕沟不交战。

汉王听从了他的计策，派卢绾、刘贾率领士兵二万人，骑兵几百人，渡过白马津进入楚地，辅助彭越烧毁楚国的粮草物资，又在燕城以西打败楚军，攻下睢阳、外黄等十七座城。

九月，项羽对海春侯大司马曹咎说：“谨慎守卫成皋。

即使汉王想挑战，千万不要和他交战，只不要让他得以向东进兵罢了。

我十五天内必定平定梁地，再回来和将军会合。”

项羽率领军队向东攻打彭越。

汉王派郦食其劝说齐王田广，让他解除守军和汉讲和。

汉高祖四年冬十月，韩信采用蒯通的计策，偷袭打败了齐国。

齐王煮死了郦食其，向东逃到高密。

项羽听说韩信打败齐国，并且想攻打楚国，派龙且救援齐国。

汉军果然多次挑战成皋的楚军，楚军不出战。

派人辱骂他们好几天，大司马曹咎发怒，派兵渡过汜水。

士兵渡到一半，汉军攻打他们，大败楚军，缴获了楚国全部的金玉财物。

大司马曹咎、长史司马欣都在汜水上自刎。

汉王率领军队渡过黄河，再次攻取成皋，驻军广武，依靠敖仓的粮食供给。

项羽攻下梁地十多座城，听说海春侯被打败，于是率领军队返回。

汉军正在荥阳东面包围钟离眜，听说项羽到了，都逃到险要的地方。

项羽也驻军广武，和汉军相互对峙。

壮年男子苦于行军作战，老弱之人疲于转运粮饷。

汉王、项羽一起到广武涧边交谈。

项羽想和汉王单独挑战，汉王数落项羽说：“我当初和你一起接受怀王的命令，说先平定关中的人封他为王。

你违背约定，封我在蜀、汉为王，这是第一条罪。

你假托命令杀死卿子冠军，自抬身价，这是第二条罪。

你应当在救援赵国后回报怀王，却擅自胁迫诸侯军队进入函谷关，这是第三条罪。

怀王约定，进入秦地不得暴虐掠夺，你烧毁秦朝宫殿，挖掘始皇帝的坟墓，收取财物归为己有，这是第四条罪。

又强行杀死投降的秦王子婴，这是第五条罪。

用欺诈手段在新安活埋二十万秦地子弟，却封他们的将领为王，这是第六条罪。

把好的土地都封给众将领，却迁移驱逐原来的君主，使臣下争相反叛，这是第七条罪。

把义帝赶出彭城，自己在那里定都，夺取韩王的土地，合并梁、楚称王，多给自己封地，这是第八条罪。

派人在江南秘密杀死义帝，这是第九条罪。

作为臣子却杀死君主，杀死已经投降的人，处理政事不公平，主持约定不守信义，为天下所不容，大逆无道，这是第十条罪。

我率领正义之师跟随诸侯诛杀残暴的贼人，派受过刑的罪犯攻打你就够了，何必还要和你挑战呢！”

项羽大怒，埋伏的弓箭手射中了汉王。

汉王胸部受伤，却摸着脚说：“这贼射中了我的脚趾！”

汉王因箭伤卧床，张良坚决请求汉王起身去慰劳军队，来安定士兵，不让楚军乘胜进攻。

汉王出去巡视军队，病情加重，于是驱车进入成皋。

十一月，韩信和灌婴打败楚军，杀死楚将龙且，追击到城阳，俘虏了齐王田广。

齐相田横自立为齐王，投奔彭越。

汉王立张耳为赵王。

汉王病愈后，向西进入函谷关，到达栎阳，慰问父老，设置酒宴。

把前塞王司马欣的头悬挂在栎阳街市示众。

停留四天，又回到军中，驻军广武。

关中的士兵不断出动，而彭越、田横占据梁地，往来骚扰楚军，断绝他们的粮食。

韩信已经打败齐国，派人对汉王说：“齐国靠近楚国，我的权力轻，如果不做代理王，恐怕不能安定齐国。”

汉王发怒，想攻打他。

张良说：“不如趁机立他为王，让他自己防守。”

春二月，派遣张良带着印信，立韩信为齐王。

秋七月，立黥布为淮南王。

八月，开始征收算赋。

北貉、燕人派来勇猛的骑兵援助汉王。

汉王下令：士兵不幸战死的，官吏为他们准备衣服、被子、棺材收殓，转送到他们家中。

天下人都诚心归附。

项羽自己知道援助少而粮食耗尽，韩信又进兵攻打楚国，项羽对此感到忧虑。

汉王派遣陆贾劝说项羽，请求放回太公，项羽不听。

汉王又派侯公劝说项羽，项羽于是和汉王约定，平分天下，割鸿沟以西归汉，以东归楚。

九月，放回太公、吕后，军队都欢呼万岁。

于是封侯公为平国君。

项羽解除包围向东返回。

汉王想向西返回，张良、陈平劝谏说：“现在汉拥有大半个天下，而诸侯都归附，楚军疲惫且粮食耗尽，这是上天灭亡楚国的时候，不趁这个机会夺取天下，这是养虎给自己留下祸患。”

汉王听从了他们的意见。</div>

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Kao-tsu was a man from the hamlet of Chung-yang [in the district] town of Feng, [prefecture of] P'ei. His surname was Liu.

His father was called the "Old Sir" Liu, and his mother was called "Madam Liu."

Kao-tsu had a high nose and a beard like a dragon's; he had the bearing of a dragon and the voice of a tiger. On his left thigh there were seventy-two dark spots.

He was generous and lenient, and did not like to engage in farming.

He was an adult when he became a minor official in P'ei, and he was on familiar terms with all the officials in the county.

He loved wine and women. He often drank at the taverns of Wang and Wu, and stayed there overnight. The tavern keepers often saw a dragon above him when he was drunk, and they were surprised.

Every time he drank and stayed, the taverns sold several times more wine than usual. When they calculated their accounts at the end of the month, they always tore up his bills and did not ask him for payment.

Kao-tsu once went to Ch'ang-an to serve as a minor official, and when he saw Emperor Ch'in Shih-huang on a tour, he sighed and said, "Ah, this is what a real man should be like!"

Lü Kung, a native of Shan-yang, moved to P'ei to avoid his enemies, because he was on good terms with the magistrate of P'ei.

All the officials and gentry of P'ei came to congratulate him on his move.

Hsiao Ho was in charge of receiving the guests, and he said, "Those who give less than one thousand coins shall sit in the outer hall."

Kao-tsu, who was a minor official, came in, wrote on the guest book, "A gift of ten thousand coins," but in fact he had no money.

When the name card was brought in, Lü Kung was surprised, got up, and went to the gate to welcome him.

Lü Kung was good at physiognomy, and when he looked at Kao-tsu's face, he was very impressed and treated him with great respect, leading him to the upper seat.

Hsiao Ho said, "Kao-tsu often talks big but does not accomplish much."

Kao-tsu, however, paid no attention and sat in the upper seat, joking with the others.

After the banquet, Lü Kung winked at Kao-tsu and asked him to stay.

At the end of the feast, [Kao-tsu] stayed behind. Lü Kung said, "I have seen many people in my life, but none as outstanding as you. I hope you will cherish yourself."

"I have a daughter, and I would like to give her to you as your wife."

After the banquet, Madam Lü was angry with Lü Kung and said, "You always said that our daughter was unusual and should be married to a nobleman."

"The magistrate of P'ei proposed to her, but you refused. Why did you give her to Kao-tsu?"

Lü Kung said, "This is not something you women can understand." He gave his daughter to Kao-tsu in marriage.

She was the future Empress Lü, who gave birth to Emperor Hui and Princess Lu Yuan.

Kao-tsu once asked for leave to return home to work in the fields.

Empress Lü and their two children lived in the fields. An old man passed by and asked for a drink. Empress Lü then gave him food.

The old man looked at Empress Lü and said, "Madam, you are a noble person in the world."

He was asked to look at the two children. When he saw Emperor Hui, he said, "The reason why you are noble, Madam, is this boy."

When he looked at Princess Lu Yuan, he also said she would be noble.

After the old man left, Kao-tsu happened to come from the nearby house. Empress Lü told him in detail, "A guest passed by and read our fortunes, saying that my children and I will all be very noble."

Kao-tsu asked where the old man was, and Empress Lü said, "He hasn't gone far." Kao-tsu then chased after him and asked the old man.

The old man said, "Just now, I saw that your wife and children will be noble because of you. Your appearance is extremely noble, beyond words."

Kao-tsu thanked him and said, "If what you say is true, I will not forget your kindness."

When Kao-tsu became noble, he no longer knew where the old man was.

When Kao-tsu was a亭 chief, he made a crown of bamboo skin and ordered the thief-catcher to have it made in Xue. He often wore it, and continued to wear it when he became noble. This is what is called the "Liu's Crown."

As a亭 chief, Kao-tsu was sent by the county to escort convicts to Mount Li. Many convicts escaped on the way.

He thought to himself, "By the time we reach Mount Li, all of them will have escaped." When they reached Hsia-pei, they stopped for the night, and Kao-tsu got drunk. He released all the prisoners and said, "You all go your own way. I am going to escape too!"

The prisoners were very grateful, and about a dozen strong men decided to follow him.

Kao-tsu, with a sword in his hand, walked ahead. Someone reported, "There is a big snake blocking the road ahead. Let's go back."

The person walking ahead came back and reported, "There is a big snake blocking the path ahead. I hope we can go back."

Kao-tsu, who was drunk, said, "A brave man has nothing to fear!" He went forward, cut the snake in two with his sword.

The snake was split into two parts, and the road opened up.

They continued on their way for several miles, and Kao-tsu fell asleep.

Later, people came to the place where the snake was cut. An old woman was crying at night.

Someone asked her why she was crying, and she said, "My son was killed."

Someone said, "Why was your son killed?"

The old woman said, "My son is the son of the White Emperor. He turned into a snake and blocked the road, but now he was killed by the son of the Red Emperor, so I am crying."

People thought she was not being honest and wanted to make things difficult for her, but she suddenly disappeared.

When the others arrived, Kao-tsu woke up. They told him what had happened, and he was very pleased with himself.

His followers became more and more afraid of him day by day.

Emperor Qin Shi Huang once said, "There is an aura of an emperor in the southeast." So he traveled east to suppress it.

Kao-tsu hid in the marshes and valleys of Mangdang Mountains. Empress Lü and others often went to look for him and always found him.

Kao-tsu asked Empress Lü in surprise. She said, "There is always an aura of clouds above where you live, so I can always find you by following that."

Kao-tsu was very happy again. Some young people in Pei heard about this and most wanted to join him.

In the first year of the Second Emperor of Qin, in the seventh month of autumn, Chen Sheng rebelled in Qi County.

When he reached Chen, he proclaimed himself King of Chu and sent Wu Chen, Zhang Er, and Chen Yu to capture Zhao.

In August, Wu Chen proclaimed himself King of Zhao.

In many counties, officials killed their superiors to respond to Chen Sheng.

In September, the magistrate of Pei wanted to respond to him with Pei.

The assistant magistrate and chief official Xiao He and Cao Can said, "You are an official of Qin. Now you want to betray Qin and lead the young people of Pei. I'm afraid they won't listen."

"We hope you can summon those who have fled outside. You can get hundreds of people and take this opportunity to coerce everyone, and they will not dare to disobey."

So he ordered Fan Kuai to summon Kao-tsu.

Kao-tsu already had hundreds of followers.

So Fan Kuai came with Kao-tsu.

The magistrate of Pei regretted it, feared that there would be changes, so he closed the city gates for defense and wanted to kill Xiao He and Cao Can.

Xiao He and Cao Can were afraid, climbed over the city wall and went to Kao-tsu for protection.

Kao-tsu then wrote a letter on silk and shot it onto the city wall, telling the elders of Pei:

"The whole world has suffered from Qin for a long time. Now although you elders are defending the city for the magistrate of Pei, the feudal lords have risen up together and will massacre Pei."

"Now, if Pei kills the magistrate together, chooses someone worthy to support, and responds to the feudal lords, your families will be safe."

"Otherwise, fathers and sons will all be massacred, which is meaningless."

The elders then led the young people to kill the magistrate of Pei, opened the city gates to welcome Kao-tsu, and wanted him to be the magistrate of Pei.

Kao-tsu said, "The world is in turmoil, and the feudal lords have risen together. If we appoint an inappropriate general now, we will be utterly defeated."

"I do not dare to cherish myself, but I am afraid that my ability is shallow and I cannot protect the elders, 乡亲，brothers and nephews."

"This is a major event, and I hope to choose a suitable person again."

Hsiao Ho and Ts'ao Ch'ang were both civil officials who valued their own safety. Fearing that the undertaking might fail and that later the Ch'in [government] would exterminate their families, they all deferred to Kao-tsu.

All the elders said, "We have heard all our lives about Liu Ji's strange deeds, which indicate he should be noble. Moreover, the result of divination shows that no one is more auspicious than Liu Ji."

Kao-tsu declined several times, but no one was willing to take [the position], so Kao-tsu was established as the Duke of P'ei.

He sacrificed to Huangdi and Chiyou in the court of Pei, and smeared the drums and flags with the blood of animals to hold a sacrificial ceremony.

The flags were all red because the snake that was killed was the son of the White Emperor, and the one who killed the snake was the son of the Red Emperor.

Thus, young heroic officials such as Xiao He, Cao Can, and Fan Kuai all recruited young people from Pei and got three thousand men.

In this month, Xiang Liang and his elder brother's son Xiang Yu rose up in Wu.

Tian Dan and his cousins Tian Rong and Tian Heng rose up in Qi, and Tian Dan proclaimed himself King of Qi.

Han Guang proclaimed himself King of Yan.

Wei Jiu proclaimed himself King of Wei.

Chen Sheng's general Zhou Zhang entered the Hangu Pass to the west, reached Xi, and the Qin general Zhang Han confronted and defeated him.

In the tenth month of the second year of Qin [Ershi], the Duke of P'ei attacked Hulu and Fangyu, and returned to garrison Feng.

The Supervisor of Sichuan in Qin, Ping, led troops to surround Feng.

Two days later, they sent troops to fight him and defeated him.

Ordered Yong Chi to garrison Feng.

In the eleventh month, the Duke of P'ei led his troops to Xue.

The army of the Governor of Sichuan in Qin, Zhuang, was defeated in Xue and fled to Qi. The Left Sima of the Duke of P'ei captured and killed him.

The Duke of P'ei returned his army to Kangfu and arrived at Fangyu.

King Wu Chen of Zhao was killed by his general.

In the twelfth month, King Chen Sheng of Chu was killed by his charioteer.

The Wei man Zhou Shi captured the area around Feng and Pei, and sent someone to say to Yong Chi, "Feng is the place where the former Liang State migrated."

"Now there are dozens of cities in Wei that have been pacified. If you surrender to Wei now, Wei will enfeoff you as a marquis to garrison Feng; if you do not surrender, Feng will be massacred."

Yong Chi had always been unwilling to belong to the Duke of P'ei. When Wei recruited him, he rebelled and garrisoned Feng for Wei.

The Duke of P'ei attacked Feng but failed to capture it.

The Duke of P'ei returned to Pei and resented Yong Chi and the young people of Feng for betraying him.

In the first month, Zhang Er and others established Zhao Xie, a descendant of Zhao, as King of Zhao.

Ning Jun of Dongyang and Qin Jia established Jing Ju as King of Chu and stationed in Liu.

The Duke of P'ei went to join him, met Zhang Liang on the way, and then went to see Jing Ju with him, requesting troops to attack Feng.

At that time, Zhang Han pursued Chen Sheng's army, and another general Sima Ang led his troops north to pacify Chu, massacred Xiang County, and reached Dang County.

Ning Jun of Dongyang and the Duke of P'ei led their troops west, fought with Sima Ang's army west of Xiao County, which was not going well, and returned to gather their troops in Liu.

In the second month, they attacked Dang County and captured it three days later.

They incorporated the army of Dang County, got six thousand men, and combined with the original soldiers, there were a total of nine thousand men.

In the third month, they attacked and captured Fangyi.

They returned to attack Feng but failed to capture it.

In the fourth month, Xiang Liang killed Jing Ju and Qin Jia, stationed in Xue, and the Duke of P'ei went to see him.

Xiang Liang gave the Duke of P'ei an additional five thousand soldiers and ten generals of the fifth rank.

The Duke of P'ei returned, led his troops to attack Feng, and captured it.

Yong Chi fled to Wei.

In the fifth month, Xiang Yu captured Xiangcheng and returned.

Xiang Liang summoned all the other generals.

In the sixth month, the Duke of P'ei went to Xue and together with Xiang Liang established Mi Xin, the grandson of King Huai of Chu, as King Huai of Chu.

Zhang Han defeated and killed King Jiu of Wei and King Dan of Qi in Linji.

In the seventh month, there was heavy rain continuously.

The Duke of P'ei attacked Kangfu.

Zhang Han besieged Tian Rong in Dong'e.

The Duke of P'ei and Xiang Liang rescued Tian Rong together and defeated Zhang Han greatly in Dong'e.

Tian Rong returned, and the Duke of P'ei and Xiang Yu pursued the defeated soldiers, reached Chengyang, attacked and massacred Chengyang.

They stationed their army east of Puyang, fought with Zhang Han again, and defeated him again.

Zhang Han rallied again, garrisoned Puyang, and dug ditches around the city to lead water.

The Duke of P'ei and Xiang Yu left to attack Dingtao.

In the eighth month, Tian Rong established Tian Shi, the son of Tian Dan, as King of Qi.

Dingtao was not captured. The Duke of P'ei and Xiang Yu went west to capture land to Yongqiu, fought with the Qin army, defeated the Qin army greatly, and killed Li You, the governor of Sanchuan.

They returned to attack Waihuang, but Waihuang was not captured.

Xiang Liang defeated the Qin army again and looked arrogant.

Song Yi remonstrated, but Xiang Liang did not listen.

Qin sent additional troops to Zhang Han.

In the ninth month, Zhang Han let his soldiers attack Xiang Liang stationed in Dingtao at night with their mouths gagged, defeated Xiang Liang's army greatly, and killed Xiang Liang.

At that time, it rained continuously from July to September.

The Duke of P'ei and Xiang Yu were attacking Chenliu. Hearing that Xiang Liang was dead, the soldiers were very afraid, so they led their troops east with General Lü Chen, and moved King Huai from Xutai to Pengcheng to make it the capital.

Lü Chen's army was stationed east of Pengcheng, Xiang Yu's army was stationed west of Pengcheng, and the Duke of P'ei's army was stationed in Dang County.

Wei Bao, the younger brother of Wei Jiu, proclaimed himself King of Wei.

In the intercalary ninth month, King Huai merged Lü Chen's and Xiang Yu's armies and led them personally.

He appointed the Duke of P'ei as the governor of Dangjun, enfeoffed him as Marquis of Wuan, and let him lead the army of Dangjun.

He appointed Xiang Yu as Duke of Lu and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Chang'an.

Lü Chen was Situ, and his father Lü Qing was Lingyin.

Zhang Han had defeated Xiang Liang and thought that the army in Chu was not worth worrying about, so he crossed the Yellow River to attack King Xie of Zhao to the north and defeated King Xie greatly.

King Xie retreated to Julu City, and the Qin general Wang Li besieged him.

The King of Chao repeatedly requested aid, so King Huai appointed Sung I as Supreme Commander, Hsiang Yü as his deputy, and Fan Tseng as junior general, to lead an army north to rescue Chao.

Earlier, King Huai had made an agreement with the various generals: whoever first entered and pacified Kuan-chung should be made king of it.

At that time, the Ch'in army was strong and often pursued the retreating enemy in victory, so none of the generals thought it advantageous to be the first to enter the pass.

Only Yü, bearing a grudge against Ch'in for having defeated Hsiang Liang, was eager to go and offered to join Liu Pang in leading an army west to enter the pass.

The older generals of King Huai all said, "Hsiang Yü is a fierce and destructive man. He once attacked Hsiang-ch'eng, and not a soul was left alive there. Every place he passes through is devastated."

"Moreover, Ch'u has made several attempts to advance, but King Chen and Hsiang Liang both failed. It would be better to send a worthy elder to march west in the name of justice and explain our intentions to the elders and brothers of Ch'in."

"The elders and brothers of Ch'in have long suffered under their rulers. If we really send a worthy elder who will not oppress or brutalize them, we should be able to conquer the land."

"Hsiang Yü must not be sent. Only Liu Pang has always been a generous and worthy elder."

In the end, they did not accede to Yü's request but sent Liu Pang west to gather the scattered soldiers of King Chen and Hsiang Liang.

Liu Pang then took the road from Tang to Ch'eng-yang and Kang-li, attacked the Ch'in army's fortifications, and defeated two of their armies.

In the tenth month of the third year of Ch'in [Erh-shih], T'ien Tu, a general of Ch'i, rebelled against T'ien Jung and led troops to help Hsiang Yü rescue Chao.

Liu Pang defeated the Commandant of Tung-chün at Ch'eng-wu.

In the eleventh month, Hsiang Yü killed Sung I, merged his army, crossed the Yellow River, and proclaimed himself Supreme Commander. All the generals, including Ch'ing Pu, submitted to him.

In the twelfth month, Liu Pang led his army to Li, encountered the Martial Lord of Kang, seized over four thousand men from his army, merged them into his own, and joined forces with the Wei generals Huang Hsin and Wu Man to attack the Ch'in army, defeating them.

T'ien An, grandson of the former King Chien of Ch'i, captured Chi-pei and followed Hsiang Yü to rescue Chao.

Yü inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ch'in army at Chü-lu, captured Wang Li, and put Chang Han to flight.

In the second month, Liu Pang marched north from Tang to attack Ch'ang-i, where he met P'eng Yüeh.

Yüeh helped attack Ch'ang-i but failed to capture it.

Liu Pang proceeded west past Kao-yang, where Li Shih-ch'i, the gatekeeper of the hamlet, said, "Many generals have passed this way, but I see that Liu Pang is a man of great generosity."

He asked to see Liu Pang.

Liu Pang was sitting on a couch with two women washing his feet.

Shih-ch'i did not bow but made a deep bow with his hands clasped and said, "If you truly wish to destroy the tyrannical Ch'in, you should not receive a worthy elder while sitting like this."

Thereupon Liu Pang rose, straightened his robes, apologized, and invited him to take a seat of honor.

Shih-ch'i advised Liu Pang to make a surprise attack on Ch'en-liu.

Liu Pang made Shih-ch'i Lord of Kuang-yeh and appointed his younger brother Li Shang as a general to command the troops of Ch'en-liu.

In the third month, they attacked K'ai-feng but failed to capture it.

They marched west to engage the Ch'in general Yang Hsiung at Pai-ma, then fought east of Ch'ü-yü, inflicting a crushing defeat on him.

Yang Hsiung fled to Hsing-yang, but the Second Emperor sent messengers to execute him and display his head as a warning.

In the fourth month, they marched south to attack Ying-ch'uan and massacred the city.

With the help of Chang Liang, they went on to conquer the land of Han.

At that time, Ssu-ma Ang, a subordinate general of Chao, was about to cross the Yellow River to enter the pass. Liu Pang therefore marched north to attack P'ing-yin and block the river fords.

He then marched south, fought east of Lo-yang, but his army met with misfortune. He proceeded from Huan-yüan to Yang-ch'eng, gathering the horses and cavalry of his army.

In the sixth month, he fought with the Governor of Nan-yang, Yi, east of Ch'ou and defeated him.

He conquered Nan-yang Commandery. The Governor of Nan-yang fled and took refuge in the city of Yüan, defending it.

Liu Pang led his army past the west of Yüan.

Chang Liang remonstrated, "Although you wish to enter the pass quickly, the Ch'in army is still numerous and holds strategic positions."

"If you do not capture Yüan now, the army of Yüan will attack you from behind while the strong Ch'in army faces you in front. This is a dangerous course."

Thereupon Liu Pang led his army back by another road at night, lowering his banners. At dawn, he surrounded Yüan with three rings of troops.

The Governor of Nan-yang was about to commit suicide when his retainer Ch'en Hui said, "It is not yet time to die."

He climbed over the city wall to see Liu Pang and said, "I have heard that you have made an agreement that whoever first enters Hsien-yang shall be king of it. Now you are staying to attack Yüan."

Yüan and its dependent cities number several tens, and their officials and people, thinking they will surely die if they surrender, are all defending the city from the walls.

"If you continue attacking day after day, many of your soldiers will be killed or wounded. If you lead your army away, the army of Yüan will surely follow you."

"You will lose the agreement to be first in Hsien-yang and face the danger of the strong army of Yüan behind you."

"For your own good, it would be better to make a pact for their surrender, enfeoff the governor, and let him remain to defend the city while leading his soldiers west with you."

"All the cities that have not yet been captured, hearing of this, will rush to open their gates to await you, and you will pass through without hindrance."

Liu Pang said, "Good."

In the seventh month, the Governor of Nan-yang, Yi, surrendered. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Yin, and Ch'en Hui was enfeoffed with a fief of a thousand families.

Liu Pang led his army west, and no city could resist him.

When he reached Tan-shui, the Martial Lord of Kao, Ssu, and the Marquis of Hsiang, Wang Ling, surrendered.

He turned back to attack Hu-yang, where he met Mei Hsüan, a subordinate general of the Lord of Fan. Together they attacked Hsi and Li, which both surrendered.

Wherever they passed, no plundering was allowed, and the people of Ch'in rejoiced.

He sent Ning Chang, a man of Wei, as an envoy to Ch'in.

In this month, Chang Han led his entire army to surrender to Hsiang Yü, who made him King of Yung.

Shen Yang of Hsia-ch'iu conquered Ho-nan.

In the eighth month, Liu Pang attacked Wu-kuan and entered Ch'in.

The Prime Minister of Ch'in, Chao Kao, fearing for his safety, killed the Second Emperor and sent envoys to propose dividing Kuan-chung and making each of them king, but Liu Pang refused.

In the ninth month, Chao Kao established Tzu-ying, son of the Second Emperor's elder brother, as King of Ch'in.

Tzu-ying executed Chao Kao and sent generals to defend Yao Pass with troops.

Liu Pang wanted to attack them, but Chang Liang said, "The Ch'in army is still strong; we must not take them lightly."

"I suggest first sending men to put up more banners on the mountains as a decoy, and sending Li Shih-ch'i and Lu Chia to persuade the Ch'in generals, luring them with benefits."

The Ch'in generals indeed wanted to make a pact, and Liu Pang was inclined to agree.

Chang Liang said, "Only their generals want to rebel; I fear their soldiers will not follow. It would be better to attack while they are 懈怠."

Liu Pang led his army around Yao Pass, crossed K'uei Mountain, attacked the Ch'in army, and inflicted a crushing defeat on them south of Lan-t'ien.

They proceeded to Lan-t'ien and fought again north of the city, where the Ch'in army was thoroughly defeated.

In the tenth month of winter in the first year [of Liu Pang's reign], the five planets converged in the constellation Tung-ching.

Liu Pang reached Pa-shang.

King Tzu-ying of Ch'in, riding in a plain cart drawn by white horses, with a silk cord around his neck, sealed the imperial seal, tally, and insignia, and surrendered beside the Chih Road.

Some generals suggested executing the King of Ch'in, but Liu Pang said, "When King Huai first sent me, it was because of my reputation for leniency. Moreover, he has surrendered; it would be inauspicious to kill him."

He turned him over to the officials.

He then proceeded west into Hsien-yang.

Liu Pang wanted to stay in the palace to rest, but Fan Kuai and Chang Liang remonstrated. He then sealed the storehouses of Ch'in's treasures and valuables and returned his army to Pa-shang.

Hsiao Ho collected all the maps, registers, and documents from the Prime Minister's residence of Ch'in.

In the eleventh month, he summoned the leading men of all counties and said, "Elders, you have long suffered under Ch'in's harsh laws: those who criticized the government were executed along with their families, and those who spoke together in groups were put to death in the marketplace.

"I made an agreement with the feudal lords that whoever first entered the pass should be king here, so I should be king of Kuan-chung.

"I make three agreements with you elders: murderers shall be put to death, those who injure others or steal shall be punished according to their crimes.

"All other Ch'in laws are abolished.

"Officials and people shall remain in their positions as before.

"The reason I have come is to remove harm from you elders, not to oppress or harm you. Do not fear!"

"Furthermore, the reason my army is stationed at Pa-shang is to wait for the feudal lords to arrive and establish regulations together."

He then sent men with Ch'in officials to proclaim this to all counties, towns, and villages.

The people of Ch'in were overjoyed and vied with each other to bring cattle, sheep, wine, and food to offer to the soldiers.

Liu Pang declined, saying, "There is plenty of grain in the storehouses; I do not want to burden the people."

The people were even more delighted, fearing only that Liu Pang would not become King of Ch'in.

Someone advised Liu Pang, saying, "Ch'in is ten times richer than the rest of the empire and has a strong geographical position.

"Now we hear that Chang Han has surrendered to Hsiang Yü, who has titled him King of Yung and given him rule over Kuan-chung.

"When he comes, you 恐怕 will not be able to hold this land.

"You should quickly send troops to guard Han-ku Pass, prevent the feudal lords' armies from entering, gradually conscript soldiers from Kuan-chung to strengthen your forces, and resist them."

Liu Pang approved of this plan and followed it.

In the twelfth month, Hsiang Yü indeed led the feudal lords' armies west to enter the pass, but the gate was closed.

Hearing that Liu Pang had already pacified Kuan-chung, Hsiang Yü was furious and sent Ch'ing Pu and others to break through Han-ku Pass, then proceeded to Hsi-hsia.

Liu Pang's Left Sima, Ts'ao Wu-shang, hearing that Hsiang Yü was angry and wanted to attack Liu Pang, sent word to Hsiang Yü, saying, "Liu Pang wants to be king of Kuan-chung, make Tzu-ying his prime minister, and keep all the treasures for himself."

He hoped to gain a fief by this.

Fan Tseng, the "Second Father," advised Hsiang Yü, "When Liu Pang was in Shan-tung, he was greedy for wealth and fond of women.

"Now we hear that since entering the pass, he has taken no valuables and shown no interest in women, which means his ambitions are not small.

"I have sent men to observe his aura, which resembles dragons in five colors—this is the aura of an emperor.

"Attack him quickly; do not miss the opportunity."

Thereupon Hsiang Yü feasted his soldiers, preparing to do battle the next day.

At this time, Hsiang Yü's army numbered 400,000, 号称 ing a million.

Liu Pang's army numbered 100,000, 号称 ing 200,000, and was no match.

It happened that Hsiang Po, Hsiang Yü's uncle and Left Assistant, had long been on good terms with Chang Liang. He rode to see Chang Liang at night, told him the whole truth, and wanted to take him away so that he would not die needlessly.

Chang Liang said, "I am escorting Liu Pang for King Han; I must inform him. It would be unjust to flee without a word."

He then went with Hsiang Po to see Liu Pang.

Liu Pang made a pact of marriage with Hsiang Po and said, "Since entering the pass, I have not dared to take the smallest thing. I have registered the officials and people, sealed the storehouses, and waited for the general.

"The reason I guarded the pass was to 防备 other bandits.

"I have waited day and night for your arrival; how could I dare to rebel!

"I hope you will make it clear that I dare not violate my duty."

Hsiang Po promised, then returned that night and warned Liu Pang, "You must come early tomorrow in person to apologize."

When Hsiang Po returned, he told Hsiang Yü all that Liu Pang had said and added, "If Liu Pang had not first defeated the Ch'in army in Kuan-chung, how could you have entered?"

"Furthermore, he has rendered great service; it would be inauspicious to attack him. It would be better to treat him kindly."

Hsiang Yü agreed.

The next day, Liu Pang went to Hung-men with more than a hundred cavalry to see Hsiang Yü and apologized, saying, "I and your generalship joined forces to attack Ch'in. Your generalship fought north of the Yellow River, and I fought south of it. I never expected to enter the pass first, defeat Ch'in, and meet your generalship again.

"Now there have been slanderous words from petty men that have caused a rift between your generalship and me."

Yü said, "It was your Left Sima Ts'ao Wu-shang who said this; otherwise, how would I have come to this?"

Yü thereupon kept Liu Pang to drink with him.

Fan Tseng repeatedly signaled to Yü to attack Liu Pang, but Yü paid no heed.

Fan Tseng rose, went out, and said to Hsiang Chuang, "Our lord is too merciful to do it himself. You go in, perform a sword dance, and take the opportunity to strike Liu Pang and kill him.

"Otherwise, you and your men will be captured by him."

Chuang went in to offer a toast.

After the toast, he said, "There is no entertainment in the army; allow me to perform a sword dance."

He thereupon drew his sword and began to dance.

Hsiang Po also rose to dance, often using his body to shield Liu Pang like a bird spreading its wings.

Fan Kuai, hearing that matters were urgent, rushed in, greatly enraged.

Yü, impressed by his bravery, gave him wine.

Kuai thereupon rebuked Yü.

After a while, Liu Pang rose to go to the latrine, summoned Fan Kuai to come out, left his carriage and attendants, and rode alone, while Fan Kuai, Chin Ch'iang, Teng-kung, and Chi Ch'eng walked, taking a back road to the army camp. He sent Chang Liang to stay and apologize to Yü.

Yü asked, "Where is Liu Pang?"

[Chang Liang] replied, "Hearing that your generalship intended to reproach him, he escaped and returned to the army by a back road, so he sent me to present this jade disc."

Yü accepted it.

He also presented a jade cup to Fan Tseng.

Tseng, enraged, smashed the cup, rose, and said, "We are now going to be captured by Liu Pang!"

A few days after Liu Pang returned, Yü led his army west to sack Hsien-yang, killed Tzu-ying, the surrendered King of Ch'in, burned the Ch'in palaces, and devastated everything in his path, greatly disappointing the people of Ch'in.

Yü sent men back to report to King Huai, who said, "Abide by the agreement."

Yü resented King Huai for refusing to let him go west into the pass with Liu Pang, sending him instead to rescue Chao in the north, thus delaying the fulfillment of the agreement.

He said, "King Huai was only established by my family. He has no meritorious deeds; how can he alone preside over the agreement!

"It is the generals and I who have pacified the empire."

In the first month of spring, he nominally honored King Huai as Emperor Yi but in fact did not obey his commands.

In the second month, Yü proclaimed himself Hegemon-King of Western Ch'u, ruling nine commanderies in the regions of Liang and Ch'u, with his capital at P'eng-ch'eng.

Breaking the agreement, he re-established Liu Pang as King of Han, ruling forty-one counties in Pa, Shu, and Han-chung, with his capital at Nan-cheng.

He divided Kuan-chung into three parts and enfeoffed three surrendered Ch'in generals as kings: Chang Han as King of Yung, with his capital at Fei-ch'iu;

Ssu-ma Hsin as King of Sai, with his capital at Yüeh-yang; and Tung I as King of Chai, with his capital at Kao-nu.

The Ch'u general Shen Yang of Hsia-ch'iu was made King of Ho-nan, with his capital at Lo-yang.

The Chao general Ssu-ma Ang was made King of Yin, with his capital at Chao-ko.

Yang-yang Chun Ch'ing Pu was made King of Chiu-chiang, with his capital at Liu.

King Huai's Pillar of State, Kung Ao, was made King of Lin-chiang, with his capital at Chiang-ling.

The Lord of Fan, Wu Jui, was made King of Heng-shan, with his capital at Chu.

T'ien An, grandson of the former King Chien of Ch'i, was made King of Chi-pei.

King Pao of Wei was moved to be King of Western Wei, with his capital at P'ing-yang.

King Han Kuang of Yen was moved to be King of Liao-tung.

The Yen general Tsang Tu was made King of Yen, with his capital at Chi.

King T'ien Shih of Ch'i was moved to be King of Chiao-tung.

The Ch'i general T'ien Tu was made King of Ch'i, with his capital at Lin-tzu.

King Hsieh of Chao was moved to be King of Tai.

The Prime Minister of Chao, Chang Erh, was made King of Ch'ang-shan.

King Han resented Yü for breaking the agreement and wanted to attack him, but his Prime Minister Hsiao Ho remonstrated, and he desisted.

In the fourth month of summer, the feudal lords disbanded their armies at Hsi-hsia and each went to his own state.

Yü sent thirty thousand soldiers to follow King Han, and several tens of thousands of men from Ch'u and the feudal states who admired and followed [King Han] entered the Shih Valley from south of Tu.

Chang Liang took leave to return to Han, and King Han saw him off to Pao-chung. He advised King Han to burn the plank roads to guard against surprise attacks by the feudal lords and also to show Yü that he had no intention of advancing east.

After King Han reached Nan-cheng, his generals and soldiers all sang songs longing to return east to their homes, and many deserted and went back on the way.

Han Hsin, who was a Grain Administrator, also deserted.

Hsiao Ho pursued him, brought him back, and recommended him to King Han, saying, "If you are determined to contend for the empire, there is no one but Hsin with whom you can plan affairs."

Thereupon King Han fasted, set up an altar, appointed Hsin as Grand General, and asked him for a plan.

Hsin replied, "Hsiang Yü broke the agreement and made your majesty king in Nan-cheng, which is an exile.

"Your officers and soldiers are all men from east of the Hsiao Mountains, longing day and night to return home. If you use their momentum, you can achieve great things.

"Once the empire is pacified, the people will all be content, and you will not be able to use them again.

"It would be better to decide to advance east."

He thereupon presented a plan to seize Yü and easily annex the Three Ch'in.

King Han was greatly pleased, followed Hsin's plan, and deployed his generals.

He left Hsiao Ho to collect taxes from Pa and Shu to supply the army with grain.

In the fifth month, King Han led his army out from Ku-tao to attack Yung.

King of Yung Chang Han met and attacked the Han army at Ch'en-ts'ang. The Yung army was defeated and fled back;

they fought at Hao-chih and were again badly defeated, fleeing to Fei-ch'iu.

King Han thereupon pacified the land of Yung.

He went east to Hsien-yang, led his army to besiege King of Yung in Fei-ch'iu, and sent his generals to conquer territory.

T'ien Jung, hearing that Yü had moved King of Ch'i T'ien Shih to Chiao-tung and made T'ien Tu King of Ch'i, was furious and led Ch'i's army to attack T'ien Tu.

Tu fled and surrendered to Ch'u.

In the sixth month, T'ien Jung killed T'ien Shih and proclaimed himself King of Ch'i.

At that time, P'eng Yüeh was in Chü-yeh with more than ten thousand men, not attached to any side.

T'ien Jung gave P'eng Yüeh a general's seal and ordered him to rebel in the Liang region.

Yüeh killed T'ien An, King of Chi-pei, and T'ien Jung thereupon annexed the lands of the Three Ch'i.

King Han Kuang of Yen also refused to move to Liao-tung.

In the eighth month of autumn, Tsang Tu killed Han Kuang and annexed his territory.

King of Sai [Ssu-ma] Hsin and King of Chai [Tung] I both surrendered to King Han.

Earlier, Hsiang Liang had established [Han] Chen, a descendant of the kings of Han, as King of Han, with Chang Liang as Han's Minister of Education.

Because Chang Liang was following King Han, and King Chen of Han had no merit, Yü would not send him to his state but took him to P'eng-ch'eng and killed him.

When he heard that King Han had annexed Kuan-chung and that Ch'i and Liang had rebelled against him, Yü was furious and appointed Cheng Ch'ang, former magistrate of Wu, as King of Han to resist King Han.

He ordered Hsiao-kung Chiao to attack P'eng Yüeh, but Yüeh defeated Chiao's troops.

At that time, Chang Liang was pacifying the Han region and sent a letter to Yü saying, "Han wants to obtain Kuan-chung and will stop once the agreement is fulfilled; he dares not advance east again."

For this reason, Yü had no intention of advancing west but attacked Ch'i to the north.

In the ninth month, King Han sent generals Hsüeh Ou and Wang Hsi to exit Wu-kuan, and with Wang Ling's troops, go from Nan-yang to Pei to meet [King Han's father] Old Sir Liu and Empress Lü.

When Yü heard of this, he sent troops to block them at Yang-hsia, preventing them from advancing.

In the tenth month of winter in the second year, Hsiang Yü ordered [Ch'ing] Pu, King of Chiu-chiang, to kill Emperor Yi in Ch'en.

Chen Yü, also resenting that Yü alone had not enfeoffed him as king, borrowed troops from T'ien Jung to attack Chang Erh, King of Ch'ang-shan.

Erh was defeated, fled, and surrendered to King Han, who treated him generously.

Chen Yü welcomed King Hsieh of Tai back to Chao, and Hsieh established Yü as King of Tai.

Chang Liang secretly returned to Han from Han, and King Han appointed him Marquis of Ch'eng-hsin.

King Han went to Shan to comfort the elders beyond the pass.

King of Ho-nan Shen Yang surrendered, and Ho-nan Commandery was established.

[King Han] sent Han Hsin,太尉 of Han, to attack Han, and King of Han Cheng Ch'ang surrendered.

In the eleventh month, Han Hsin,太尉 of Han, was established as King of Han.

King Han returned and made Yüeh-yang his capital, sending his generals to conquer territory and capture Lung-hsi.

Whoever led ten thousand men or a commandery to surrender was enfeoffed as a marquis with ten thousand households.

The fortifications along the Yellow River were repaired.

The former Ch'in parks, gardens, and ponds were opened to the people for cultivation.

In the first month of spring, Yü attacked T'ien Jung at Ch'eng-yang. Jung was defeated and fled to P'ing-yüan, where the people killed him.

All of Ch'i surrendered to Ch'u, but Ch'u burned their cities, so the people of Ch'i rebelled again.

The generals captured Pei-ti and took Chang P'ing, younger brother of the King of Yung, prisoner.

Prisoners were pardoned.

On kuei-wei in the second month, an order was given to the people to abolish the Ch'in altars to the spirits of earth and grain and establish Han's altars.

Kindnesses were bestowed, and the people were granted noble ranks.

The people of Shu and Han-chung, who had labored hard to supply the military, were exempted from taxes for two years.

The families of soldiers from Kuan-chung who joined the army were exempted from taxes for one year.

People over fifty years of age who were virtuous and able to lead others to do good were selected as "Three Elders," one per village.

One of the village Three Elders was chosen as county Three Elder to consult with the county magistrate, assistant magistrate, and commandant on affairs, and was exempted from labor service and border garrison duty.

Wine and meat were bestowed in the tenth month.

In the third month, King Han crossed the Yellow River at Lin-chin.

King Pao of Wei surrendered and led his troops to follow [King Han].

He captured Ho-nei, took King Yin [Ssu-ma] Ang prisoner, and established Ho-nei Commandery.

When he reached Hsiu-wu, Chen P'ing fled from Ch'u and came to surrender.

King Han spoke with him and was pleased, making him his charioteer and supervisor of the generals.

He crossed the Yellow River south at P'ing-yin Ford and reached Lo-yang. Tung Kung, Three Elder of Hsin-ch'eng, stopped him and advised, "I have heard that 'those who follow virtue prosper, those who oppose virtue perish' and that 'an army that marches without just cause will not succeed.'

"Therefore it is said, 'Make clear that they are bandits, and then the enemy can be subdued.'

"Hsiang Yü has acted tyrannically, exiling and killing his lord—he is a bandit to the whole world.

"Benevolence does not depend on courage, righteousness does not depend on force. Let your three armies wear mourning for [Emperor Yi] to inform the feudal lords, and then march east to attack [Yü]; all within the four seas will respect your virtue.

"This is the action of the Three Kings."

King Han said, "Good. I would not have heard this without you, sir."

Thereupon King Han held mourning for Emperor Yi, bared his left arm, wept loudly, and mourned for three days.

He sent envoys to inform the feudal lords, "The whole world jointly established Emperor Yi and served him, facing north.

"Now Hsiang Yü has exiled and killed Emperor Yi in Chiang-nan, committing a great treason and tyranny.

"I personally mourn him, and my troops all wear white mourning clothes.

"I will send out all troops from Kuan-chung, gather soldiers from the Three Rivers, sail south down the Yangtze and Han Rivers, and wish to follow the feudal lords in attacking the murderer of Emperor Yi in Ch'u."

In the fourth month of summer, T'ien Heng, younger brother of T'ien Jung, gathered several tens of thousands of men and established T'ien Kuang, son of Jung, as King of Ch'i.

Although Yü heard that Han was advancing east, he was already attacking Ch'i and wanted to defeat Ch'i first before attacking Han. For this reason, King Han was able to coerce the armies of five feudal lords to march east and attack Ch'u.

When they reached Wai-huang, P'eng Yüeh led thirty thousand men to submit to King Han.

King Han appointed Yüeh as Prime Minister of Wei and ordered him to pacify the Liang region.

King Han thereupon entered P'eng-ch'eng, seized Yü's beauties and treasures, and held a grand feast with wine.

When Yü heard of this, he ordered his generals to attack Ch'i, while he himself led thirty thousand elite troops from Lu through Hu-ling to Hsiao, attacking the Han army at dawn. A great battle was fought east of Ling-pi at P'eng-ch'eng on the Sui River, where Yü's army heavily defeated the Han army, killing many soldiers; the Sui River was blocked by corpses and stopped flowing.

They surrounded King Han three times over.

A great wind arose from the northwest, breaking trees, blowing down houses, lifting sand and stones, and darkening the day. The Ch'u army was thrown into chaos, and King Han was able to escape with several tens of cavalry.

Passing through P'ei, he sent men to look for his family, but they had already fled and could not be found.

King Han met [his son] Hsiao-hui and [his daughter] Princess Lu Yüan on the road and had them ride in his carriage.

Ch'u cavalry pursued King Han; in his urgency, he pushed the two children out of the carriage.

Teng-kung got down, picked them up, and put them back in the carriage, and they managed to escape.

Shen Shih-ch'i followed Old Sir Liu and Empress Lü by back roads, but they encountered Ch'u troops; Yü kept them in his army as hostages.

When the feudal lords saw that Han had been defeated, they all fled.

King of Sai [Ssu-ma] Hsin and King of Chai [Tung] I surrendered to Ch'u; King Yin [Ssu-ma] Ang died.

Empress Lü's elder brother, Marquis Chou Lü, led troops stationed at Hsia-yi; King Han went to him.

He gradually gathered soldiers and stationed his army at Tang.

King Han went west through the Liang region to Yü and said to the court usher Sui Ho, "If you can persuade [Ch'ing] Pu, King of Chiu-chiang, to raise troops and rebel against Ch'u, King Hsiang will certainly stay to attack him.

"If he can be detained for several months, I will certainly seize the empire."

Sui Ho went to persuade Pu, and indeed made him rebel against Ch'u.

In the fifth month, King Han camped at Hsing-yang; Hsiao Ho sent all the elderly, weak, and those not yet registered for service in Kuan-chung to the army.

Han Hsin also gathered troops and joined King Han, and the army's spirits were greatly revived.

They fought the Ch'u army between Ching and So south of Hsing-yang and defeated them.

They built a covered road connecting to the Yellow River to obtain grain from Ao Granary.

King Pao of Wei asked leave to return home to see his ailing relatives.

When he arrived, he blocked the Yellow River fords and rebelled, joining Ch'u.

In the sixth month, King Han returned to Yüeh-yang.

On jen-wu, he established the crown prince and pardoned prisoners.

He ordered the sons of the feudal lords in Kuan-chung to gather in Yüeh-yang to act as guards.

He diverted water to flood Fei-ch'iu; Fei-ch'iu surrendered, and Chang Han committed suicide.

The land of Yung was pacified, with more than eighty counties; he established Ho-shang, Wei-nan, Chung-ti, Lung-hsi, and Shang commanderies.

He ordered the sacrificial officials to sacrifice to Heaven, Earth, the four directions, the Supreme Lord, mountains, and rivers at the proper times.

He sent troops from Kuan-chung to garrison the border forts.

There was a great famine in Kuan-chung; a bushel of rice cost ten thousand coins, and people ate each other.

He ordered the people to go to Shu and Han-chung to find food.

In the eighth month of autumn, King Han went to Hsing-yang and said to Li Shih-ch'i, "Go and persuade King Pao of Wei with gentle words. If you can make him surrender, I will enfeoff you with ten thousand households in Wei."

Shih-ch'i went, but Pao would not listen.

King Han appointed Han Hsin as Left Prime Minister to attack Wei together with Ts'ao Ts'an and Kuan Ying.

When Shih-ch'i returned, King Han asked, "Who is Wei's grand general?"

He replied, "Po Chih."

The king said, "That one is still wet behind the ears; he cannot stand up to Han Hsin.

"Who is the cavalry commander?"

He said, "Feng Ching."

The king said, "That is the son of the Ch'in general Feng Wu-tse. Though worthy, he cannot stand up to Kuan Ying.

"Who is the infantry commander?"

He said, "Hsiang T'o."

The king said, "He cannot stand up to Ts'ao Ts'an. I have no worries."

In the ninth month, Hsin and others captured Pao and sent him by courier cart to Hsing-yang.

They pacified the land of Wei and established Ho-tung, T'ai-yüan, and Shang-tang commanderies.

Hsin sent men to request thirty thousand soldiers, hoping to march north to capture Yen and Chao, east to attack Ch'i, and south to cut off Ch'u's grain supply routes.

King Han gave them to him.

In the tenth month of winter in the third year, Han Hsin and Chang Erh went east down Ching-hsing to attack Chao, beheaded Chen Yü, and captured King Hsieh of Chao.

They established Ch'ang-shan and Tai commanderies.

On chia-hsü, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the eleventh month, on kuei-mao, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

After Sui Ho persuaded [Ch'ing] Pu, Pu raised troops to attack Ch'u.

Ch'u sent Hsiang Sheng and Lung Ch'ü to attack Pu, but Pu could not defeat them.

In the twelfth month, Pu and Sui Ho returned to Han by back roads.

King Han gave him some troops, and together they gathered soldiers and went to Ch'eng-kao.

Hsiang Yü several times raided and seized Han's covered roads; the Han army lacked food, so King Han and Li Shih-ch'i plotted to weaken Ch'u's power.

Shih-ch'i wanted to establish the descendants of the Six Kingdoms to form allies; King Han had seals made and was going to send Shih-ch'i to install them.

He asked Chang Liang about it, and Liang raised eight objections.

King Han stopped eating, spat out his food, and said, "You fool of a scholar, you almost ruined my business!"

He ordered the seals to be quickly destroyed.

He also asked Chen P'ing, then followed his plan, giving P'ing forty thousand catties of gold to sow discord between the ruler and ministers of Ch'u.

In the fourth month of summer, Hsiang Yü besieged King Han at Hsing-yang; King Han requested peace, offering to cede the land west of Hsing-yang to Han.

The "Second Father" [Fan Tseng] advised Yü to attack Hsing-yang urgently; King Han was worried about this.

Once Chen P'ing's离间 plan was put into action, Yü indeed suspected the "Second Father."

The "Second Father" left in a great rage and died of illness.

In the fifth month, General Chi Hsin said, "Matters are urgent! I request to deceive Ch'u so that you can escape in the meantime."

Thereupon Chen P'ing sent more than two thousand women out the east gate at night; the Ch'u army attacked them from all sides.

Chi Hsin then rode in the king's carriage, with a yellow canopy and a left pennant, and said, "The grain is exhausted; King Han surrenders to Ch'u."

The Ch'u army all shouted "Long live the king!" and went to the east of the city to watch, so King Han was able to escape through the west gate with several tens of cavalry.

ordered the Grandee Secretary Chou K'o, Wei Pao, and Ts'ung Kung to defend Hsing-yang.

When Yü saw Chi Hsin, he asked, "Where is King Han?"

[Chi Hsin] replied, "He has already gone out."

Yü had Hsin burned to death.

Chou K'o and Ts'ung Kung said to each other, "A king who has rebelled against his country is difficult to defend the city with."

Thereupon they killed Wei Pao.

King Han escaped from Hsing-yang and reached Ch'eng-kao.

He entered the pass from Ch'eng-kao, gathered troops, and wanted to advance east again.

Yuan-sheng advised King Han, saying, "Han and Ch'u have confronted each other at Hsing-yang for several years, and Han has often been in a difficult position.

"I hope your majesty will send troops out Wu-kuan; King Hsiang will certainly lead his army south. Your majesty should dig deep moats and build high ramparts, allowing the troops between Hsing-yang and Ch'eng-kao to rest for a while.

"Let Han Hsin and others pacify the Chao region north of the Yellow River, ally with Yen and Ch'i, and then your majesty can return to Hsing-yang.

"In this way, Ch'u will have many places to defend, and its strength will be divided.

"Han will get rest, then fight Ch'u again, and will certainly defeat them."

King Han followed his plan, sent troops to the area between Yüan and Yeh, and marched with [Ch'ing] Pu, gathering troops along the way.

When Yü heard that King Han was in Yüan, he indeed led his army south; King Han held firm to his ramparts and did not engage in battle with him.

In this month, P'eng Yüeh crossed the Sui River, fought with Hsiang Sheng and Hsüeh Kung at Hsia-p'i, defeated them, and killed Hsüeh Kung.

Yü sent Chung-kung to defend Ch'eng-kao while he himself went east to attack P'eng Yüeh.

King Han led his army north, defeated Chung-kung, and again stationed his army at Ch'eng-kao.

In the sixth month, Yü had defeated and driven away P'eng Yüeh; hearing that the Han army was again stationed at Ch'eng-kao, he led his army west, captured Hsing-yang, and took Chou K'o alive.

Yü said to K'o, "Be my general, and I will appoint you as Grand General and enfeoff you with thirty thousand households."

Chou K'o cursed, "If you do not quickly surrender to Han, you will now become a prisoner! You are no match for King Han."

Yü had Chou K'o boiled alive, killed Ts'ung Kung as well, captured King Hsin of Han, and then besieged Ch'eng-kao.

King Han broke through the siege, alone with Teng-kung in a carriage, escaped through the Jade Gate of Ch'eng-kao, crossed the Yellow River north, and stayed at Hsiao-hsiu-wu.

Claiming to be an envoy, he rode early in the morning into Chang Erh and Han Hsin's camp and seized their army.

He then sent Chang Erh north to gather troops in the Chao region.

In the seventh month of autumn, a comet appeared near the Great Horn.

King Han obtained Han Hsin's army, and morale was greatly revived again.

In the eighth month, he arrived at the south bank of the Yellow River, stationed his army at Hsiao-hsiu-wu, and wanted to fight again.

Lang Chung Cheng Chung advised King Han to stop, urging him to build high ramparts and dig deep moats and not to fight.

King Han followed his plan, sent Lu Wan and Liu Chia with twenty thousand soldiers and several hundred cavalry to cross the White Horse Ford into Ch'u territory, assist P'eng Yüeh in burning Ch'u's grain and supplies, defeat the Ch'u army again west of Yen-kuo, and capture Sui-yang, Wai-huang, and seventeen other cities.

In the ninth month, Yü said to the Marquis of Hai-ch'un, Grand Marshal Ts'ao Chiu, "Guard Ch'eng-kao carefully.

"Even if King Han wants to challenge, be careful not to fight with him; just do not let him advance east.

"I will certainly pacify the Liang region within fifteen days and then rejoin you, general."

Yü led his army east to attack P'eng Yüeh.

King Han sent Li Shih-ch'i to persuade King T'ien Kuang of Ch'i to disband his defending troops and make peace with Han.

In the tenth month of winter in the fourth year, Han Hsin used Kuai T'ung's plan to launch a surprise attack and defeat Ch'i.

King of Ch'i had Shih-ch'i boiled alive and fled east to Kao-mi.

When Yü heard that Han Hsin had defeated Ch'i and intended to attack Ch'u, he sent Lung Ch'ü to rescue Ch'i.

The Han army indeed challenged the Ch'u army at Ch'eng-kao several times, but the Ch'u army did not come out to fight.

They sent men to insult them for several days; Grand Marshal Chiu became angry and sent troops across the Ssu River.

When the soldiers were halfway across, the Han army attacked them, heavily defeated the Ch'u army, and seized all of Ch'u's gold, jade, and treasures.

Grand Marshal Chiu and Chief Clerk Hsin both committed suicide on the banks of the Ssu River.

King Han led his army across the Yellow River, recaptured Ch'eng-kao, stationed his army at Kuang-wu, and relied on grain from Ao Granary for supplies.

Yü captured more than ten cities in the Liang region; hearing that the Marquis of Hai-ch'un had been defeated, he led his army back.

The Han army was besieging Chung-li Mo east of Hsing-yang; hearing that Yü had arrived, they all fled to strategic locations.

Yü also stationed his army at Kuang-wu, confronting the Han army.

Strong young men suffered from military campaigns, and the elderly and weak were exhausted from transporting grain and supplies.

King Han and Yü went together to the edge of the Kuang-wu Gorge to talk.

Yü wanted to challenge King Han to single combat; King Han enumerated Yü's crimes, saying, "I and you initially both received orders from King Huai, which said that whoever first pacified Kuan-chung would be made king of it.

"You broke the agreement and made me king in Shu and Han-chung—this is your first crime.

"You falsely executed the Senior Champion and exalted yourself—this is your second crime.

"You should have returned to report after rescuing Chao, but you arbitrarily coerced the feudal lords' armies into the pass—this is your third crime.

"King Huai agreed that those entering Ch'in should not plunder violently, but you burned the Ch'in palaces, dug up Emperor Shih-huang's tomb, and seized his treasures for yourself—this is your fourth crime.

"You also forcibly killed Tzu-ying, the surrendered King of Ch'in—this is your fifth crime.

"You fraudulently buried two hundred thousand Ch'in youths alive at Hsin-an yet made their generals kings—this is your sixth crime.

"You enfeoffed all your generals with good lands yet moved and expelled the former lords, causing subordinates to compete in rebellion—this is your seventh crime.

"You drove Emperor Yi out of P'eng-ch'eng, made it your own capital, seized the land of the King of Han, merged Liang and Ch'u to make yourself king, and gave yourself more territory—this is your eighth crime.

"You sent men to secretly kill Emperor Yi in Chiang-nan—this is your ninth crime.

"You, as a subject, killed your lord, killed those who had surrendered, governed unjustly, broke your agreements, and are intolerable to the whole world—committing great treason and tyranny—this is your tenth crime.

"I lead a righteous army to follow the feudal lords in punishing cruel bandits. I can send convicted criminals to attack you. Why bother challenging you!"

Yü was enraged, and hidden crossbowmen shot and hit King Han.

King Han was wounded in the chest, but he touched his foot and said, "The bandit hit my toe!"

King Han lay ill from his wound. Chang Liang strongly urged him to get up and go to comfort the army, to calm the soldiers and prevent Ch'u from taking advantage of their victory.

King Han went out to inspect the army; his illness worsened, so he hurried into Ch'eng-kao.

In the eleventh month, Han Hsin and Kuan Ying defeated the Ch'u army, killed the Ch'u general Lung Ch'ü, pursued them to Ch'eng-yang, and captured King T'ien Kuang of Ch'i.

The Prime Minister of Ch'i, T'ien Heng, proclaimed himself King of Ch'i and fled to P'eng Yüeh.

Han established Chang Erh as King of Chao.

When King Han recovered from his illness, he went west into the pass, reached Yüeh-yang, comforted the elders, and held a feast.

He displayed the head of the former King of Sai [Ssu-ma] Hsin in the marketplace of Yüeh-yang.

He stayed for four days, then returned to the army, stationing them at Kuang-wu.

More troops from Kuan-chung kept coming out, while P'eng Yüeh and T'ien Heng occupied the Liang region, harassing the Ch'u army back and forth and cutting off their grain supply.

After Han Hsin defeated Ch'i, he sent word saying, "Ch'i borders Ch'u. My authority is weak. If I am not made acting king, I fear I cannot stabilize Ch'i."

King Han was angry and wanted to attack him.

Chang Liang said, "It would be better to take this opportunity to make him king and let him defend it himself."

In the second month of spring, he sent Chang Liang with a seal to establish Han Hsin as King of Ch'i.

In the seventh month of autumn, he established [Ch'ing] Pu as King of Huai-nan.

In the eighth month, the poll tax was first imposed.

The Northern Mo and Yen people sent elite cavalry to assist Han.

King Han ordered: If soldiers die不幸 in battle, officials shall prepare clothes, quilts, and coffins for them, and send them to their families.

People from all sides pledged their allegiance.

Hsiang Yü knew that he had few allies and his grain was exhausted, and Han Hsin was advancing to attack Ch'u, which worried Yü.

Han sent Lu Chia to persuade Yü to release Old Sir Liu, but Yü refused.

Han sent Marquis Kung again to persuade Yü, who then made an agreement with Han to divide the empire, ceding the land west of the Hong Canal to Han and east to Ch'u.

In the ninth month, Old Sir Liu and Empress Lü were returned, and the army all shouted "Long live!"

Marquis Kung was then enfeoffed as Lord of P'ing-kuo.

Yü lifted the siege and returned east.

King Han wanted to return west, but Chang Liang and Chen P'ing advised, "Now Han has more than half the empire, and the feudal lords all submit. The Ch'u army is exhausted and out of grain—this is the time Heaven has given to destroy Ch'u. If you do not profit by this opportunity and take [the kingdom of Ch'u], [you will be in the situation when] it is said: `By rearing a tiger one brings misfortune upon himself.' "

The King of Han followed [their counsel].</div>
