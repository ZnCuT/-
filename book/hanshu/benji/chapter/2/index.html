          <div class="txt">孝哀皇帝，元帝庶孙，定陶恭王子也。

时成帝少弟中山孝王亦来朝，独从傅。

上怪之，以问定陶王，

对曰：“令，诸侯王朝，得从其国二千石。傅、相、中尉皆国二千石，故尽从之。”

上令诵《诗》，通习，能说。

他日问中山王：“独从傅在何法令？” 不能对。

令诵《尚书》，又废。

及赐食于前，后饱；起下，袜系解。

成帝由此以为不能，而贤定陶王，数称其材。

时王祖母傅太后随王来朝，私赂遗上所幸赵昭仪及帝舅票骑将军曲阳侯王根。

昭仪及根见上亡子，亦欲豫自结为长久计，皆更称定陶王，劝帝以为嗣。

成帝亦自美其材，为加元服而遣之，时年十七矣。

明年，使执金吾任宏守大鸿胪，持节征定陶王，立为皇太子。

谢曰：“臣幸得继父守籓为诸侯王，材质不足以假充太子之宫。

陛下圣德宽仁，敬承祖宗，奉顺神祇，宜蒙福晁子孙千亿之报。

臣愿暂居京都馆舍，晨昏奉问皇上起居，待皇上有圣嗣之后，就归封国守藩。”

书奉，天子报闻。

太皇太后诏尊定陶恭王为恭皇。

五月丙戌，立皇后傅氏。

有司无得举赦前往事。

博士弟子父母死，予宁三年。”

秋，曲阳侯王根、成都侯王况皆有罪，根就国，况免为庶人，归故郡。

诏曰：“朕承宗庙之重，战战兢兢，惧失天心。

朕之不德，民反蒙辜，朕甚惧焉。

赦天下徒。”

罢州牧，复刺史。

上曰：“朕闻夫妇一体。

《诗》云：‘谷则异室，死则同穴。’

昔季武子成寝，杜氏之殡在西阶下，请合葬而许之。

附葬之礼，自周兴焉。

‘郁郁乎文哉！吾从周。’

孝子事亡如事存。

帝太后宜起陵恭皇之园。”

遂葬定陶。

发陈留、济阴近郡国五万人穿复土。

待诏夏贺良等言赤精子之谶，汉家历运中衰，当再受命，宜改元、易号。

夫基事之元命，必与天下自新，其大赦天下。

以建平二年为太初元年。

号曰陈圣刘太平皇帝。

漏刻以百二十为度。”

七月，以渭城西北原上永陵亭部为初陵。

勿徙郡国民，使得自安。

八月，诏曰：“待诏夏贺良等建言改元、易号，增益漏刻，可以永安国家。

朕过听贺良等言，冀为海内获福，卒亡嘉应。

皆违经背古，不合时宜。

六月甲子制书，非赦令也皆蠲除之。

贺良等反道惑众，下有司。”

皆伏辜。

惟阴阳不调，元元不赡，未赌厥咎。

娄敕公卿，庶几有望。

至今有司执法，未得其中，或上暴虐，假势获名，温良宽柔，陷于亡灭。

是故残贼弥长，和睦日衰，百姓愁怨，靡所错躬。

乃正月朔，日有蚀之，厥咎不远，在余一人。

公卿大夫其各悉心勉帅百寮，敦任仁人，黜远残贼，期于安民。

          <div class="txt">汉孝哀帝，是汉元帝的庶孙，定陶恭王的儿子。

此时成帝的少弟中山孝王也来朝见，却只有傅同来。

上甚不解，就问定陶王，

定陶王答道：“朝廷有令，各侯王来朝，其封国爵在二千石的官吏应一同前来。傅、相、中尉都是二千石，所以都应该一同前来。”

皇上叫他背诵《诗》，都很熟悉，且能说明其义。

又一日，成帝问中山王：“只要傅同来是根据哪条法令？” 中山王无言以对。

叫他背诵《尚书》，中间又遗忘了。

成帝请他吃饭，别人吃完了他还在吃，离席时，连袜带子也掉下来了。

成帝看到这些就认为中山王是个无能的人，而对定陶王则十分喜欢，经常夸他的才能。

此时定陶王的祖母傅太后陪同来朝，私下馈赠成帝所宠爱的赵昭仪及帝舅骠骑将军、曲阳侯王根。

赵昭仪及王根见皇上无子，也想早日与一位合适的王子建立关系保持自己的富贵长久，就都极力夸奖定陶王，劝成帝立他为太子。

成帝也很欣赏定陶王才能，就在朝中为他举行成人加冠礼后遣他回封地定陶，此时十七岁了。

第二年，皇上派执金吾任宏代理大鸿胪，持帝诏召定陶王，立为皇太子。

定陶王谢诏说：“小臣有幸得继承先父守藩为诸侯王，才能德性都不够进入太子之宫。

陛下圣德宽仁，敬承祖宗，奉顺神祗，理应受天之福多子多孙。

臣愿意暂时居住在京城中给诸侯暂住的居所里，晨昏奉问皇上起居，待皇上有圣嗣之后，就回到封地驻守驻守。”

书上奏后，天子说都知道了。

一个多月过后，下诏书立楚孝王孙刘景为定陶王，奉定陶恭王祭祀，这是为了奖励太子重视宗桃的品行。具体记载在《汉书・外戚传》。

绥和二年（公元前 7 年）三月，成帝驾崩。

四月初四日，太子即皇帝位，拜谒汉高祖庙。

尊皇太后为太皇太后，皇后为太后。

大赦天下，

赏赐宗室王子尚在五服之中的马各一乘 (四马)，吏民加爵，每百户牛酒若干，三老、孝悌力田、鳏寡孤独各赐布帛。

太皇太后下诏尊定陶恭王为恭皇。

五月十九日，立傅氏为皇后，

下诏说：“《春秋》有言‘母以子贵，’现尊定陶太后为恭皇太后，丁姬为恭皇后，各设左右省视官员，食邑与太后，皇后相同。”

追赠傅太后之父为崇祖侯，恭皇后丁姬之父为褒德侯。

封舅父丁明为阳安侯，舅父子丁满为平周侯。

追谥丁满之父丁忠为平周怀侯，皇后父傅晏为孔乡侯，皇太后之弟侍中光禄大夫赵钦为新成侯。

六月，下诏说：“郑声淫而乱乐，圣人所弃，现在罢免乐府。”

曲阳侯王根曾以大司马建议立太子以安社稷，加封二千户。

太仆安阳侯舜辅导有旧恩，加封五百户，另外丞相孔光，大司空汜乡侯何武各加封千户。

下诏说：“河间王良为太后服丧三年，是宗室表率，加封一万户。”

诏文又说：“制节谨慎适度以防止奢淫，是为政的首要任务，是历代不可改易的常法。

各侯王、列侯、公主、吏二千石及豪富民多富奴婢，田宅无限，与民争利使百姓失其常业，处于严重困境。

应制定限禁的条例。”

有关官员条呈：“各王、列侯能在其封国占有的田地，列侯在长安及公主在各县道占有的田地，关内侯、吏民占有的田地，都不得超过三十顷。

各侯王奴婢二百人，列侯、公主百人，关内侯、吏民三十人。

年六十以上、十岁以下，不在此数额之中。

商人都不允许占田、为吏，犯者按法论处。

凡是占田与畜奴婢超过限额的，都没收入县官。

齐三服官、诸官所织的绮绣、技术复杂难以达到这劳害女工之物，都停止制作，已制成的也不允许献纳。

撤销任二千石职达三年可以任一子为郎以及诽谤欺诬论罪之法。

内宫宫人在三十岁以下的，可以出嫁。

官家奴婢五十岁以上的，免去奴婢籍而为平民。

郡国不许献珍禽异兽。

增加吏禄在三百石以下的俸禄。

主持考察的官吏残暴酷虐的，发现后即时免职。

有关官员不得加重或赦免以前已作处置的旧案。

博士弟子父母死，赐与归家三年的服丧期。”

秋，曲阳侯王根、成都侯王况都有罪。王根离开京师到封地去，王况削职为民，回老家去。

下诏说：“朕继承大统的重任，战战兢兢惧失天心。

近来日月无光，五行失行，郡国经常发生地震。

同时河南、颍川郡黄河决口，淹死百姓，冲坏屋舍。

朕的德行浅薄。以致百姓遭罪，朕深感恐惧。

已派光禄大夫巡视灾区举其名籍，赐死者棺木之费，每人三千。

令遭受水灾的县邑及其他郡国因灾害减收四成以上，人民资财不满十万的，都免除今年租赋。”

建平元年 (公元前 6 年) 春正月，赦免天下。

侍中骑都尉新成侯赵欣，成阳侯赵皆有罪，废其爵为平民，放徙到辽西。

太皇太后下诏说：“外戚家王氏田地不是冢域场，都交给贫民耕种。”

二月，皇上下诏说：“曾闻圣王得以国泰民安，实以能启用贤才为首。

现诏付大司马、列侯、将军、中二千石、州牧、守、相等举荐孝悌淳直能直言通政事，虽地位低微亦可担任治民之官，每人荐一人。”

三月，赐各侯王、公主、列侯、相、丞相、将军、中二千石、中都官郎吏金钱布帛，各有等差。

冬季，中山孝王太后冯媛、太后弟宜乡侯冯参有罪，全都自杀了。

二年春三月，罢设大司空，恢复御史大夫。

夏季四月，下诏说：“汉家制度，对天子之至亲，当极尊号。

定陶恭皇的号不应再称定陶。

尊恭皇太后为帝太太后，称永信宫；恭皇后为帝太后，称中安宫。

立恭皇庙于京师。

赦免天下被流放的罪犯。”

罢设州牧，恢复刺史。

六月初五日，皇太后丁氏去世。

皇上说：“朕闻夫妇为一体。

《诗》说：‘生则异内外之室，死则同冢墓之穴。’

昔日鲁大夫季武子的寝陵修成后，其妻杜氏之殡在西阶下，子孙请求合葬而得到同意。

附葬之礼，从周朝就兴起了。

孔子说：‘周朝的仪典文章大备啊！我遵循周礼。’

孝子事死者如事生者。

皇太后应起陵于恭皇之陵园。”

于是葬丁太后于定陶。

征集陈留、济阴附近郡国五万人开挖墓穴并进行封土。

待诏夏贺良等作汉高祖为赤帝之精的谶言，说汉家历运中衰，应再受天命，要改元易号。

皇上下诏说：“汉兴二百年，历数开元。

皇天保佑朕这不才之人，汉国再获受命之符，朕的德行菲薄，岂敢不遵！

大凡更受天的大命，必须改制更新，现大赦天下。

以建平二年为太初元年，

号称陈圣刘太平皇帝。

漏刻以一百二十为度。”

七月，以渭城西北原上永陵亭都为初陵。

勿须迁徙郡国居民，使他们能自安。

八月，下诏说：“待诏夏贺良等建议改元易号，增加漏刻，可以使国家长治久安。

朕过于听信贺良等言，希望为四海造福，然而并无什么福祉降临。

他们的建议都是违经背古、逆时而动的。

六月初九日所下诏书，除赦令以外，一律取消。

贺良等反道惑众，交付执法部门处置。”

夏贺良等都伏罪。

丞相朱博、御史大夫赵立、孔乡侯傅宴有罪。

朱博自杀，赵立减死二等论罪，傅宴削减食邑户四分之一。

其事记在《朱博传》中。

三年春正月，立广德夷王弟广汉为广平王。

正月二十一日，皇太后所居桂宫正殿火灾。

三月二十八日，丞相平当去世。

有彗星出现于河鼓间。

夏六月，立鲁顷王子吾阝乡侯闵为王。

冬季十一月初五日，恢复甘泉泰山祭祠、汾阴后土祭祠，取消南北郊祭。

东平王云、云后谒、安成恭侯夫人放都有罪，

云自杀，谒、放都处死。

四年春季，发生大旱灾。

关东民间传行西王母的神机妙算，经历郡国，西入关到长安。

群众又聚集祭祀西王母，有的夜间持火上屋，击鼓号呼互相惊恐。

二月，封帝太太后从弟侍中傅商为汝昌侯，太后同母弟之子侍中郑业为阳信侯。

三月，侍中驸马都尉董贤、光禄大夫息夫躬、南阳太守孙宠都以告发东平王有功而封为列侯，

其事记在《董贤传》中。

夏季五月，赐中二千石至六百石及天下男子爵级。

六月，尊帝太太后为皇太太后。

秋季八月，恭皇园北门发生火灾。

冬季，诏令将军，中二千石举荐熟谙兵法有策谋思虑的人。

元寿元年(公元前2年)春季正月初一，发生日偏食。

皇上下诏说：“朕继承大统，不明不敏，深夜忧劳，无暇宁息。

仍是阳阴不调，百姓不足，不知过错在何处。

屡令公卿，望其励精图治，

至今有关官员执法，没有正确目标，有的残暴凶虐，借势获名，而温良宽柔的人，却受到摧残而亡灭。

因之残贼之风日烈，和睦之气日衰，百姓愁苦怨恨，不知如何立身。

于是正月初一，发生日食，其过不远，责任都由朕承担，

公卿大夫都要尽心尽力为百僚表率，重用仁人，贬黜残贼，以期安定人民。

列举朕的过失，知无不言。

可与将军、列侯、中二千石举荐贤良方正能直言的各一人。

大赦天下。”

大司马卫将军董贤为大司马，丞相孔光为大司徒，御史大夫彭宣为大司空，封长平侯。

正司直、司隶，创置司寇职，未作最后确定。

六月初三日，哀帝驾崩于未央宫。

秋季九月十八日，葬于义陵。

班固评论说：汉哀帝从为藩王到被立为太子，文辞博敏，幼有善闻。

目睹汉成帝时爵禄尽入王家，权柄转入外戚之手，所以哀帝执政屡诛大臣，意图加强主威，以武帝、宣帝为法。

生性不爱声色，有时看看手持角力的武戏。

即位时身患瘘痹之疾，以后逐渐加重，从二十岁起当了六年皇帝就去世了。可惜啊！</div>

          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-ai was the grandson of Emperor Yüan by a concubine and the son of King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang].

At that time the youngest brother of Emperor Ch'eng, King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], also came to pay court, followed [only] by his Tutor.

The Emperor thought it strange, and asked [Liu Hsin, the future Emperor Ai], about it.

The King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu Hsin] replied, "According to the [imperial] ordinances, when vassal kings come to pay court, they are permitted to be accompanied by the [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs in their kingdoms. The Tutor, Chancellor, and Commandant of the Capital are all [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs in a kingdom, hence I am accompanied by them all."

The Emperor ordered him to recite from the Book of Odes, and he understood and was versed in it, and was able to explain it.

On another day, [the Emperor] asked the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], in what law or ordinance [it was ordered that he should be] accompanied only by his tutor, and he was unable to reply.

[The Emperor] ordered him to recite from the Book of History, and he broke off [in the middle of his recitation].

Moreover, [at an imperial feast], when he had been granted food in the presence of [the Emperor], he was the last to finish eating; when he arose, his stockings came down, [for] their ties had become loosened.

Because of these [facts], Emperor Ch'eng considered that he was incapable, and esteemed the King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu Hsin], as capable, often exalting his abilities.

At this time the grandmother of the King, the Queen Dowager [of Ting-t'ao, nee] Fu, had come with the King to pay court, and privately sent presents to the Brilliant Companion [nee] Chao, whom the Emperor favored, and to the Emperor's maternal uncle, the General of Agile Cavalry and Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, Wang Ken.

The Brilliant Companion [nee Chao] and [Wang] Ken saw that the Emperor had no sons, and also wished beforehand to attach themselves [to the coming ruler] by a plan for the distant future, so both in turn praised the King of Ting-t'ao and urged the Emperor to make him his successor.

Emperor Ch'eng of his own volition also exalted [Liu Hsin's] ability, and, after having put the bonnet of virility upon him, sent him [back to his kingdom]. At that time he had [reached] his seventeenth year.

The next year, [the Emperor] sent the Bearer of the Gilded Mace, Jen Hung, as Acting Grand Herald, with credentials, to summon the King of Ting-t'ao to [come and] be established as the Imperial Heir-apparent.

[Liu Hsin however] excused himself, saying, "Your servant has been favored in being permitted to succeed his father in charge of a tributary [kingdom] and to become a vassal king. My ability and nature is inadequate for use as the occupant of the Heir-apparent's palace.

Your Majesty is sage and virtuous, generous and benevolent. [Your Majesty] has respectfully succeeded his ancestors and has upheld and been obedient in the care of the gods in heaven and earth. It is proper that your [Majesty] should receive happiness and blessing thru the reward of`thousands and millions of descendants.'

our servant is willing temporarily to be permitted to remain in the prince's lodge of his kingdom [at the imperial capital], morning and evening to present himself [to your Majesty] to ask [about your Majesty's] health, and to wait until there may be an imperial heir, [whereupon your servant] will return to his kingdom and [remain] in charge of his tributary [state]."

When the memorial was presented, the Son of Heaven replied, "[We] have heard it."

More than a month later, [Emperor Ch'eng] established [Liu] Ching, a grandson of King Hsiao of Ch'u, [Liu Ao], as King of Ting-t'ao, to uphold the sacrifices to King Kung [of Ting-t'ao, Liu K'ang], in order to encourage and incite the Heir-apparent to apply himself solely to the purpose of being [the Emperor's] successor. A discussion is in the "Memoir of the [Imperial] Relatives by Marriage."

In [the period] Sui-ho, the second year, the third month, Emperor Ch'eng died,

and in the fourth month, on [the day] ping-wu, the Heir-apparent took the imperial throne and presented himself in the Temple of [Emperor] Kao.

He honored the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] with the title, Grand August Empress Dowager, and the Empress [nee Chao] with the title, Empress Dowager.

He [granted] a general amnesty to the empire,

granted one quadriga of horses to each king's son of the imperial house who was enregistered, to the officials and common people, noble ranks, to [each] hundred households, an ox and wine, and to the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, silk.

The Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an imperial edict honoring King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang], as Sovereign Kung [of Ting-t'ao].

In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-hsü, [the Emperor] established the Empress nee Fu [as Empress].

An imperial edict said, "[According to the principle of] the Spring and Autumn, [in the Kung-yang Commentary] that`a mother becomes honorable because of her son,' [We] honor the Queen Dowager [nee Fu] of Ting-t'ao with the title, Empress Dowager Kung, and the Concubine [nee] Ting [of Ting-t'ao with the title, Empress Kung, and establish for each an entourage, a Supervisor of the Household, and the income of an estate, like [the occupants of] the Ch'ang-hsin Palace and the Inner Palace."

[We] posthumously honor the father of [the Empress Dowager nee] Fu as the Marquis [through Whom the Emperor] Renders Homage to an Ancestor, and the father of [the Empress nee] Ting as the Marquis in Recompense to his Virtue."

The maternal uncle [of the Emperor], Ting Ming, had been made the Marquis of Yang-an, his maternal uncle's son, [Ting] Man, was made Marquis of Ping-chou,

and [Ting] Man's father, [Ting] Chung, was posthumously [granted] the posthumous name, Marquis Huai of P'ing-chou. The Empress [nee Fu's] father, [Fu] Yen, had become the Marquis of K'ung-hsiang, and the younger brother of the Empress Dowager [nee Chao], the Palace Attendant and Imperial Household Grandee Chao Ch'in, became the Marquis of Hsin-ch'eng.

In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "`The melodies of Cheng are licentious' and bring disorder into music. They were banished by the Sage-kings. Let the Bureau of Music be abolished."

For the Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, [Wang] Ken, who had previously as Commander-in-chief initiated the plan for [the dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, [whereby Emperor Ai had been appointed Heir-apparent], there was added to his enfeoffment [the income of] two thousand households,

and for the Grand Coachman, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun, who had seconded and guided [the Emperor before he was appointed] and had been his former benefactor, there was added to his enfeoffment [the income of] five hundred households. Moreover, for the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, and the Grand Minister of Works, the Marquis of Fan-hsiang, Ho Wu, there was added to each of their enfeoffments [the income of] a thousand households.

An imperial edict said, "The King of Ho-chien, [Liu] Liang, has mourned for his Queen Dowager to the third year and so has become a sign-post to the imperial house. Let his enfeoffment be increased by ten thousand households."

It also said, "`Frugality in expenditure and caution in action,' in order to prevent extravagance and excess, are the first things in government and the unvarying way of all the [true] kings.

[But] the vassal kings, the full marquises, the princesses, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs, together with powerful and rich common people, keep [many] male and female slaves, cultivated fields and residences without limit. They compete with the common people in profitable [enterprises] so the people lose their occupations and suffer severely without enough [to live on].

Let regulations for the restriction [of these matters] be discussed."

The high officials memorialized detailed [regulations as follows], "The vassal kings and full marquises are to be permitted to own private cultivated fields in their states; the privately owned cultivated fields in the prefectures or marches of full marquises who [live] in Ch'ang-an and of princesses and the privately owned cultivated fields of Marquises of the Imperial Domain, officials, and common people are all not to be allowed to exceed thirty ch'ing.

The male and female slaves of the vassal kings [shall be limited to] two hundred persons; those of full marquises and princesses, to a hundred persons; and those of Marquises of the Imperial Domain, officials, and the common people, to thirty persons.

Those [slaves] in their sixtieth year and over or in their tenth year and under are not to be counted in this number.

No merchants are to be allowed to own private cultivated land or become officials. Those who violate [this order] shall be sentenced according to the Code.

Those who [after three years] own private cultivated land or keep male or female slaves more than the [allowed] number, shall all have them confiscated and delivered over the imperial government."

[The production of] those articles in the Three Offices for Garments in the Ch'i [Commandery] and in various offices which weave figured silks and [make] embroidery, which are difficult to produce or are injurious to women's work, were all stopped and [such goods] were not to be made or transported [to the capital].

The ordinance [concerning] the giving of office to a son was done away with, together with the laws about slandering [the government] and calumny.

Palace Maids in the Lateral Courts [of the Wei-yang Palace] who were in their thirtieth year and under were sent out [of the harem] and married off;

government male and female slaves who were in their fiftieth year and above were freed and made commoners.

The prohibition [was made] that the commanderies and kingdoms should not be permitted to present famous wild animals [to the imperial court].

The salaries of officials [ranking at] three hundred piculs and under was increased.

Officials who were oppressive or tyrannical were investigated in order that from time to time they might be dismissed.

The high officials were not permitted to bring up former matters that had happened previous to an amnesty.

When the fathers or mothers of Erudits or their Disciples died, they were given leave for mourning to the third year."

In the autumn, [it was decided that] the Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, Wang Ken, and the Marquis of Ch'eng-tu, Wang K'uang, had both committed crimes; [Wang] Ken went to his estate; [Wang] K'uang was dismissed [from his title] and became a commoner, returning to his native commandery.

An imperial edict said, "Since We have succeeded to the heavy [responsibilities] of the [imperial] ancestral temples, [We] have been trembling and circumspect, fearing that [We] might depart from the will of Heaven.

[But] recently the sun and moon have lost their brilliance, the five planets have lost their paths, and the commanderies and kingdoms have frequently [suffered from] movements of the Earth.

Recently in the Ho-nan and Ying-ch'uan Commanderies, streams have overflowed and have carried away and killed some of the common people, ruining and demolishing their cottages.

[Owing to] Our lack of virtue, the common people have suffered punishment in [Our] place. We have been greatly dismayed

and have already sent an Imperial Household Grandee to travel about, inspect, and report [the names] and registration [in which those who have suffered are located], granting for each dead person three thousand cash for a coffin.

Let it be ordered that in the counties and towns which have been injured by flood, together with those other commanderies and kingdoms which have suffered four-tenths or more from a [calamitous] visitation, the common people whose property does not [amount to] fully 100,000 [cash] shall all not [be required] to pay this year's land-tax or poll-taxes."

In [the period] Chien-p'ing, the first year, in the spring, the first month, an amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

The Palace Attendant and Colonel of Cavalry, the Marquis of Hsin-ch'eng, Chao Ch'in, and the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang, Chao Hsin, who had both committed crimes, were dismissed [from their titles], made commoners, and exiled to the Liao-hsi [Commandery].

The Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an imperial edict that the cultivated fields which had not been [used for] tombs, belonging to the Wang clan who were imperial relatives by marriage, should all be distributed to the poor people.

In the second month, an imperial edict said, "Verily [We] have heard that the Sage-kings, in their government, considered the securing of capable persons as the most important [of matters].

Let [the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, the Grand Minister of Works, Shih Tan], with the Commander-in-chief, [Fu Yen], the full Marquises, the generals, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, the Provincial Shepherds, the Administrators, and the Chancellors each recommend one person who is filially pious, fraternally respectful, true and honest, able to speak frankly, who understands government matters, and has arisen from a mean condition, so is able to love the common people."

In the third month, [the Emperor] granted to the vassal kings, the princesses, the full marquises, the Lieutenant Chancellor, [K'ung Kuang], the generals, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, [officials] in the imperial capital offices, the Gentlemen, and [minor] officials, gold, cash, and silk, to each proportionately.

In the winter, the Queen Dowager, [Feng] Yüan, of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], and her younger brother, the Marquis of Yi-hsiang, Feng Ts'an, who had [been charged with] having committed a crime, both killed themselves.

In the second year, in the spring, the third month, [the title of] Grand Minister of Works was abolished, and [the former title of] Grandee Secretary was restored.

In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial edict said, "The institutes of the Han dynasty stress the favoring of [imperial] relatives in order to manifest the honoring of those who should be honored.

In the title of Sovereign Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang], it is not proper that he should again be called `of Ting-t'ao.'

[We] honor the Empress Dowager Kung [nee Fu] with the title, the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager; she is to be called [the occupant of] the Yung-hsin Palace. The Empress Kung [nee Ting] is to be entitled the Emperor's Empress Dowager; she is to be called [the occupant of] the Chung-an Palace.

There is to be established a Temple to Sovereign Kung in the [imperial] capital."

An amnesty was granted to convicts in the empire.

[The Emperor] abolished the [office of] Provincial Shepherds and reestablished [their occupants as] Inspectors.

In the sixth month, on [the day] keng-shen, the Emperor's Empress Dowager nee Ting died.

The Emperor declared, "We have heard that husband and wife are one flesh.

The Book of Odes says, `When living, we occupy different apartments, But when dead, we shall share the same grave.'

Anciently, When Viscount Wu, Chi-[sun Su], had completed his private apartments, and at the foot of his western steps there was' a corpse of the Tu clan, [the head of that clan] begged permission to bury [the wife of the deceased] together with [her husband],' and `[Chi-sun Su] permitted it.'

The right of associating [husband and wife] in burial arose in the Chou [period].

`How complete and elegant was its culture! I follow the Chou [practises].'

A filial son `serves the dead as he served the living.'

It is proper that for the Emperor's Empress Dowager there should be raised a tumulus in the funerary of King Kung."

She was thereupon buried in [the kingdom of] Ting-t'ao.

Fifty thousand persons from Ch'en-liu, Chi-yin, and neighboring commanderies and kingdoms were mobilized to dig and replace the earth.

The Expectant Appointee Hsia Ho-liang and others spoke of revelations from Ch'ih-ching-tzu that the Han dynasty had come upon [a time of decay in the midst of [the period of time allotted to it] by its destiny, so that it must again receive the Mandate [of Heaven; hence] it was proper that [the Emperor] should change the year-period and alter his title.

The imperial edict said, "The Han [dynasty] arose two hundred years [ago], and many times in succession it has begun [new] year-periods.

August Heaven has sent down its aid to [Us] who have no ability, so that the Han [dynasty's] estate should a second time be permitted to have the portents for receiving the Mandate [of Heaven]. Though We are not virtuous, who [are We that We] should dare not to listen [to the will of Heaven]?

夫基事之元命，必与天下自新，其大赦天下。

Let the second year of [the period] Chien-p'ing become the first year of [the period] T'ai-ch'u-yüan-chiang.

[Let Our] title be the Sovereign Emperor of Great Peacefulness Who Makes Known the Sageness of the Liu [House].

For the graduations on the clepsydra, [let] 120 [graduations per day] be used as the measure of their size."

In the seventh month, on the plain northwest of Wei-ch'eng, in the Yung-ling Commune section [of the prefecture], there was made the Emperor's tomb,

[with the order], "Do not remove the common people from the commanderies and kingdoms [to this place], in order that [the people] may not be disturbed."

In the eighth month, an imperial edict said, "The Expectant Appointee Hsia Ho-ling and others gave advice that [We] should change the year-period, alter [Our] title, and increase the [number of] graduations on the clepsydra, whereby [We] could [secure] permanent peace for the clan [ruling] the state.

We mistakenly listened to the advice of [Hsia] Ho-liang and the others, hoping to obtain blessings for [all] within the [four] seas. [But] in the end there was no happy verification [of their promises];

they have all gone contrary to the Classics, turned their backs on ancient [practises], and are not in accordance with the needs of the times.

The decree of the sixth month and [the day] chia-tzu, except for the order of an amnesty, is all expunged.

[Hsia] Ho-liang and the others have gone contrary to the [right] Way and misled the crowd; they are to be committed [the charge of] the high officials."

They all suffered [death] for their crimes.

The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Chu] Po, the Grandee Secretary, [Chao] Hsüan, and the Marquis of K'ung-hsiang, [Fu] Yen, had committed crimes;

[Chu] Po killed himself, [Chao] Hsüan's death-[penalty] was reduced by three degrees, and [Fu] Yen was sentenced to have one-fourth of the households [in his estate] cut off.

A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Chu] Po."

In the third year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] made [Liu] Kuang-han, the younger brother of King Yi of Kuang-tê, [Liu Yün-k'o], the King of Kuang-p'ing.

On [the day] kuei-mao, there was a fire in the Main Hall of the Kuei Palace where the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu] lived.

In the third month, on [the day] chi-yu, the Lieutenant Chancellor [P'ing] Tang died.

A comet appeared in the [constellation] Ho-ku.

In the summer, the sixth month, [the Emperor] established the Marquis of Wu-hsiang, [Liu] Min, the son of King Ch'ing of Lu, [Liu Feng], as King [of Lu].

In the winter, the eleventh month, on [the day] jen-tzu, [the Emperor] reestablished the Altar to the Supreme [One] at the Kan-ch'üan [Palace] and the Temple to Sovereign Earth at Fen-yin [as places for regular imperial sacrifices] and disestablished [the places in] the southern and northern suburbs [for the suburban sacrifices].

The King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu] Yün, [Liu] Yün's Queen, Yeh, and Fang, the Lady of Marquis Kung of An-ch'eng [Wang Ch'ung], had all committed crimes;

[Liu] Yün killed himself; Yeh and Fang were publicly executed.

In the fourth year, in the spring, [the first month], there was a great drought.

East of the [Han-ku] Pass the common people carried in procession the wands of the Mother Queen of the West. They passed thru commanderies and kingdoms and went west thru the [Han-ku] Pass to the imperial capital.

The common people [there] also collected and sacrificed to the Mother Queen of the West. Some by night took fire up on top of buildings, beat drums, and cried out, exciting and frightening one another.

In the second month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed a younger cousin of the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu], the Palace Attendant, Fu Shang, as Marquis of Ju-ch'ang, and the son of a younger [half]-brother of the [Emperor's Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Fu] by the same mother, the Palace Attendant Cheng Yeh, as Marquis of Yang-hsin.

In the third month, the Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Attendant Cavalry, Tung Hsien, the Imperial Household Grandee, Hsi-fu Kung, and the [former] Grand Administrator of Nan-yang [Commandery], Sun Ch'ung, were all enfeoffed as full marquises because they had informed on the King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu Yün].

A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Tung] Hsien."

In the summer, the fifth month, [the Emperor] granted noble titles to [officials ranking from] fully two thousand piculs to those of six hundred piculs, also to the males of the empire.

In the sixth month, he honored the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu, with the title,] August Grand Empress Dowager.

In the autumn, the eighth month, there was a visitation [of fire] to the North Gate of the Funerary Park for Sovereign Kung, [Liu K'ang].

In the winter, an imperial edict [ordered] the generals and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs to recommend those who understood military affairs and who had great plans [for the empire's future].

In [the period] Yüan-shou, the first year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "We have been permitted to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples, and, [altho We are] neither wise nor clever, [We have] toiled day and night, taking no leisure for repose.

Nevertheless, the Yin and Yang have not been in accord, so that the great multitude do not have enough [to live on]. We have not yet perceived [where lies] the blame for this [state of affairs],

and have frequently [ordered Our] ministers to be attentive [to their duties], expecting that [We] might have hopes [of improvement in the government.

But] to the present, the high officials, in administering the laws, have not yet attained [Our] goal [of good government]. Some esteem oppressiveness and cruelty and utilize the power [of the government] to obtain fame, while gentle and good, magnanimous and forgiving [people] fall into destruction and extinction.

For this reason murderous brigands have increased more and more, while harmony and concord have daily declined, the people are resentful, and have no place to repose themselves.

乃正月朔，日有蚀之，厥咎不远，在余一人。

Let the ministers and grandees each do their utmost and make all efforts to lead the officials, taking care to appoint benevolent persons and to degrade and send far away injurious villains, with the purpose of securing tranquillity for the common people.

They should make Our faults known and not be silent about anything.

Let them, with the generals, the full marquises, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, each recommend one person who is capable and good, sincere and upright, and able to speak frankly.

A general amnesty [is granted to] the empire."

On [the day] ting-szu, the August Grand Empress Dowager nee Fu died.

In the third month, the Lieutenant Chancellor [Wang] Chia who had committed a crime, was sent to prison, where he died.

In the autumn, the ninth month, the Commander-in-chief and General of Agile Cavalry, Ting Ming, was dismissed.

The bronze tortoise and snake door-knocker heads on the gate to the Hall in the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-yüan cried out.

In the second year, in the spring, the first month, the Shan-yü of the Huns and the Greater K'un-mi of the Wu-sun came to pay court.

In the second month, they returned to their states. The Shan-yü was not pleased.

A discussion is in the "Memoir of the Huns."

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] jen-hsu, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the fifth month, [the titles of] the three highest ministers were corrected and their duties divided:

the Commander-in-chief and General of the Guard, Tung Hsien, became the Commander-in-chief; the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, became the Grand Minister of the Masses; and the Grandee Secretary, P'eng Hsüan, became the Grand Minister of Works. [The latter] was enfeoffed as Marquis of Ch'ang-p'ing.

The duties of the Director of Uprightness and the Director of the Retainers were to be corrected, and a Minister of Brigands was to be created.

Before the matter was settled, in the sixth month, on [the day] mou-wu, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Palace.

In the autumn, the tenth month, on [the day] jen-yin, he was buried in the Yi Tomb.

In eulogy we say: When [Emperor] Hsiao-ai was a tributary king and then entered the palace of the Heir-apparent, his vocabulary was large and intelligent, [so that even when] he was young, he [had already] obtained a good renown.

He observed the period of [Emperor] Hsiao-ch'eng, when `blessings left the' imperial `house' and [the Emperor's] power was transferred to his maternal [relatives]. For this reason, when [Emperor Ai] attended court, he frequently executed his great officials, seeking to strengthen the might of the ruler and to imitate [Emperors] Wu and Hsüan.

In his nature he did not care for music or women. At times he watched boxing, archery, and military sports.

When he ascended the throne, he had arthritis, and in his latter years [his arthritis] gradually became worse. He did not long enjoy the rule. How sad!</div>
