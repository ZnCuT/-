其与列侯议定奏之。”

丞相臣平言：“谨与绛侯臣勃、曲周侯臣商、颍阴侯臣婴、安国侯臣陵等议：列侯幸得赐餐钱奉邑，陛下加惠，以功次定朝位，臣请臧高庙。”

今皇帝疾久不已，乃失惑昏乱，不能继嗣奉宗庙，守祭祀，不可属天下。

其议代之。”

时齐悼惠王子朱虚侯章在京师，以禄女为妇，知其谋，乃使人告兄齐王，令发兵西。

章欲与太尉勃、丞相平为内应，以诛诸吕。

齐王遂发兵，又诈琅邪王泽发其国兵，并将而西。

产、禄等遣大将军灌婴将兵击之。

婴至荥阳，使人谕齐王与连和，待吕氏变而共诛之。

太尉勃与丞相平谋，以曲周侯郦商子寄与禄善，使人劫商令寄绐说禄曰：“高帝与吕后共定天下，刘氏所立九王，吕氏所立三王，皆大臣之议。

事已布告诸侯王，诸侯王以为宜。

今太后崩，帝少，足下不急之国守籓，乃为上将将兵留此，为大臣诸侯所疑。

何不速归将军印，以兵属太尉，请梁王亦归相国印，与大臣盟而之国？

齐兵必罢，大臣得安，足下高枕而王千里，此万世之利也。”

禄然其计，使人报产及诸吕老人。

或以为不便，计犹豫未有所决。

禄信寄，与俱出游，过其姑吕嬃。

嬃怒曰：“汝为将而弃军，吕氏今无处矣！”

乃悉出珠玉、宝器散堂下，曰：“无为它人守也！”

八月庚申，平阳侯窋行御史大夫事，见相国产计事。

郎中令贾寿使从齐来，因数产曰：“王不早之国，今虽欲行，尚可得邪？”

具以灌婴与齐、楚合从状告产。

平阳侯窋闻其语，驰告丞相平、太尉勃。

勃欲入北军，不得入。

襄平侯纪通尚符节，乃令持节矫内勃北军。

勃复令郦寄、典客刘揭说禄，曰：“帝使太尉守北军，欲令足下之国，急归将印，辞去。

不然，祸且起。”

禄遂解印属典客，而以兵授太尉勃。

勃入军门，行令军中曰：“为吕氏右袒，为刘氏左袒。”

军皆左袒。

勃遂将北军。

然尚有南军，丞相平召朱虚侯章佐勃。

勃令章监军门，令平阳侯告卫尉，毋内相国产殿门。

产不知禄已去北军，入未央宫欲为乱。

殿门弗内，徘徊往来。

平阳侯驰语太尉勃，勃尚恐不胜，未敢诵言诛之，乃谓朱虚侯章曰：“急入宫卫帝。”

餔时，遂击产，产走。

天大风，从官乱，莫敢斗者。

大臣相与阴谋，以为少帝及三弟为王者皆非孝惠子，复共诛之，尊立文帝。

语在周勃、高五王《传》。

赞曰：孝惠、高后之时，海内得离战国之苦，君臣俱欲无为，故惠帝拱己，高后女主制政，不出房闼，而天下晏然，刑罚罕用，民务稼穑，衣食滋殖。</div>

          <div class="txt">高皇后吕氏，生惠帝。

辅助汉高祖平定天下，她的父兄在高祖时封侯的有三人。

惠帝继位之后，尊奉吕后为太后。

太后立惠帝之姊鲁元公主的女儿为皇后，无子，就将后宫美人所生之子立为太子。

惠帝驾崩，太子立为皇帝，皇帝年幼，吕太后临朝行天子事，大赦天下。

随后封其兄之子吕台、吕产、吕禄及吕台之子吕通四人为王，封诸吕六人为列侯。

其具体事见《汉书·外戚传》。

朕考虑到将来会因年代久远而功名无人记得，无以尊崇大义，传之后世。

现在朕想以各位列侯功劳的大小排定在朝中的地位，将功劳簿藏于高皇帝的祠庙之中，代代相传，其子孙世袭其功劳与爵位。

请大家与列侯共同提出议案上报。”

丞相陈平上奏：“臣与绛侯周勃、曲周侯郦商、阴侯灌婴、安国侯王陵等共议，列侯蒙恩得赏租俸与食邑，陛下又格外加恩，以功劳高下定等级，臣等请将功劳簿藏于高庙。”

吕后批准此奏。

春正月二十七日，发生地震，武都道发生山崩。

夏六月三十日，出现日偏蚀。

秋七月，恒山王刘不疑去世。

重新使用八铢钱。

吕后三年（公元前185年）夏，长江、汉水泛滥，淹没民舍四千余家。

秋季，星星在白天出现。

吕后四年（公元前184年）夏，少帝私下知道自己不是皇后亲生，口出怨言。皇太后将他软禁于长巷之中。

下诏说：“凡是统驭天下治理万民的人，胸怀应像上天那样包罗，像大地那样容纳；皇上从爱护百姓出发以治理百姓，百姓心悦诚服方能尊奉皇上，上下一心才能国泰民安。

当今少帝疾病长期不愈，甚至神经错乱，不能继承大统与奉祀宗庙及镇守社稷，不能够担当天下的重任。

请提议可以替代他的人。”

群臣都说：“皇太后是从国家根本利益考虑的，这对于宗庙社稷的稳定至关重要。臣等俯首奉诏。”

五月十七日，立恒山王弘为皇帝。

吕后五年（公元前183年）春，南粤王尉佗自称南武帝。

任命梁王吕产为丞相，赵王吕禄为上将军。

立营陵侯刘泽为琅琊王。

夏五月十九日，下诏说：“昭灵夫人，是太上皇妃；武哀侯、宣夫人，是高皇帝的兄及姊。谥号与身份不相称，请另议谥号。”

丞相陈平等请尊昭灵夫人为昭灵后，武哀侯为武安王，宣夫人为昭哀后。

六月，赵王刘恢自杀。

秋九月，燕王刘建去世。

南越侵盗长沙，派遣隆虑侯周灶领兵驱逐。

宫中的宦官、主管宦官的令丞都赐爵关内侯，并食其邑的租税。

夏季，江水、汉水泛滥，冲毁一万余家。

秋季七月三十日，皇太后———吕后驾崩于未央宫。

遗诏赐给各侯王各千金，将相列侯下至郎吏按级分赐。

大赦天下。

上将军吕禄、丞相吕产专擅军政大权。自知违背高皇帝的“非有功而侯”的规定，恐为大臣及各侯王所害，因此阴谋作乱。

此时齐悼惠王之子朱虚侯刘章在京都，他是吕禄的女婿，知晓了阴谋，就立即派人告知其兄齐王，要他发兵西进。

刘章准备与太尉周勃、丞相陈平为内应，以诛除诸吕。

齐王于是起兵，又策动琅王牙王刘泽调动其国之兵，会师西进。

吕产、吕禄等派大将军灌婴领兵阻击。

灌婴至荥阳，派人告知齐王并与之联合，等待吕氏发动政变时再进行诛讨。

太尉周勃与丞相陈平相谋，认为曲周侯郦商之子寄与吕禄关系密切，就派人强迫郦商令其子郦寄去骗吕禄道：“高帝与吕后共定天下，刘氏所立九王，吕氏所立三王，这都是通过大臣们讨论的。

讨论及决定都已经通报各侯王，各侯王都表示赞同。

今日太后崩驾，皇帝年少，各位不急于到自己的封国自守，却以上将军身份拥兵留京都，以致引起大臣与侯王们的猜疑。

何不立即交还将军印，将兵权传给太尉，请梁王吕产也归还相印，和大臣们交代清楚后回到封国去？

这样齐兵就可以后撤，大臣们也就可以放心，而足下高枕在千里之国称王，这才是万世之利啊！”

吕禄同意了他的计策，派人转告吕产及吕氏父老。

有的以为不安，众说纷纭未作决断。

吕禄相信郦寄，与他一道去劝说诸吕，到了吕后之妹吕须女家。

吕须女怒道：“你作为大将军却放弃军权，吕氏将死无葬身之地了。”

就尽数取出珠玉宝器弃于堂下，她说：“我不必为别人保管这些东西了！”

八月，平阳侯曹纜担任御史大夫，会见相国吕产商计国事。

郎中令贾寿使齐归来，因而指责吕产说：“您不早日到自己的封国去，现在想走还能走吗？”

具体地将灌婴与齐、楚联合的情况告诉吕产。

平阳侯曹纜听到后，急忙告知丞相陈平与太尉周勃。

勃想进入北军，结果未成功。

襄平侯纪通主管符节，就以天子的名义假传军令让周勃入营主持北军。

周勃又派郦寄、典客刘揭劝说吕禄，他们说：“皇上派太尉接管北军。想让各位都回到封国去，应将将军印辞职离开。

不然就要大祸临头。”

吕禄就解下大将军印交给刘揭，而将兵权移交给太尉周勃。

周勃进入中军帐，传令军中说：“支持吕氏的右袒，支持刘氏的左袒。”

将士都左袒。

周勃于是掌握了北军。

但是尚有南军，丞相陈平召朱虚侯刘章协助周勃。

周勃派刘章监守军门，派平阳侯通知卫尉，不要让相国吕产进入殿门。

吕产不知吕禄已失去对北军的控制权，想进入未央宫发动政变。

殿门守军不让他进去，他在殿外来回徘徊。

平阳侯立即转报太尉周勃，周勃尚恐难以取胜，未敢公开宣布诛杀吕氏，就对朱虚侯刘章说：“迅速入宫保卫皇帝。”

刘章请周勃拨兵千人，入未央宫侧门，见吕产在廷中走动。

日午时，就对吕产发起攻击，吕产逃走。

此时狂风陡起，吕产的随从大乱，没有人敢进行抵抗。

刘章领兵追逐吕产，赶到郎中府吏厕中将他杀了。

刘章已杀吕产，汉帝派近侍持皇上符节慰劳刘章。

刘章想夺节，近侍不肯，刘章就与近侍一同乘车，持着皇上符节驰入长乐宫斩杀长乐宫卫尉吕更始。

刘章回到北军，将情况回报于周勃。

周勃起立拜谢并祝贺刘章，他说：“最害怕的是吕产，现在吕产已经被诛，天下就可定了。”

辛酉日，斩吕禄，用鞭杖打死吕嬃。

分遣人马捕捉诸吕男女，不分老少一律斩杀。

大臣们相互进行私谋，认为少帝及他的三个为王的弟弟都不是惠帝的儿子，就一起杀掉，尊立文帝。

其事记在《汉书·周勃、高五王传》中。

班固评论：汉孝惠帝、高后之时，天下脱离战乱之苦，君臣都想无为而治，所以惠帝垂拱以安天下，高后以妇女主持朝政，不出宫门而天下安泰，刑罚少用，百姓也能专注于耕种，从而丰衣足食。</div>

          <div class="txt">The Empress née Lü of [Emperor] Kao-[tsu] gave birth to Emperor Hui.

and assisted Kao-tsu in subjugating the empire. Her father and two older brothers were enfeoffed by Kao-tsu as marquises.

When Emperor Hui took the throne, he honored the Empress [née] Lü by making her Empress Dowager.

The Empress Dowager had made the daughter of the Emperor [Hui's] older sister, the Princess Yüan of Lu, the Empress, [but] she had no issue. [So the Empress Dowager] took the son of a Beauty from the [imperial] harem, pronounced him [the son of the Empress] and made him Heir-apparent.

When Emperor Hui died, the Heir-apparent was made Emperor. He was young, [hence] the Empress Dowager appeared in court and pronounced [that she issued] the [imperial] decrees. A general amnesty [was granted] to the world.

Moreover she established [some] sons of her older brothers, Lü T'ai, [Lü] Ch'an, [Lü] Lu, and [Lü] T'ai's son, [Lü] T'ung, four persons [in all], as kings. She enfeoffed six persons of the Lü [clan] as marquises.

An account is in the "Memoir of the Relatives [of the Imperial House] by Marriage."

In the first year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict said, "At a previous time Emperor Hsiao-hui said that he wanted to abolish the punishment of [death together with] the three [sets of] relatives and the ordinance against monstrous talking, [but] his deliberations had not yet been concluded when he died. Now We abolish these [punishments]."

In the second month she granted noble ranks to the common people, one step to each household.

For the first time there were established Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and [Diligent] Cultivators of the Soil—[each official ranking as] two thousand piculs [recommended] one [such] person [for appointment].

In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] ping-shen, in the palace of the King of Chao, there was a visitation [of fire] in the Ts'ung-t'ai.

[The Empress Dowager] appointed some sons of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui by [women of] his harem: [Lü] Ch'iang as King of Huai-yang, [Lü] Pu-yi as King of Heng-shan, [Lü] Hung as Marquis of Hsiang-ch'eng, [Lü] Ch'ao as Marquis of Chih, and [Lü] Wu as Marquis of Hu-kuan.

In the autumn, the peach and plum [trees] blossomed.

In the second year, an imperial edict said, "The Emperor Kao-[tsu] reformed and ordered the world. All those who distinguished themselves received a share of its territory and were made marquises. All the people [are enjoying] great peace; not one but has received of his bountiful virtue.

We have been thinking and reflecting [on this matter]. If, down to the distant future, their merits and names have not been made manifest, there will be nothing to honor their great conceptions and exhibit them [for the benefit of] later generations.

Now [We] wish to classify and rank the merits of the marquises, so as to determine upon their positions in the court and preserve them in the Temple of Kao-[tsu] from generation to generation without end, so that their heirs may each inherit their merits and positions.

Let [this matter] be discussed with the marquises, settled, and memorialized [to Us]."

[The reply was,] "The Lieutenant Chancellor your subject [Ch'en] P'ing [says that] together with the Marquis of Chiang your subject [Chou] P'o, the Marquis of Ch'ü-chou your subject [Li] Shang, the Marquis of Ying-yin your subject [Kuan] Ying, the Marquis of An-kuo your subject [Wang] Ling, [I have] carefully discussed [this matter]. The marquises have been fortunate [enough] to obtain grants of money for food and to have been appointed to [the income of] towns. Your Majesty is increasing your favors to them by fixing their positions in the court in accordance with their merit. Your subjects beg that [this record] be stored in the Temple of Kao-[tsu]."

The memorial was allowed.

In the spring, the first month, on [the day] yi-mao, there was an earthquake in Ch'iang-tao. In the Wu-tu [Commandery] a mountain fell down.

In the summer, in the sixth month, on the [day] ping-hsü, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of Heng-shan, [Lü] Pu-yi, died.

The "eight shu" cash were put into circulation.

In the third year, in the summer, the Yangtze River [and the Han River] overflowed, carrying away more than four thousand families of common people.

In the autumn, a star appeared in daytime.

In the fourth year, in the summer, the Young Emperor himself knew that he was not the son of the Empress, and emitted some resentful words, [so] the Empress Dowager shut him up in the Yung-hsiang.

The imperial edict said, "Whoever possesses the world and rules all its people covers them like Heaven and supports them like Earth. When the superior has a joyous heart in employing his subjects, the subjects rejoice in serving their superior; when the joy and the rejoicing meet each other, the world is in peace and good order.

Now the Emperor has been ill for a long time and has not recovered; consequently [his mind] is lost and wandering, [and he has become] demented and confused; he is not able to succeed as an heir [to his ancestors], to perform [his duty] in the ancestral temples, nor to continue its sacrifices. He is not able to be entrusted with the empire.

Let it be discussed who should take his place."

The ministers all said, "The plans the Empress Dowager [has made] for the world whereby to maintain the [dynasty's] ancestral temples and the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains are very profound. We knock our heads on the ground [in respect] as we accept [your Majesty's] edict."

In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-ch'en, [the Empress Dowager] made the King of Heng-shan, [Lü] Hung, the Emperor.

In the fifth year, in the spring, the King of Nan-yüeh, Commandant [Chao] T'o, called himself Emperor Wu of Nan-[yüeh].

In the autumn, the eighth month, the King of Huai-nan, [Lü] Ch'iang, died.

In the ninth month, [the Empress Dowager] sent cavalry from the Ho-tung and the Shang-tang [Commanderies] to garrison the Pei-ti [Commandery].

In the sixth year, in the spring, a star was visible in daytime.

In the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty was granted to the world.

and [the Empress Dowager] ranked the prefect of Ch'ang-ling at two thousand piculs.

In the sixth month a wall was built [around] Ch'ang-ling.

The Huns pillaged Ti-tao and attacked O-yang.

The "five fen" cash were put into circulation.

In the seventh year, in the winter, the twelfth month, the Huns pillaged Ti-tao and abducted more than two thousand people.

In the spring, the first month, on [the day] ting-ch'ou, the King of Chao, [Liu] Yu, died from being imprisoned in the princes' lodgings at the capital.

and on [the day] chi-ch'ou, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse and it was total.

[The Empress Dowager] made the King of Liang, Lü Ch'an, the Chancellor of State, and the King of Chao, [Lü] Lu, the First [Ranking] General.

She established the Marquis of Ying-ling, Liu Tse, as the King of Lang-ya.

In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] hsin-wei, an imperial edict said, "Lady Chao-ling was the wife of the Grand Emperor. The Wu-ai Marquis, [Liu Po], and Lady Hsüan were the Emperor Kao-[tsu's] older brother and older sister. Their titles and posthumous names are not adequate [to their stations]. Let it be discussed [what] titles [they should be] honored [with]."

The reply was, "The Lieutenant Chancellor, your subject, [Ch'en] P'ing, and others beg that you honor the Lady Chao-ling with the title, the Empress Chao-ling, the Wu-ai Marquis with the title King Wu-ai, and Lady Hsüan with the title Queen Chao-ai."

In the sixth month, the King of Chao, [Liu] K'uei, committed suicide.

In the autumn, the ninth month, the King of Yen, [Liu] Chien, died.

[The state of] Nan-yüeh invaded and pillaged the [kingdom of] Ch'ang-sha. [The Empress Dowager] sent the Marquis of Lung-lu, [Chou] Tsao, with troops, to attack [the invaders].

In the eighth year, in the spring, the Palace Internuncio Chang Shih-ch'ing was appointed a marquis.

The officials in the eunuch's offices in the [palace] inner [courts] who were chiefs or assistants were all granted the rank of Kuan-nei Marquis with [the income of] estates.

and in the summer, the Yangtze and Han Rivers overflowed, carrying away more than ten thousand families.

In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-szu, the Empress Dowager died at the Wei-yang Palace.

By her testamentary edict she granted to each of the vassal kings [the equivalent of] a thousand [catties of] gold, to the generals, the chancellors, the marquises, and those of lower [rank], down to the Gentlemen and the officials, to each proportionately.

A general amnesty was granted to the world.

The First [Ranking] General, [Lü] Lu, and the Chancellor of State, [Lü] Ch'an, had sole command of the troops and controlled the government. They themselves knew [that they were acting] contrary to the covenant [made by] Emperor Kao-[tsu and his associates], and were fearful that they would be executed by the great officials and the vassal kings. Hence they plotted sedition.

At that time the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, the son of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], was at the capital. Because the daughter of [Lü] Lu was his wife, he knew of their plot, so sent people to inform his older brother, the King of Ch'i, [Liu Hsiang], and induce him to mobilize his troops and come westwards.

[Liu] Chang, with the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, and the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, intended to cooperate from within [the capital] to execute the Lü [clan].

The King of Ch'i thereupon mobilized his troops and also tricked the King of Lang-ya, [Liu] Tse, into mobilizing the troops of his kingdom; [the King of Ch'i] united the [troops of Lang-ya with his own troops] and led them westwards.

[Lü] Ch'an, [Lü] Lu and the others sent the General-in-chief, Kuan Ying, with troops, to attack him.

When [Kuan] Ying reached Jung-yang, he sent people to inform the King of Ch'i that he was going to ally himself with him, waiting until the Lü clan made a move, and then they would all together execute them.

The Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, together with the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, plotted, making use [of the fact that Li] Chi, the son of the Marquis of Ch'ü-chou, Li Shang, was on good terms with [Lü] Lu, and sent people who kidnapped [Li] Shang and ordered [Li] Chi to speak falsely to [Lü] Lu, saying, "Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the Empress [née] Lü together subjugated the world. The establishing of the nine kings from the Liu clan and of the three kings from the Lü clan was a matter all [done as a result of] deliberation by the great officials.

when announcement and information [was made] to the vassal kings, the vassal kings considered it suitable.

Now the Empress Dowager is dead, and the Emperor is young. If your honor does not quickly go [away] to your kingdom and act as a feudatory, but remain here as First [Ranking] General directing your troops, you will be suspected by the great officials and the nobles.

Why do you not quickly return your general's seal, turn over your troops to the Grand Commandant, ask the King of Liang, [Lü Ch'an], also to return the Chancellor of State's seal, make a solemn oath with the great officials, and then go to your kingdoms?

[Then] the troops of Ch'i will certainly be disbanded, the great officials will be at rest, your honor will sleep soundly, and you will rule as king over [a region of] a thousand li. This [act] would be a benefit for ten thousand generations."

[Lü] Lu agreed to his plan and sent people to inform [Lü] Ch'an together with the elders of the Lü [clan].

Some thought it disadvantageous. While they deliberated and hesitated and had not resolved upon anything.

[Lü] Lu, who had confidence in [Li] Chi, went out on a trip together with him, and passed by [the house of] his paternal aunt, Lü Hsü.

[Lü] Hsü became angry and said, "You have been made a general, yet you abandon your army. The Lü clan will now have no [place] to dwell."

Then she took out all her pearls, jade, and precious objects, and scattered them around below the [main] hall, saying, "I will not keep them for others [to enjoy]."

In the eighth month, on [the day] keng-shen, the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao] Cho, who was performing the duties of the Grandee Secretary, visited the Chancellor of State, [Lü] Ch'an, concerning the [yearly] accounts.

The Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Chia Shou, had come from Ch'i, [to which he had been sent as] an envoy, and took advantage [of the opportunity] to reprove [Lü] Ch'an, saying, "You, King, have not quickly gone to your kingdom; now even though you should want to go, would it be still possible?"

[Then] he described and told [Lü] Ch'an all about Kuan Ying uniting as an accomplice with [the kingdoms of] Ch'i and Ch'u.

When the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao] Cho, heard his speech, he galloped [off] and informed the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, and the Grand Commandant, Chou P'o.

[Chou] P'o wanted to enter [the camp of] the Northern Army, but was not permitted to enter.

The Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, Chi T'ung-[chia], was Master of the Credentials, so [Chou P'o] ordered him to [get and] bear a credential which would fraudulently admit [Chou] P'o to the Northern Army.

[Chou] P'o next ordered Li Chi and the Director of Guests, Liu Chieh, to say to [Lü] Lu, "The Emperor has sent the Grand Commandant to take charge of the Northern Army. He intends to order your honor to go to your state. Hasten to return your general's seal, resign, and leave.

If you do not do so, misfortune will immediately come of it."

[Lü] Lu thereupon took off his seal, confided it to the Director of Guests, and thus handed his troops over to the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o.

[Chou] P'o entered the gate of the Army's [encampment] and issued his orders in the Army, saying, "Those who are for the Lü clan bare the right [arm]; those who are for the Liu clan bare the left [arm]."

In the Army [the soldiers] all bared their left [arms].

Thereupon [Chou] P'o took control of the Northern Army.

However there was still the Southern Army. The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, summoned the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, to assist [Chou] P'o.

[Chou] P'o ordered [Liu] Chang to superintend the gates of the army's [encampment] and ordered the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao Cho], to inform the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards not to admit the Chancellor of State [Lü] Ch'an at the gate of the [Front] Hall.

[Lü] Ch'an did not know that [Lü] Lu had already given up the Northern Army, [so] entered the Wei-yang Palace, intending to create a sedition.

[but the guards at] the gate of the [Front] Hall would not admit him. As he walked back and forth irresolutely.

The Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao Cho], galloped [off] and told the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o still feared that [his party] would not be victorious, [so] dared not yet make a public announcement to execute him, but spoke to the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, saying, "Hasten into the Palace to guard the Emperor."

[Liu] Chang asked [Chou] P'o for a thousand soldiers, and entered the Wei-yang Palace by a side gate. He met [Lü] Ch'an in the court.

It was late afternoon. Thereupon he attacked [Lü] Ch'an, and [Lü] Ch'an fled.

[There came] a great wind from Heaven and his retinue became panic-stricken, [so that] none of them dared to fight.

[with the result that Liu Chang] pursued [Lü] Ch'an and killed him in the privy of the official's house connected with the office of the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace.

When [Liu] Chang had killed [Lü] Ch'an, the Emperor ordered an Internuncio, bearing a credential, to congratulate [Liu] Chang.

[Liu] Chang wished to take his credential [from him, but] the Internuncio was unwilling [to part with it]. Then [Liu] Chang went with him in his carriage. By using his credential [as] a passport [allowing him entrance], he galloped [to the Ch`ang-lo Palace] and beheaded the Commandant of the [Palace] Guard at the Chang-lo [Palace], Lü Keng-shih.

He returned, entered the Northern Army, and reported back to the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o.

[Chou] P'o arose, bowed to [Liu] Chang in congratulation, and said, "The only one I was worried about was [Lü] Ch'an. Now that he has been executed the empire has been made stable [again]."

On [the day] hsin-yu, they killed [Lü] Lu and beat to death Lü Hsü.

Dividing themselves into detachments, they arrested all the Lü clan, male and female, without [making any distinction of] youth or age, and beheaded them all.

The great officials and chancellors planned together secretly; because they considered that the Young Emperor and the kings his three younger brothers were all [in reality] not sons of [the Emperor] Hsiao-hui, [the great officials and chancellors] together executed them and honored and established Emperor Wen [upon the throne].

An account [of all the foregoing] is in the "Memoir of Chou P'o" and the "[Memoir of] the Five Kings [who were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]."

In eulogy we say: During the times of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], the world had succeeded in putting behind it the sufferings [during the period of] Contending States. Both ruler and subjects sought for effortlessness. Hence although Emperor Hui folded his hands and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], a female lord, assumed the rule and governed without going out of the doors to her apartments, yet the world was quiet, [mutilating] punishments and [other] penalties were seldom used, the people were busy in sowing and harvesting, and clothing and food multiplied and were abundant.</div>
