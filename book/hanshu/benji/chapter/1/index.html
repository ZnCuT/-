          <div class="txt">孝元皇帝，宣帝太子也。

母曰共哀许皇后，宣帝微时生民间。

年二岁，宣帝即位。

八岁，立为太子。

壮大，柔仁好儒。

见宣帝所用多文法吏，以刑名绳下，大臣杨恽、盖宽饶等坐刺讥辞语为罪而诛，尝侍燕从容言：“陛下持刑太深，宜用儒生。”

宣帝作色曰：“汉家自有制度，本以霸王道杂之，奈何纯任德教，用周政乎！

且俗儒不达时宜，好是古非今，使人眩于名实，不知所守，何足委任？”

乃叹曰：“乱我家者，太子也！”

由是疏太子而爱淮阳王，曰：“淮阳王明察好法，宜为吾子。”

而王母张婕妤尤幸。

上有意欲用淮阳王代太子，然以少依许氏，俱从微起，故终不背焉。

黄龙元年十二月，宣帝崩。

癸巳，太子即皇帝位，谒高庙。

尊皇太后曰太皇太后，皇后曰皇太后。

初元元年春正月辛丑，孝宣皇帝葬杜陵。

赐诸侯王、公主、列侯黄金，吏二千石以下钱、帛，各有差。

大赦天下。

三月，封皇太后兄侍中中郎将王舜为安平侯。

夏四月，诏曰：“朕承先帝之圣绪，获奉宗宙，战战兢兢。

间者地数动而未静，惧于天地之戒，不知所由。

方田作时，朕忧蒸庶之失业，临遣光禄大夫褒等十二人循行天下，存问耆老、鳏、寡、孤、独、困乏、失职之民，延登贤俊，招显侧陋，因览风俗之化。

相、守二千石诚能正躬劳力，宣明教化，以亲万姓，则六合之内和亲，庶几虖无忧矣。

《书》不云乎？‘股肱良哉，庶事康哉！’

布告天下，使明知朕意。”

又曰：“关东今年谷不登，民多困乏。

其令郡国被灾害甚者毋出租赋。

江、海、陂、湖、园、池属少府者以假贫民，勿租赋。

秋八月，上郡属国降胡万余人亡入匈奴。

九月，关东郡国十一大水，饥，或人相食，转旁郡钱、谷以相救。

诏曰：“间者，阴阳不调，黎民饥寒，无以保治，惟德浅薄，不足以充入旧贯之居。

其令诸宫、馆希御幸者勿缮治，太仆减谷食马，水衡省肉食兽。”

二年春正月，行幸甘泉，郊泰畤。

今朕恭承天地，托于公侯之上，明不能烛，德不能绥，灾异并臻，连年不息。

乃二月戊午，地震于陇西郡，毁落太上皇庙殿壁木饰，坏败豲道县城郭官寺及民室屋，压杀人众。

山崩地裂，水泉涌出。

天惟降灾，震惊朕师。

治有大亏，咎至于斯。

夙夜兢兢，不通大变，深惟郁悼，未知其序。

间者岁数不登，元元困乏，不胜饥寒，以陷刑辟，朕甚闵之。

郡国被地动灾甚者，无出租赋。

赦天下。

有可蠲除、减省以便万姓者，条秦，毋有所讳。

丞相、御史、中二千石举茂材异等、直言极谏之士，朕将亲览焉。”

夏四月丁巳，立皇太子。

已诏吏虚仓廪，开府库振救，赐寒者衣。

一年中地再动。

北海水溢，流杀人民。

阴阳不和，其咎安在？

其赐爵关内侯，食邑八百户，朝朔、望。”

十二月，中书令弘恭、石显等谮望之，令自杀。

三年春，令诸侯相位在郡守下。

珠厓郡山南县反，博谋群臣。

待诏贾捐之以为宜弃珠厓，救民饥馑。

乃罢珠厓。

夏四月乙未晦，茂陵白鹤馆灾。”

诏曰：“乃者火灾降于孝武园馆，朕战栗恐惧。

不烛变异，咎在朕躬。

群司又未肯极言朕过，以至于斯，将何以寤焉！

百姓仍遭凶厄，无以相振，加以烦扰虖苛吏，拘牵乎微文，不得永终性命，朕甚闵焉。

其赦天下。”

夏，旱。

立长沙炀王弟宗为王。

封故海昏侯贺子代宗为侯。

六月，诏曰：“盖闻安民之道，本由阴阳。

间者阴阳错谬，风雨不时。

朕之不德，庶几群公有敢言朕之过者，今则不然。

偷合苟从，未肯极言，朕甚闵焉。

惟烝庶之饥寒，远离父母、妻子，劳于非业之作，卫于不居之宫，恐非所以佐阴阳之道也。

其罢甘泉、建章宫卫，令就农。

百官各省费。

条奏毋有所讳。

有司勉之，毋犯四时之禁。

元元失望，上感皇天，阴阳为变，咎流万民，朕甚惧之。

乃者关东连遭灾害。

饥寒疾疫，夭不终命。

《诗》不云乎，‘凡民有丧，匍匐救之。’

其令太官毋日杀，所具各减半。

乘舆秣马，无乏正事而已。

罢角抵、上林宫、馆希御幸者、齐三服官、北假田官、盐铁官、常平仓。

博士弟子毋置员，以广学者。

三月，诏曰：“五帝、三王任贤使能，以登至平，而今不治者，岂斯民异哉？

咎在朕之不明，亡以知贤也。

是故壬人在位，而吉士雍蔽。

重以周、秦之弊，民渐薄俗，去礼义，触刑法，岂不哀哉！

由此观之，元元何辜？

其赦天下，令厉精自新，各务农亩。

无田者皆假之，贷种、食如贫民。

赐吏六百石以上爵五大夫，勤事吏二级，民一级，女子百户牛、酒，鳏、寡、孤、独、高年帛。”

是月雨雪，陨霜伤麦稼，秋罢。

二年春二月，诏曰：“盖闻唐、虞象刑而民不犯，殷周法行而奸轨服。

今朕获承高祖之洪业，托位公侯之上，夙夜战栗，永惟百姓之急，未尝有忘焉。

然而阴阳未调，三光晻昧。

元元大困，流散道路，盗贼并兴。

有司又长残贼，失牧民之术。

是皆朕之不明，政有所亏。

咎至于此，朕甚自耻。

为民父母，若是之薄，谓百姓何？

其大赦天下，赐民爵一级，女子百户牛、酒，鳏、寡、孤、独、高年、三老、孝弟、力田帛。”

又赐诸侯王、公主、列侯黄金，中二千石以下至中都官长吏各有差，吏六百石以上爵五大夫，勤事吏各二级。

三月壬戌朔，日有蚀之。

诏曰：“朕战战栗栗，夙夜思过失，不敢荒宁。

惟阴阳不调，未烛其咎，娄敕公卿，日望有效。

至今有司执政，未得其中，施与禁切，未合民心，暴猛之俗弥长，和睦之道日衰，百姓愁苦，靡所错躬。

是以氛邪岁增，侵犯太阳，正气湛掩，日久夺光。

乃壬戌，日有蚀之，天见大异，以戒朕躬，朕甚悼焉。

其令内郡国举茂材异等、贤良、直言之士各一人。”

夏六月，诏曰：“间者连年不收，四方咸困。

元元之民，劳于耕耘，又亡成功，困于饥馑，亡以相救。

四年春二月，诏曰：“朕承至尊之重，不能烛理百姓，娄遭凶咎。

加以边境不安，师旅在外，赋敛、转输，元元骚动，穷困亡聊，犯法抵罪。

其赦天下，所贷贫民勿收责。”

诏曰：“盖闻明王在上，忠贤布职，则群生和乐，方外蒙泽。

今朕晻于王道，夙夜忧劳，不通其理，靡瞻不眩，靡听不惑，是以政令多还，民心未得，邪说空进，事亡成功。

此天下所著闻也。

公卿大夫好恶不同，或缘奸作邪，侵削细民，元元安所归命哉！

乃六月晦，日有蚀之。

《诗》不云乎？‘今此下民，亦孔之哀！’

九月戊子，罢卫思后园及戾园。

冬十月乙丑，罢祖宗庙在郡国者。

诸陵分属三辅。

以渭城寿陵亭部原上为初陵。

诏曰：“安土重迁，黎民之性；骨肉相附，人情所愿也。

顷者有司缘臣子之义，奏徙郡国民以奉园陵，令百姓远弃先祖坟墓，破业失产，亲戚别离，人怀思慕之心，家有不安之意。

是以东垂被虚耗之害，关中有无聊之民，非久长之策也。

《诗》不云乎？‘民亦劳止，迄可小康，惠此中国，以绥四方。’

今所为初陵者，勿置县邑，使天下咸安土乐业，亡有动摇之心。

布告天下，令明知之。”

五年春三月，诏曰：“盖闻明王之治国也，明好恶而定去就，崇敬让而民兴行，故法设而民不犯，令施而民从。

今朕获保宗庙，兢兢业业，匪敢解怠，德薄明晻，教化浅微。

传不云乎？‘百姓有过，在予一人。’

其赦天下，赐民爵一级，女子百户牛、酒，三老、孝弟、力田帛。”

又曰：“方春，农桑兴，百姓戮力自尽之时也，故是月劳农劝民，无使后时。

今不良之吏，覆案小罪，征召证案，兴不急之事，以妨百姓，使失一时之作，亡终岁之功，公卿其明察申敕之。”

赞曰：臣外祖兄弟为元帝侍中，语臣曰：元帝多材艺，善史书。

鼓琴瑟，吹洞箫，自度曲，被歌声，分节度，穷极幼眇。

少而好儒，及即位，征用儒生，委之以政，贡、薛、韦、匡迭为宰相。

而上牵制文义，优游不断，孝宣之业衰焉。

然宽弘尽下，出于恭俭，号令温雅，有古之风烈。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">汉元帝，是汉宣帝的太子。

母亲是恭哀许皇后，宣帝微贱时生于民间。

年二岁时，宣帝继承帝位。

元帝年八岁时，被立为太子。

成年后，宽厚而尊重儒术。

见宣帝所起用的多是法吏，他们以名责实，尊君卑臣以弹治天下，大臣杨恽、盖宽饶等都因犯讥刺君上之罪而被诛戮，常在平时侍奉时从容进言：“陛下持刑太深，应用儒生。”

宣帝动怒说：“汉家自有制度，本以王霸二道交替使用，为何要专行仁政，效法周朝呢！

况且一般儒生不能用所学结合实际，喜欢厚古薄今，使人惑乱于名实，不知所从，那怎么能委以重任！”

于是叹道：“乱我刘家朝纲的，将是太子啊！”

由是就疏太子而爱淮阳王，宣帝说：“淮阳王明于察断而爱学法律，应继承我的事业。”

淮阳王的母亲张婕妤更得宠。

宣帝有意用淮阳王取代太子，但由于少年微贱时依靠许氏，夫妇义结糟糠，所以最终还是不肯背弃许皇后而另立太子。

黄龙元年十二月，宣帝驾崩。

二十六日，太子继皇帝位，到高庙祭祀。

尊皇太后为太皇太后，皇后为皇太后。

初元元年(前48)春正月初四日，葬汉宣帝于杜陵。

赏赐各侯王、公主、列侯以黄金，官吏二千石以下以钱帛，各有差别。

大赦天下。

三月，封皇太后兄侍中中郎将王舜为安平侯。

初十日，立皇后王氏。

以三辅、太常、郡国公田及皇家御苑可以借用的就借给贫民耕种，家产不满千钱的借给种子与粮食。

封外祖父平恩戴侯的同母弟之子中常侍许嘉之子为平恩侯，以作戴侯之后。

夏四月，下诏说：“朕继承先帝的神圣事业，能奉宗庙，战战兢兢。

近来数次发生地震，为上天示以警戒而惶恐，而又不知其原因。

正当农时季节，朕担心黎民中有的无力耕种，及时派遣光禄大夫褒等十二人循行于天下，慰问耆老鳏寡孤独困乏而失其常业的百姓，延请贤俊，招询隐士，以观览风俗教化。

郡守国相及二千石果能以身作则勤于政事，宣明朝廷教化，以使万姓相亲，这样就会使宇宙之内莫不和睦相亲，就基本上达到国泰民安了。

《尚书》不是说过吗？‘股肱之臣良善，众事就能安宁！’

特布告天下，使明知朕意。”

诏书又说：“关东今年谷物歉收，百姓困乏。

现令郡国受灾严重的免出租赋。

秋八月，上郡属国降胡一万余人，逃亡进入匈奴地区。

九月，关东郡国十一处大水，饥荒严重，有的地方人相食，调运附近的钱谷以救灾。

下诏说：“前者阴阳不调，黎民饥寒，失去生活保障，只因朕的德行浅薄，不足以担任治理天下的重任而居停于先帝的宫室。

现令各官馆准备迎驾的处所不必修缮，太仆减少饲马的粮食，水衡减少饲养珍禽异兽的肉类。”

二年春正月，驾临甘泉，郊祭泰畤。

赏赐云阳臣民爵位一级，赏赐女子每百户牛酒若干。

下诏免去近署的车辆与狗马，水衡所禁止开采的园囿、宣春苑、少府的猎场水池、射苑中的池田，都借与贫民谋生。

下诏说：“常闻圣帝贤王在位，阴阳协和，风调雨顺，日月光，星宿定位，百姓安宁，益寿延年。

今日朕恭承天地，位尊于公侯之上，明不能够烛照四海，德不足以安定兆民，灾异屡现，连年不息。

在二月二十八日，陇西郡发生地震，毁落太上皇庙殿壁木饰，毁坏原道县城郭官寺及人民房屋，压死多人。

山崩地裂，水泉涌出。

上天降灾，多次警朕。

治国有过，罪有应得。

日夜战战兢兢，不能理解发生灾变的原因，内心有说不出的痛苦，思绪紊乱。

近年经常歉收，百姓穷困，经受不住饥寒交迫，就铤而走险陷入囚狱，朕深为哀怜。

郡国因地震灾害严重的免出租赋。

赦天下。

凡是可以蠲除减省以方便百姓的，可以逐条上奏，不必有所回避。

丞相、御史、中二千石都荐举才华出色的敢于直言极谏之士，朕将亲自阅览他们所提出的批评与建议。”

秋季七月，下诏说：“连年灾害，民有菜色，朕深感惨痛。

已命令有关官员虚仓廪、开府库以行赈饥者食、赐寒者衣。

今秋禾麦也不同程度受灾。

一年中几次地震。

北海涨潮，流杀人民。

阴阳不和，过失何在？

公卿认为应如何进行处置？

希望尽意批评朕的过失，不必有所隐讳。”

冬，下诏说：“国家将走向兴盛，就尊重师傅。

原前将军望之为朕师傅八年，教导经书，其功甚美。

现赐爵为关内侯，食邑八百户，每月只在初一与十五入朝。”

十二月，中书令弘恭、石显等人诬告望之，元帝令望之自杀。

三年春，下令诸侯国相位在郡守之下。

珠崖郡山南县造反，广征群臣之谋。

待诏贾捐之认为可暂放弃珠崖造反事不管，应集中力量救灾。

于是未对珠崖采取行动。

夏四月三十日，茂陵白鹤馆火灾。

下诏说：“前者火灾发生在武帝园陵馆中，朕战栗恐惧。

不了解变异的发生之因，过失在于朕躬。

群臣又未肯极力批评朕的错误，以至于此，朕怎能寝安于席啊！

百姓累遭灾患，国家赈救不力，加之受苛吏的烦扰，受条文的拘牵，不得保其性命，朕甚为同情。

现决定赦天下。”

夏，发生旱灾。

立长沙炀王弟宗为王。

封已故海昏侯贺之子代宗为侯。

六月，下诏说：“曾闻安民之道，在于协调阴阳。

近来阴差阳错，风雨不时。

朕德行有亏，总希望诸公卿中有能无所顾忌地指出朕的过失，实则不然。

唯唯诺诺，不肯极力进谏，朕深感不安。

经常怀念黎民的饥寒，他们有的远离父母妻子，从事官家所差役的不急之事，守卫那些并无人居住的宫殿，这恐怕不符合协理阴阳之道啊！

现决定罢免甘泉、建章宫的守卫，令卫卒就农。

百官各省开支。

呈奏不必有所顾忌。

有关官员要恪尽职守，不要贻误农时。

丞相御史举荐天下明了阴阳灾异的各三人。”

从此提批评建议的人多起来了。有的被提拔召见，人人都自以为能深明天子之意。

前些时关东连遭灾害。

饥寒疾疫，引起非正常死亡。

《诗》不是说过吗？‘凡是有人遇到丧祸之事，就应当尽力救助。’

现令太官不要每日宰杀牲禽，御膳所供按食谱减一半。

宫廷所备的车乘马匹，只供郊祀与艹鬼狩必需而已。

三月，下诏说：“五帝三王任贤使能，以登于天下至治，而今日国家混乱，难道是人民不同了吗？

问题就出在朕的不明，不能识别贤才。

是以佞人在位，贤人就受到堵塞与排挤。

特别是周秦以来的积弊，使社会风气日下，以致有的人抛弃礼义，触犯刑法，真是可悲啊！

由此看来，百姓何罪？

现在赦天下，令犯罪者努力改过自新，各务农业生产。

无田地的都借以公田，和一般贫民一样贷给种子与粮食。

赏赐吏六百石以上爵级为五大夫，勤于政事的官吏赐爵二级，继承父后的百姓赐爵一级。女子百户赐牛酒若干，鳏寡孤独及高年赐帛若干。”

本月雨雪交加，严霜伤冻麦稼，秋无所收。

二年春二月，下诏说：“曾闻唐虞象征性的施刑而民不犯法，商周法令推行而奸宄慑服。

今日朕能继承高祖的伟业，位尊于公卿之上，日夜战战兢兢，长期悬念百姓的疾苦，从未忘怀。

然而阴阳未调，日月黯淡。

百姓困苦，流离失所，盗贼兴起。

主管机构又助长残贼，未采取治理百姓的有效措施。

这都是朕的不明，治国无方。

过失就在于此，朕深感内疚。

为百姓的父母，而如此薄德，这将何以抚临百姓！

应大赦天下，赏赐民爵一级，女子每百户牛酒若干，鳏寡孤独高年、三老、孝悌力田帛若干。”

又赏赐各侯王、公主、列侯以黄金，中二千石以下至中都官长吏按差等进行赏赐。吏六百石以上赏以五大夫爵级，勤于政事的官吏各赏爵二级。”

三月初一日，出现日偏食。

下诏说：“朕战战栗栗、昼夜反省过失，不敢废事而自宁。

对于阴阳不调，不知错误出在何处。屡次晓谕公卿，期望他们努力从政。

至今一些主持政务的人，未能抓住根本，施惠不足而禁令烦苛，不能得到民心。暴猛的风气日长，和睦的大道日衰，百姓愁苦，没办法生活下去。

是以恶气弥漫，侵犯太阳，正气沉沦，日被夺光。

乃三月初一，日偏食，天显异象，以警戒朕躬。朕深感悲哀。

现令中原郡国各举德才兼具的直言之士一人。”

夏六月，下诏说：“近年来连年收成不好，四方皆困。

各地百姓，辛勤耕作，劳动而无所收获，处于饥饿的困境，无法互相救助。

朕为百姓父母，恩德不能普及，而仅以刑罚相加，内心深感伤悲。

现赦天下。”

官吏为何不及时禁断？各应尽意提出对策。”

冬，复设盐铁官、博士弟子员。

鉴于百姓生活困苦，对赋税大多予以减免，且不必供给京都与外地的徭役。

四年春二月，下诏说：“朕继承至尊的重任，不能有效地治理百姓，使其屡遭灾祸。

加以边境不安，大军在外，而征收赋税与支援前线，使百姓疲于奔命，穷困无聊，犯法触罪。

对这种朝廷失治理之道而对百姓采用严刑峻法的举措，朕深感痛心。

现赦免天下，原贷给贫民的粮钱免予偿还。”

三月，驾临雍地，祭祀五畤。

夏闰六月二十七日，宣帝园陵东关失火。

三十日，出现日偏食。

下诏说：“曾闻明王在上，忠贤各司其职，就能让百姓安居乐业，周边地区蒙受恩泽。

今日朕暗于王道，日夜忧虑，还不能求得治道的真谛。每看到一事就定不了标准，每听到一言就拿不定主张，是以政令不能贯彻始终，得不到臣民的真正拥戴，空谈阔论，未能办成几件实事。

这是天下所共闻的。

公卿大夫的爱憎各异，有的缘奸作邪，贪赃枉法，百姓将去依靠谁啊！

六月三十日，出现日食。

《诗》不是说过吗？‘今天的百姓饱受灾祸，处境是十分地可哀！’

从今以后，公卿大夫应该严肃思考上天所示的警戒，慎于修身，明确施政的长远目标，以辅佐朕的不足之处。

直言进谏，无所隐讳。”

冬十月二十日，罢去在郡国的祖宗祠庙。

各陵园分别划归三辅所辖。

以渭城寿陵亭部原上为元帝初陵。

下诏说：“安土重迁，是黎民的本性；骨肉相附，是人情的自然。

前不久，有关机构引用臣子之义，奏请迁徙郡国人民以奉园陵祭祀，使百姓远弃先祖坟墓，破产失业，亲戚别离，迁出的怀有思念亲人之心，在原籍的亲人又有不安之意。

这样，关东就会因迁徙而虚耗费用，迁入关中的人又无业可从，这不是长久之计。

《诗》不是说过吗？‘人民劳苦已久，至此可以小享安康。施恩泽于中原啊！进而安定四方。’

今所设置的初陵，不必移民设置县邑，让天下都能安土乐业，不必担心迁徙流动。

特布告天下，使百姓明知。”

五年春三月，下诏说：“常闻明王治国，明确是非标准而供臣民遵循，提倡严谨谦虚并形成社会风气，所以法设而民不犯，令施而民乐从。

今日朕继承宗庙，兢兢业业，不敢懈怠，而德薄目暗，教化浅微。

《论语》不是说过吗？‘百姓的过失，都应由君临天下的人负责。’

现赦免天下，赏赐民爵一级。女子每百户牛酒若干，三老、孝悌力田帛若干。”

诏书又说：“正值春耕与蚕桑时期，是百姓全力以赴的时刻，所以在本月要慰勉农户，不违农时。

现有不良之吏，为查证小罪，征召证人到署作证。兴生一些不急之事，以妨害百姓，使其贻误农时失去节令，而致秋后无所收获，对此，公卿要认真了解并三令五申，保证不妨害农事。”

班固评论：臣外祖兄弟曾为元帝侍中，告诉过臣说元帝兴趣广泛，精于书法。

会弹琴、吹箫，能按曲谱，为配新词，节拍分明，穷极要妙。

少年即尊崇儒术，及继帝位，征用儒生，委以政事，贡禹、薛广德、韦贤、匡衡等儒生相继为宰相。

而元帝为文义所牵制，优柔寡断，宣帝中兴之业遂衰。

          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-yüan was the Heir-apparent of Emperor Hsüan.

His mother was entitled Empress Kung-ai [née] Hsü. At the time when Emperor Hsüan was [still] an unimportant person, [the future Emperor Yüan] was born as a commoner.

When he was in his second year, Emperor Hsüan ascended the throne [and began his own reign].

and when [the future Emperor Yüan] was in his eighth year, he was made Heir-apparent.

When he had grown up, he was condescending and kind and liked Confucian scholars.

He saw that there were many written statutes among those employed by Emperor Hsüan; that his [father's] officials ruled their subjects in accordance with [the principle of] circumstances and names; and that [his father's] great courtiers, Yang Yün, Kai K'uan-jao and others, had been sentenced for critical and derogatory sayings, which were made crimes, so that they were executed. [Hence] once when he was waiting upon [Emperor Hsüan] at a banquet, he said, with a deferential bearing, "Your Majesty is too severe in applying the laws. It would be proper to employ Confucian masters [in your government]."

Emperor Hsüan changed color and said, "The Han dynasty has its own institutes and laws, which are variously [taken from] the ways of the Lords Protector and the [ideal] Kings. How could I trust purely to moral instruction and use [the kind of] government [exercised by] the Chou [dynasty]?

The vulgar Confucians moreover do not understand what is appropriate to the time; they love to approve the ancient and disapprove the present, making people to be confused about names and realities, so that they do not know what they should cherish. How could they be capable of being entrusted with responsibility?"

Thereupon he sighed and said, "The one who will confound my dynasty will be my Heir-apparent."

From this [time on], he became distant to his Heir-apparent and loved [another son], the King of Huai-yang, [Liu Ch'in]. He said, "The King of Huai-yang is intelligent concerning, has examined minutely, and loves the laws. He is worthy to be my son."

Since, moreover, the King's mother, the Favorite Beauty [née] Chang, was favored the most.

the Emperor had the intention of making the King of Huai-yang [his heir] in place of the Heir-apparent. But when [the Emperor] had been young, he had depended upon the Hsü clan, [that of the Heir-apparent's maternal grandfather], together with whom [the Emperor] had arisen from an unimportant station, hence in the end he was not [willing] to turn his back on it [by changing his Heir-apparent].

In [the year-period] Huang-lung, the first year, in the twelfth month, Emperor Hsüan died.

on [the day] kuei-szu, the Heir-apparent ascended the imperial throne and was announced in the Temple of [Emperor] Kao.

He honored the Empress Dowager [née Shang-kuan] with the title, Grand Empress Dowager, and the [Ch'iung-ch'eng] Empress [née Wang] with the title, Empress Dowager.

In [the year-period] Ch'u-yüan, the first year, in the spring, the first month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, Emperor Hsiao-hsüan was buried in the Tu Tomb.

and there were granted: to the vassal kings, the princesses, and the full marquises, actual gold; and to officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs and under, cash and silk; to each proportionately.

A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

In the third month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed the older brother of the [Ch'iung-ch'eng] Empress Dowager [née Wang], the Palace Attendant and General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Wang Shun, as Marquis of An-p'ing.

and on [the day] ping-wu he established the Empress née Wang [as Empress].

The public [plowed] fields, together with the parks which could be dispensed with in [the districts of] the Three Adjuncts and the Grand Master of Ceremonies and in the commanderies and kingdoms, were used to assist the poor people in their occupations; to those whose property did not amount to fully one thousand cash there were given loans of seed and food.

[The Emperor] enfeoffed as the Marquis of P'ing-en the Regular Palace Attendant Hsü Chia, the son of the full brother to [the Emperor's deceased] maternal grandfather, Marquis Tai of P'ing-en, [Hsü Kuang-han], to uphold the [ancestral sacrifices that should be performed by] the posterity of Marquis Tai.

In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial edict said, "We have received [the opportunity to continue] the sage succession of [Our] deceased [ancestors], the emperors, and have obtained [the opportunity] to uphold [the sacrifices in the imperial] ancestral temples, [in doing which We have been] fearful and circumspect.

[But] recently the Earth has shaken several times and has not been quiet. [We] are dismayed by the warnings of Heaven and Earth, not knowing for what reason [they have come].

It was just at the time for cultivating the fields, and We are solicitous lest the multitude of ordinary people should lose [the results of] their work. [Hence We] in person send the Imperial Household Grandee Pao and others, twelve persons [in all], to travel about and inspect the empire, to visit and inquire about the common people who are aged, widowers, widows, orphans, childless, in suffering, indigent, or unemployed, to invite and present [to the throne] capable and distinguished [persons], to summon and make appear [worthy persons in] poor or mean [conditions], and to use the opportunity to observe the development of [the people's] customs.

If the Chancellors [of kingdoms], the Administrators [of commanderies, and the officials ranking at] two thousand piculs can in truth make themselves upright and toil to make known clearly [Our] instruction and transforming influence, in order that [We] may come close to all the people, then within the six directions [all will live in] peace and friendship, almost without any worries.

Does not the Book of History say, `When the legs and arms [of the Emperor, i.e., the officials] are good, All business will be happily performed'?

[Let] this be published and made known to the empire, to cause Our intentions to be made clearly known."

It also said, "East of the [Han-ku] Pass, the grain has not ripened this year and many of the common people are suffering or indigent.

Let it be ordered that those kingdoms and commanderies which have been injured severely by this calamity shall not pay the land or capitation taxes.

and that [the revenues of] the rivers, the Ocean, the reservoirs, the lakes, the gardens, and the ponds which are under the supervision of the Privy Treasurer shall be used to lend to poor people and [they shall] not pay the land or capitation taxes.

[We] grant: to those enregistered as belonging to the imperial house, [from] one horse to two quadrigae of [horses to each]; to the Thrice Venerable and the Filially Pious, five bolts of silk; to the Fraternally Respectful and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, three bolts; to widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, two bolts; and to the officials and common people of fifty households, an ox and wine."

In the sixth month, because the common people were [suffering from] sickness and pestilence, [the Emperor] ordered the Grand Provisioner to diminish the [imperial] food, [ordered the regular number of] persons in the Bureau of Music reduced, and dispensed with the horses of the pastures, in order to assist the suffering and indigent.

In the autumn, the eighth month, more than ten thousand surrendered northwestern barbarians (Hu), [who had been under the supervision of the Chief Commandant] of Dependent States in Shang Commandery, escaped and entered Hun [territory].

In the ninth month, in eleven commanderies and kingdoms east of [Han-ku] Pass, there was high water and famine so that there were cases of people eating one another. Cash and grain from neighboring commanderies were transported to succor them.

An imperial edict said, "Recently the Yin and Yang have not been in accord, so that the many people have [suffered] famine and cold, and there has been no means of safeguarding peace and good order. Verily, [Our] virtue is shallow and thin, insufficient to fill or enter into the old [imperial] dwellings.

Let it be ordered that the palaces and lodges which the emperor rarely favors [with a visit] shall not be repaired or prepared, that the Grand Coachman shall reduce the grain for feeding his horses, and that [the Chief Commandant of] Waters and Parks shall dispense entirely with the flesh for feeding the animals [in the Shang-lin Park menagerie and elsewhere]."

In the second year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Kan-ch'uan [Palace with a visit, where he performed] the suburban sacrifice at the altar to the Supreme [One].

He granted to the common people of Yün-yang [Commandery] one step in noble rank and to the women of a hundred households an ox and wine.

[In the second month], he established his younger brother, [Liu] Ching, as King of Ch'ing-ho.

In the third month, he established [Liu] Pa, the Heir-apparent of King Li of Kuang-ling, [Liu Hsü], as King [of Kuang-ling].

An imperial edict [ordered] the disestablishment of the chariots, carriages, dogs, and horses [under control of] the Yellow Gate, of the [imperial] private gardens under [the supervision of the Chief Commandant] of Waters and Parks, of the Lower Park at Yi-ch'un, of the outer ponds of the Sharpshooters [who were under the supervision of] the Privy Treasurer, and of the hiding-places in the preserves, the ponds, and the fields [in the imperial parks]. They were lent to the poor people.

An imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when a capable and sage [ruler] is on the throne, the Yin and Yang are harmonious, the wind and rain are timely, the sun and moon are brilliant [without eclipses], the stars and zodiacal signs are in repose, and the many people are prosperous and peaceable and end in old age [the days allotted to them by] their fate.

Now that We have respectfully succeeded to [the care of] Heaven and Earth and have been confided with [a place] above that of the highest nobles, [Our] understanding has not been able to light up [the universe and Our] virtue has not been able to tranquillize [it, so that] visitations and prodigies have arrived simultaneously and have not ceased for successive years.

Moreover, in the second month, on [the day] mou-wu, there was an earthquake in Lung-hsi Commandery, which destroyed and made the wooden decorations on the wall of the [great] hall in the Temple of the Grand Emperor fall, ruined and demolished the inner and outer city walls and the official buildings of Huan-tao Prefecture, together with the houses and buildings of the common people, and crushed to death a multitude of people.

Mountains have fallen down and the earth has been rent, streams and springs have gushed forth.

Heaven has in truth sent down visitations to terrify and frighten Us and [Our] multitude.

[Our] rule must be greatly deficient for the calamities [sent by Heaven] to have reached such [a magnitude].

Morning and night, [We] have been circumspect and fearful, [but] have not comprehended these great [unfortunate] vicissitudes. [We] have pondered deeply, [but] have been baffled and chagrined [that We] have not understood the [proper] order [of things].

Recently for several years, there has been no good harvest, so that the great multitude are suffering and indigent, are unable to endure [the extremes of] famine and cold, and hence have become involved in punishments and chastisements. We pity them very much.

[Let] those commanderies and kingdoms which have suffered severe visitations of earthquakes not pay the land or capitation taxes.

[Let] an amnesty [be granted] to the empire.

If there is anything [in the laws and ordinances] that can be suppressed, abolished, reduced, or dispensed with for the benefit of all people, [let] it be memorialized in detail, and let nothing be kept hidden.

[Let] the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Yü Ting-kuo], the [Grandee] Secretary, [Ch'en Wan-nien], and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs recommend [persons who are] Accomplished Talents of Unusual Degree, gentlemen who [are able] to speak frankly and admonish unflinchingly, and We shall Ourself interview them."

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] ting-szu, [the Emperor] appointed his Imperial Heir-apparent, [Liu Ao].

and granted: to the Grandee Secretary, [Ch'en Wan-nien], the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis; to [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, [the noble rank of] Senior Chief of the Multitude; to those in the empire who would be the successors of their fathers, one step in noble rank; to each full marquis, two hundred thousand cash; and to Fifth [Rank] Grandees, one hundred thousand [cash].

In the sixth month, there was famine east of [Han-ku] Pass and in the region of Ch'i people ate each other.

In the autumn, the seventh month, an imperial edict said, "For successive years there have been visitations and disasters, so that the common people are anaemic. [We] are suffering and saddened in heart.

and have already [issued] an imperial edict [ordering] the officials to empty the storehouses and granaries, to open the warehouses and depots, to aid and rescue [the people], and to make grants of clothes to those who are cold.

This autumn the grain and wheat have been considerably injured.

within one year the Earth has twice shaken.

in Po-hai [Commandery] streams have overflowed and carried away and killed people.

The Yin and Yang are not harmonious. Wherein lies the blame for these [circumstances]?

In what way should the ministers be solicitous for this [situation]?

Let them do their utmost to make known Our faults and not be silent about anything."

In the winter, an imperial edict said, "If a state is to prosper, [its ruler must] reverence his teachers and esteem his tutors.

The former General of the Van, [Hsiao] Wang-chih, tutored [Us] to the eighth year, guiding [Us] by the Classics. His achievements are abundant.

Let him be granted the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis with the income of an estate of eight hundred households; he shall pay court on the first and fifteenth of the month."

[But] in the twelfth month, the Chief Palace Writer, Hung Kung, [together with] Shih Hsien and others, slandered [Hsiao] Wang-chih [to the Emperor] and caused [Hsiao Wang-chih] to commit suicide.

In the third year, in the spring, [the Emperor] ordered that Chancellors of vassal [kings] should be ranked below [Grand] Administrators of commanderies.

[Because] the prefectures south of the mountains in Chu-yai Commandery had rebelled, [the Emperor asked] the various officials generally for plans [to deal with this rebellion].

the Expectant Appointee, Chia Chüan-chih, considered that it would be proper to abandon Chu-yai [Commandery], in order to aid the common people [of northeastern China] in their famine of grain and vegetables.

Thereupon Chu-yai [Commandery] was abolished.

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] yi-wei, there was a visitation [of fire] in White Crane Lodge at the Mou Tomb.

The imperial edict said, "Recently a visitation of fire descended upon a Lodge in the [funerary park of Emperor] Hsiao-wu. We tremble with respectful awe, being afraid and fearful.

not comprehending [this] grievous vicissitude and prodigy. The blame [must lie] upon Us Ourself.

The many high officials have, moreover, not yet been willing to tell Us [Our] faults to the end, so that [things] have been brought to this [pass]. How can they be awakened [to the situation]?

The people have continued to meet with baneful distresses, so that there is no means of helping them. They have furthermore been molested and troubled by exacting officials and by being held down and tied to the details of written [laws], so that they are not allowed to prolong their lives to a [natural] end. We pity them very much.

Let an amnesty [be granted] to the empire."

In the summer, there was a drought.

[The Emperor] established [Liu] Tsung, the younger brother of King Yang of Ch'ang-sha, [Liu Tan], as King [of Ch'ang-sha].

and enfeoffed [Liu] Tai-tsung, a son of the deceased Marquis of Hai-hun, [Liu] Ho, as Marquis [of Hai-hun].

In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that the way to tranquillize the people has its source in [tranquillizing] the Yin and Yang.

[But] recently the Yin and Yang have been disordered and are in disaccord, so that the wind and rain have not been timely.

We are not virtuous and hoped that among the highest ministers some would have the daring to speak to Us of [Our] faults. But now it has been otherwise.

They have frivolously agreed [with Our ideas], have negligently followed [Our wishes], and have not been able to speak unflinchingly. We pity them greatly.

[We] have long pondered that when the multitude of people are in famine and cold [some] have been sent far away from their fathers and mothers, their wives and children, to toil at unnecessary work or to act as guards in uninhabited palaces. [We] fear that this is not a way of aiding the Yin and Yang [to attain their harmony].

"Let the guards at Kan-ch'uan and Chien-chang Palaces be disestablished and [let each person] be ordered to go to [his home and devote himself to] agriculture.

[Let] all the officials each reduce their expenses.

[Let matters] be memorialized in detail without keeping silent about anything.

[Let] the high officials exert themselves and not violate the prohibitions for the four seasons.

[Let] the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Yü Ting-Kuo], and the [Grandee] Secretary, [Ch'en Wan-nien], each present the three [best] persons in the empire who understand the visitations and prodigies [caused by] the Yin and Yang."

Thereupon a multitude [of so-called experts] discussed these matters; some were advanced and promoted and summoned to an [imperial] audience, and [each] considered that he had divined the Emperor's opinion.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Kan-ch'uan [Palace with a visit, where he performed] the suburban sacrifice at the altar to the Supreme [One].

In the third month, he [again] traveled and favored Ho-tung [Commandery with a visit, where he] sacrificed to Sovereign Earth.

He granted an amnesty to the convicts in Fen-yin.

and granted: to the common people, one step in noble rank; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; and to widowers, widows, and aged, silk.

The places through which he passed were not to pay the land tax or capitation taxes.

In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] made the Baronet Baron Descendant of the Chou [Dynasty, Chi Yen-nien], the Marquis Who Succeeds to the Greatness of the Chou [Dynasty], with a rank next to that of the vassal kings.

In the third month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Yung [with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].

In the summer, the fourth month, a comet appeared in [the constellation] Shen.

and an imperial edict said, "Since We are inadequate [to Our position], the ranking [of persons] in their positions is not carefully scrutinized, and many offices have long been unoccupied and have not been filled with the [proper] persons.

so that the great multitude has lost its hope [of good rulers. This situation] has affected August Heaven above, so that the Yin and Yang have produced grievous vicissitudes, hence [Our] fault has spread to the many common people. We are greatly dismayed at [this situation].

"Recently, for successive [years], east of [Han-ku] Pass there have occurred visitations and disasters of famine, cold, sickness, and epidemics.

so that premature death has not [permitted the people] to live out their lives.

Does not the Book of Odes say, `Wherever among others there was a great misfortune, I crawled on my knees to help them'?

"Let it be ordered that the Grand Provisioner shall not butcher daily and that each of his provisions be reduced by half.

[Let] the imperial equipages and the horses that are fed be merely sufficient so that they do not fail in their proper business.

Let there be abolished: the competitive games, the Palaces and Lodges in Shang-lin Park that are rarely favored with an imperial [visit], the Three Offices for Garments in Ch'i [Commandery], the offices for [public] fields in Po-chia, the offices of the Salt and Iron [Government Monopoly], and the Constantly Equalizing Granaries.

Let no [restricted] number be established for the Disciples of the Erudits, in order to increase [the number of] students [in the Imperial University.

"Let] there be granted: to the members of the imperial house who are enregistered, [from] one horse to two quadrigae of [horses to each]; to the Thrice Venerable and the Filially Pious, five bolts of silk per person; to the Fraternally Respectful and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, three bolts; to widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, two bolts; and to the officials and common people of fifty households, an ox and wine."

"Let the punishments be reduced" in more than seventy matters.

"Let there be expunged, for Imperial Household Grandees and under, down to Gentlemen-of-the-Palace, the ordinance [requiring punishment for those] who had made themselves responsible for their fathers, mothers, or own brothers or sisters.

"Let it be ordered that the Retinue and those who serve within the Majors' [Gates] to the palaces shall be permitted [to secure] for their grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers, mothers, and older and younger brothers, registration [permitting them] to enter [the palaces]."

In the winter, the twelfth month, on [the day] ting-wei, the Grandee Secretary, Kung Yü, died.

A Major of the [Palace] Guard, Ku Chi, [was sent] as an envoy to the Huns, [but] did not return.

In [the period] Yung-kuang, the first year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Kan-ch'uan [Palace with a visit, where he performed] the suburban sacrifice at the altar to the Supreme [One].

and [granted] pardon to the convicts in Yün-yang [Commandery].

He granted: to the common people, one step in the noble rank; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; and to the aged, silk.

[Those places] through which he had passed in traveling were not to pay the land-tax or capitation taxes.

In the second month, an imperial edict [ordered] the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Yü Ting-kuo], and the [Grandee] Secretary, [Hsieh Kuang-tê], to recommend persons who were simple and straightforward, sincere and honest, humble and yielding to others, and who showed good behavior. The [Superintendent of] the Imperial Household should yearly examine and rank the Gentlemen and [Imperial] Retinue according to these [four qualities].

In the third month, an imperial edict said, "The Five Lords and the Three Kings gave office to the capable and employed the able in order to attain to extreme tranquility. Yet how could the misgovernment of today [come from the fact that] these common people are different [from those of ancient times]?

The blame lies in Our lack of intelligence and lack of means in becoming acquainted with capable [persons].

For this reason flatterers are in office and `admirable gentlemen' are prevented [from securing office] and hide themselves.

[These evils] are aggravated by the corruption [coming from] the Chou and Ch'in [periods], so that the common people are being permeated with despicable customs. They depart from the rules of proper conduct and right principles, and [as a result] bring upon themselves the punishments of the law. Is not this indeed sad?

Looking at it in this way, what guilt has the great multitude?

"Let an amnesty be granted to the empire and [let] it be ordered that [the people to whom amnesty has been granted] shall improve their personalities, renew themselves, and each pay attention to cultivating his acres.

[Let] those [amnestied people] who have no cultivated fields all be loaned [fields] and be made loans of seed and food the same as for [ordinary] poor people.

[Let] there be made grants: to officials [ranking at] six hundred piculs and above, the noble rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee; to officials who are diligent in doing their duty, two steps [in noble rank]; to the common people, one step; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; to widowers, widows, orphans, childless, and aged, silk."

In this month it snowed and there was a fall of frost which injured the wheat harvest. In the autumn, it was abolished.

In the second year, in the spring, the second month, an imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when T'ang [Yao] and Yü [Shun employed] punishments [which merely portrayed] the likenesses [of the mutilating punishments in criminals' clothing], the common people did not transgress, and when the Yin and Chou [dynastic] laws were put into practise, evil-doers and traitors submitted.

Now We have had the opportunity of succeeding to the great patrimony of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and have been entrusted with a position above that of the highest nobles. Morning and night [We] have trembled with respectful awe, pondering long on the necessities of the people, which [We] do not allow to leave [Our] mind.

But the Yin and Yang have not yet accorded [with each other], the three luminaries have been veiled and indistinct.

The great multitude have suffered greatly, have wandered, and have been scattered on the highways and paths. Robbers and brigands have arisen simultaneously.

The high officials are, moreover, habitually injurious and hard [upon the people] and have been defective in the art of shepherding the common people.

The foregoing is all [because of] Our lack of insight and [because Our] government shows a deficiency.

[Since Our] faults have produced such [a situation], We are very much ashamed of Ourself.

If [We], the father and mother of the common people, have been so incapable, what [can We] say to [Our] subjects?

"Let a general amnesty [be granted] to the empire, and [let there be] granted: to the common people, one step in noble rank; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; to widowers, widows, orphans, childless, aged, the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, silk.

[Let there] also be granted: to the vassal kings, the princesses, and the full marquises, actual gold; to the [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs and those of lower [rank] down to the chief officials in the offices at the imperial capital, [money], to each proportionately; to the officials [ranking at] six hundred piculs and above, the noble rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee; to each official who is diligent in doing his duty, two steps [in noble rank]."

In the third month, on [the day] jen-hsü, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "We have been trembling and in respectful awe, day and night thinking of [Our] faults and defects, and have not dared to be negligent or at peace.

[We] have pondered that the Yin and Yang have not been harmonized and [We] have not yet [secured] enlightenment [concerning what is] to blame. [We] have frequently ordered the ministers [to find where the fault lies] and have daily hoped that [Our efforts] would bring results.

"Down to the present, the [high] officials who control the government have not yet attained to the mean [in their government]. In their grants and gifts [of favor] and in their prohibitions and sentences, they have not yet accorded with the opinions of the common people. Violent and cruel customs increase more and more, and ways of peace and friendliness are daily enfeebled, so that the people are sad and suffering, with no place to rest themselves.

"For this reason evil emanations have yearly increased and have encroached upon and violated the great Yang [being, the sun], so that good emanations have been submerged and arrested, and the sun for a long time has been robbed of his light.

乃壬戌，日有蚀之，天见大异，以戒朕躬，朕甚悼焉。

Let it be ordered that the inner commanderies and kingdoms should each recommend one gentleman who is an Accomplished Talent of Unusual Degree [or] who is capable, good, and [able to] speak frankly."

In the summer, the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Recently for consecutive years, [the harvest] has not been gathered and the four quarters [of the empire] are all suffering.

The great multitude of common people work hard at plowing and weeding, but it does not produce any results, so that they suffer from a famine of grain and vegetables, and there is no means by which they can be saved.

We are the father and mother of the people, [but Our] virtue is not able to protect them. Yet [We must at times] punish them, which hurts Ourself greatly.

Let an amnesty [be granted] to the empire."

In the autumn, the seventh month, the Western Ch'iang rebelled, and [the Emperor] sent the General of the Right, Feng Feng-shih, to attack them.

In the eighth month, the Grand Master of Ceremonies, Jen Ch'ien-ch'iu, was made the General Displaying his Majesty, with a separate command over five colonels. He advanced together with [Feng Feng-shih].

In the third year, in the spring, the Western Ch'iang were pacified and the armies were demobilized.

In the third month, [the Emperor] set up his Imperial Son [Liu] K'ang as King of Chi-yang.

In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] kuei-wei, the Commander-in-chief and General of Chariots and Cavalry, [Wang] Chieh, died.

In the winter, the eleventh month, an imperial edict said, "乃者已丑地动，中冬雨水、大雾，盗贼并起。

吏何不以时禁？各悉意对。”

In the winter, there were reestablished the offices of the Salt and Iron [Government Monopoly] and a [restricted] number for the Disciples of the Erudits.

because the [government] income was insufficient and too many of the common people had been exempted, so that there were not [enough persons] to furnish the required labor and required military service in the central [states] and at the borders.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the second month, an imperial edict said, "We have succeeded to the cares of the most honorable [station, yet We] have not been able to enlighten or direct the people aright. Baneful calamities have frequently occurred.

added to which the border regions have not been at peace and the armies [have had to be sent] out of [the border, so that, because of] taxes and transportation [of supplies], the great multitude have been troubled and agitated, are exhausted and suffering without any assistance, and have violated the laws and fallen into crime.

夫上失其道而绳下以深刑，朕甚痛之。

Let an amnesty [be granted] to the empire, [let] their debts not be collected from the poor people to whom loans were made."

In the third month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Yung [with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].

In the summer, the sixth month, on [the day] chia-hsü, there was a visitation [of fire] to the Eastern Portal of the Funerary Park of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsüan.

and on [the day] mou-yin, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when an intelligent king is in control and faithful and capable [subordinates] display [a proper attention to] their duties, the many living things are in harmony and rejoice, and [even those] outside the [empire at the four] quarters receive benefits.

"[But] now We are ignorant about the Way of [true] kings. Day and night [We] have solicitously toiled, [yet We] have not penetrated to its principles. There is nothing that [We] have looked at which has not been confused and nothing that [We] have heard that has not been misleading. For this reason many of the governmental ordinances have been returned, the affections of the common people have not been secured, erroneous explanations have been vainly presented, and nothing has been achieved.

此天下所著闻也。

The ministers and grandees are not alike in their likes and dislikes; some associate with the wicked and act corruptly, encroaching upon and extorting from the uninfluential common people—how can the great multitude find refuge for their lives?

Thereupon, on the last day of the sixth month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

Does not the Book of Odes say, `Now these lower [classes of] the common people Are in a very deplorable [situation]'?

"From this time and henceforth, let the ministers and grandees exert themselves and think upon Heaven's warning. [Let] them be careful of themselves and cultivate far-reaching [thoughts], in order to support [Us because of] Our inadequacies.

speaking frankly their entire meaning and not keeping silent about anything."

In the ninth month, on [the day] wu-tzu, [the Emperor] abolished the funerary park of the Empress Szu [née] Wei, together with the funerary park of [Heir-apparent] Li, [Liu Chü].

In the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] yi-ch'ou, [the Emperor] disestablished the temples in the commanderies and kingdoms to the [Eminent] Founder, [Emperor Kao], and the [Great and Epochal] Successors, [Emperors Hsiao-wen and Hsiao-wu].

The various [imperial] tomb-[towns] were divided and put under the charge of the Three Adjuncts.

On the [northern] plain in the Shou-ling Commune section of Wei-ch'eng [prefecture] there was being made the Emperor's tomb.

and an imperial edict said, "It is the nature of the many common people to be contented with their locality and to consider transportation [to a different locality] as a serious matter. To have one's flesh and blood attached to [and near] oneself is what human affections desire.

A short time ago, some high officials memorialized that, according to the principles [involved in the relationship of] a subject [to his ruler], common people from the commanderies and kingdoms should be transported [to Our tomb] to uphold [the sacrifices at Our] funerary park and tomb, [thus] causing the people to leave and abandon the tombs and mounds of their deceased ancestors, ruining their patrimonies and losing their property, [making] relatives to be divided and separated from each other, people [to be tormented by] thoughts of longing and affection, and families to have feelings of dissatisfaction.

In this way the eastern extremities of the empire would suffer the injury of being depopulated and ruined and Kuan-chung would possess common people who have no resources, which is not an expedient [for one who plans] far ahead.

Does not the Book of Odes say, `The common people have indeed been heavily burdened; Now they can be [given] a little ease. Favor this center of the country In order to give repose to the four quarters [of the country]'?

"Let those who are now making the emperor's tomb not be [compelled to remain there and let them not be] established as [inhabitants of] the prefecture or estate [supporting this tomb, thus] causing all the empire to be satisfied with their localities, rejoice in their patrimonies, and have no feeling of being troubled or disturbed.

[Let this edict] be published and announced to the empire, to cause it to be clearly understood."

[The Emperor] also abolished the estate supporting [the tomb of] the father and mother, [Hsü Kuang-han and his wife], of the deceased Empress [Kung-ai née Hsü].

In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Kan-ch'uan [Palace with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altar to the Supreme [One].

In the third month, the Emperor favored Ho-tung [Commandery with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altar to Sovereign Earth.

In the autumn, in Ying-ch'uan [Commandery], the streams overflowed, carrying away and killing people.

The officials and [imperial] retinue whose [native] prefectures had suffered injury were given a vacation, and the officers and soldiers [among the drafted men who came from those prefectures] were sent home.

In the winter, the Emperor favored [with a visit] the Lodge for Shooting Bears in Ch'ang-yang [Palace] and arrayed his chariots and horsemen for a great hunt.

In the twelfth month, on [the day] yi-yu, the funerary chambers, the temples, and the funerary parks of the Grand Emperor and of Emperor Hsiao-hui were done away with.

In [the period] Chien-chao, the first year, in the spring, the third month, the Emperor favored Yung [with a visit, where he] sacrificed at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].

In the autumn, the eighth month, from Tung-tu Gate to Chih-tao there were white butterflies flying in swarms that hid the sun.

In the winter, the King of Ho-chien, [Liu] Yüan, who had committed crimes, was dismissed and exiled to Fang-ling.

The funerary chambers and funerary parks of the Empress Dowager [née Po of Emperor] Hsiao-wen and of the Empress Dowager [née Chao of Emperor] Hsiao-chao were abolished.

In the second year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Kan-ch'uan [Palace with a visit, where he performed] the suburban sacrifice at the altar to the Supreme [One].

In the third month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored Ho-tung [Commandery with a visit, where he] sacrificed to Sovereign Earth.

[The Emperor] increased the rank of the Grand Administrators of the three Ho Commanderies [and of large] commanderies [to that of fully two thousand piculs.

Commanderies with] 120,000 households were made `large commanderies'.

In the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty [was granted] to the empire.

In the sixth month, [the Emperor] set up his Imperial Son [Liu] Yü as the King of Hsin-tua. In the intercalary month, on [the day] ting-yu, the Grand Empress Dowager née Shang-kuan died.

In the winter, the eleventh month, there was an earthquake and a great fall of snow in [the kingdoms of] Ch'i and Ch'u. Trees were broken and houses fell in ruin.

Chang Po, the maternal uncle of the King of Huai-yang, [Liu Ch'in], and the Grand Administrator of the Wei Commandery, Ching Fang, were sentenced for having led astray a vassal king by perverse notions, and having divulged [imperial] conversations [that occurred] in the inner palace apartments, [respectively. Chang] Po was executed by being cut in two at the waist and [Ching] Fang was publicly executed.

In the third year, in the summer, [the Emperor] ordered that the Chief Commandants to the Three Adjuncts and the Chief Commandants in large commanderies should be all ranked at two thousand piculs.

In the sixth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en, the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Wei] Hsüan-ch'eng, died.

In the autumn, the Chief Commandant of Cavalry who had been sent out as Protector-general of the Western Frontier Regions, Kan Yen-shou, and his Associate, Colonel Ch'en T'ang, by fraud mobilized the officials and troops of the agricultural garrison under the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, together with the northwestern barbarian (Hu) troops of the Western Frontier Regions, and attacked Shan-yü Chih-chih.

In the winter, they cut off his head and sent it to the [imperial] capital, where it was hung on the gate of the Lodge for Barbarian Princes.

In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, because Shan-yü Chih-chih had been executed, information was made [to the Lords on High] in the Suburban Sacrifice and in the sacrifices [to the imperial ancestors in their] Temples.

and an amnesty was granted to the empire.

The courtiers [wished] the Emperor long life.

A feast was held [by the Emperor] and the documents and charts concerning [Shan-yü Chih-chih] were shown [even] to the honored ladies in the [imperial] harem.

In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial edict said, "We have succeeded to the glorious achievements of our imperial predecessors. Morning and night [We] have been respectfully attentive, fearing lest [We may] not be capable in [Our] duties.

Recently the Yin and Yang have not accorded [with each other], and the five elements have lost their order, so that the people have been famished.

[We] have been pondering that the multitude [of people] have lost their occupations and [We] have visited and sent the Grandee-remonstrant and Erudit Ch'ang and others, twenty-one persons [in all], to travel about and examine the empire, to visit and inquire about the aged, widowers, widows, orphans, childless, and the people who are indigent, suffering, or have lost their work, and to recommend gentlemen who are Accomplished Talents and have especial eminence.

[Let] the chancellors, generals, and nine high ministers apply themselves with all their minds and be not negligent, so that We shall be able to observe the propagation of [Our] instruction and civilizing efforts."

In the sixth month, on [the day] chia-shen, the King of Chung-shan, [Liu] Ching, died.

In Lan-t'ien [prefecture], there was an earthquake and a mountain collapsed, and gravel and stones blocked the Pa River. At the An Tomb, the [river] bank collapsed and blocked the Ching River, so that its water flowed backwards.

In the fifth year, in the spring, the third month, an imperial edict said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when an intelligent king rules the country, he makes plain what to like and dislike and fixes what should be rejected and accepted; he exalts respectfulness and yielding [to others], and then the common people cultivate their conduct. Hence when his laws are instituted, the common people do not violate them, and when his ordinances are promulgated, the common people follow them.

"Now that We have secured [the opportunity to] protect the [Imperial] ancestral temples, [We] have been careful and fearful, and have not dared to be lax or negligent. [But Our] virtue has been slight and [Our] intelligence has been obscured, so that [Our] teaching and civilizing influence has been shallow and slight.

Does not the Memoir say, `When the people commit faults, [the blame] rests upon Us'?

Let an amnesty [be granted] to the empire and let there be granted: to the common people, one step in noble rank; to the women of a hundred households, an ox and wine; and to the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Brotherly Respectful, and the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, silk."

[The edict] also said, "Just now it is spring, the time when farmers and cultivators of silkworms begin their work, when the people unite their forces and use their energies to the utmost. Hence in this month [We] encourage the farmers and exhort the common people not to permit themselves [to leave their work undone until] after [the proper] time.

"[But] now evil officials, in reconsidering law-cases involving small crimes, in calling and summoning witnesses in [such] cases, take up matters that are not pressing and so trouble the people. By making [the people] lose the one time [when their] work [can be done, the officials cause them] to bring to naught a whole year's labor. Let the ministers examine and investigate [such cases] and inform and warn the [officials about this matter]."

In the summer, the sixth month, on [the day] keng-shen, the Funerary Park of [Heir-apparent] Li, [Liu Chü], was reestablished.

On [the day] jen-shen, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] keng-tzu, the Funerary Chamber, the Temple, and the Funerary Park of the Grand Emperor, the Second Temple [of Emperor Kao], and the Funerary Parks of Empress Chao-ling, King Wu-ai, Queen Chao-ai, and Empress Szu [née] Wei were reestablished.

In the period Ching-ning, the first year, in the spring, the first month, the Hun Shan-yü Hu-han-hsieh came to pay court.

The imperial edict said, "The Hun Shan-yü Chih-chih abandoned and rebelled against the rules of proper conduct and principles of fealty and so has already suffered for his crimes, [whereas] Shan-yü Hu-han-hsieh has not forgotten [Our] favors and benefits. He has turned toward and striven to follow the rules of proper conduct and principles of fealty, [and now] has again renewed the rites of [presenting his] congratulations at the [great annual] court. He wishes to guarantee the [border] barriers and to continue [this practise] endlessly, so that the borders and frontiers will eternally be without any warlike affairs.

Let the year-period be changed to be Ching-ning and [let] the [Lady] Awaiting an Imperial Edict in the Lateral Courts, Wang Ch'iang, be granted to the Shan-yü to be his Yen-chih."

The Imperial Heir-apparent, [Liu Ao], was capped.

heirs of full marquises were granted the noble rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee and those in the empire who would be the successors to their fathers [were granted] one step in noble rank.

In the second month, the Grandee Secretary, [P'an] Yen-shou, died.

[In the third month, on [the day] kuei-wei, there were reestablished the Funerary Chamber, the Temple, and the Funerary Park of Emperor Hsiao-hui, and the Funerary Chambers and Funerary Parks of the Empress Dowager [née Po of Emperor] Hsiao-wen and of the Empress Dowager [née Chao of Emperor] Hsiao-chao.

In the summer, [the Emperor] enfeoffed the Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Kan Yen-shou, as a full marquis.

and granted to his Associate [Protector-General of the Western Frontier Regions], Colonel Ch'en T'ang, the noble rank of Kuan-nei Marquis and a hundred catties of actual gold.

In the fifth month, on [the day] jen-ch'en, the Emperor died at the Wei-yang Palace.

The Temples of the Grand Emperor and of Emperors Hsiao-hui and Hsiao-ching were done away with.

and the Funerary Chambers and Funerary Parks of the Empresses Dowager [née Po and née Chao of Emperors] Hsiao-wen and Hsiao-chao [respectively], of Empress Chao-ling, of King Wu-ai, and of Queen Chao-ai were abolished.

In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] ping-hsü, [the Emperor] was buried in the Wei Tomb.

In eulogy we say: The elder and younger brothers of your servant, [Pan Piao's], maternal grandfather, were Emperor Yüan's Palace Attendants, and spoke to your servant, saying, "Emperor Hsüan had much ability in polite arts and was good at the clerkly [style of] writing.

at playing the guitar and lute, and at blowing the open flute. He himself composed new songs, clothed them with melodies for singing, distinguished and indicated the cadences [of the verses and music], and understood to the utmost the delicacies [of poetry and music]."

When he was young, he liked the Confucians, and when he ascended the throne, he summoned and gave office to Confucian masters, entrusting the government to them. Kung [Yü], Hsieh [Kuang-tê], Wei [Hsüan-ch'eng], and K'uang [Heng] were successively his ruling chancellors.

The Emperor, however, tied and controlled himself by written principles, so that he hesitated to settle matters, and thus the achievements of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsüan decayed.

Yet he was broad-minded and had his inferiors express themselves completely. He was outstanding in respectfulness and self-restraint. His proclamations and ordinances are polished and elegant, and have the spirit and fire of the ancients.</div>
