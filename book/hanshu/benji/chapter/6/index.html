          <div class="txt">孝文皇帝，高祖中子也，母曰薄姬。

高祖十一年，诛陈豨，定代地，立为代王，都中都。

十七年秋，高后崩，诸吕谋为乱，欲危刘氏。

丞相陈平、太尉周勃、朱虚侯刘章等共诛之，谋立代王。

语在《高后纪》、《高五王传》。

大臣遂使人迎代王。

郎中令张武等议，皆曰：“汉大臣皆故高帝时将，习兵事，多谋诈，其属意非止此也，特畏高帝、吕太后威耳。

今已诛诸吕，新喋血京师，以迎大王为名，实不可信。

愿称疾无往，以观其变。”

中尉宋昌进曰：“群臣之议皆非也。

夫秦失其政，豪杰并起，人人自以为得之者以万数，然卒践天子位者，刘氏也，天下绝望，一矣。

高帝王子弟，地犬牙相制，所谓盘石之宗也，天下服其强，二矣。

汉兴，除秦烦苛，约法令，施德惠，人人自安，难动摇，三矣。

夫以吕太后之严，立诸吕为三王，擅权专制，然而太尉以一节入北军，一呼士皆袒左，为刘氏，畔诸吕，卒以灭之。

此乃天授，非人力也。

今大臣虽欲为变，百姓弗为使，其党宁能专一邪？

内有朱虚、东牟之亲，外畏吴、楚、淮南、琅邪、齐、代之强。

方今高帝子独淮南王与大王，大王又长，贤圣仁孝闻于天下，故大臣因天下之心而欲迎立大王，大王勿疑也。”

代王报太后，计犹豫未定。

卜之，兆得大横。

占曰：“大横庚庚，余为天王，夏启以光。”

代王曰：“寡人固已为王，又何王乎？”

卜人曰：“所谓天王者，乃天子也。”

于是代王乃遣太后弟薄昭见太尉勃，勃等具言所以迎立王者。

昭还报曰：“信矣，无可疑者。”

代王笑谓宋昌曰：“果如公言。”

乃令宋昌骖乘，张武等六人乘六乘传，诣长安，至高陵止，而使宋昌先之长安观变。

昌至渭桥，丞相已下皆迎。

昌还报，代王乃进至渭桥。

群臣拜谒称臣，代王下拜。

太尉勃进曰：“愿请间。”

宋昌曰：“所言公，公言之；所言私，王者无私。”

太尉勃乃跪上天子玺。

代王谢曰：“至邸而议之。”

闰月己酉，入代邸。

群臣从至，上议曰：“丞相臣平、太尉臣勃、大将军臣武、御史大夫臣苍、宗正臣郢、朱虚侯臣章、东牟侯臣兴居、典客臣揭再拜言大王足下：子弘等皆非孝惠皇帝子，不当奉宗庙。

臣谨请阴安侯、顷王后、琅邪王、列侯、吏二千石议，大王高皇帝子，宜为嗣，愿大王即天子位。”

代王曰：“奉高帝宗庙，重事也。

寡人不佞，不足以称。

愿请楚王计宜者，寡人弗敢当。”

群臣皆伏，固请。

代王西乡让者三，南乡让者再。

丞相平等皆曰：“臣伏计之，大王奉高祖宗庙最宜称，虽天下诸侯万民皆以为宜。

臣等为宗庙、社稷计，不敢忽。

愿大王幸听臣等。

臣谨奉天子玺、符再拜上。”

代王曰：“宗室、将、相、王、列侯以为莫宜寡人，寡人不敢辞。”

遂即天子位。

群臣以次侍。

使太仆婴、东牟侯兴居先清宫，奉天子法驾迎代邸。

皇帝即日夕入未央宫。

夜拜宋昌为卫将军，领南、北军，张武为郎中令，行殿中。

还坐前殿，下诏曰：“制诏丞相、太尉、御史大夫：间者诸吕用事擅权，谋为大逆，欲危刘氏宗庙，赖将、相、列侯、宗室、大臣诛之，皆伏其辜。

朕初即位，其赦天下，赐民爵一级，女子百户牛、酒，酺五日。”

元年冬十月辛亥，皇帝见于高庙。

遣车骑将军薄昭迎皇太后于代。

诏曰：“前吕产自置为相国，吕禄为上将军，擅遣将军灌婴将兵击齐，欲代刘氏。

婴留荥阳，与诸侯合谋以诛吕氏。

吕产欲为不善，丞相平与太尉勃等谋夺产等军。

朱虚侯章首先捕斩产。

太尉勃身率襄平侯通持节承诏入北军。

典客揭夺吕禄印。

其益封太尉勃邑万户，赐金五千斤。

丞相平、将军婴邑各三千户，金二千斤。

朱虚侯章、襄平侯通邑各二千户，金千斤。

封典客揭为信阳侯，赐金千斤。”

十二月，立赵幽王子遂为赵王，徙琅邪王泽为燕王。

吕氏所夺齐、楚地皆归之。

尽除收帑相坐律令。

正月，有司请蚤建太子，所以尊宗庙也。

诏曰：“朕既不德，上帝神明未歆飨也，天下人民未有惬志。

今纵不能博求天下贤圣有德之人而嬗天下焉，而曰豫建太子，是重吾不德也。

谓天下何？其安之。”

有司曰：“豫建太子，所以重宗庙、社稷，不忘天下也。”

上曰：“楚王，季父也，春秋高，阅天下之义理多矣，明于国家之体。

吴王于朕，兄也；淮南王，弟也：皆秉德以陪朕，岂为不豫哉！

诸侯王、宗室昆弟有功臣，多贤及有德义者，若举有德以陪朕之不能终，是社稷之灵，天下之福也。

今不选举焉，而曰必子，人其以朕为忘贤有德者而专于子，非所以忧天下也。

朕甚不取。”

有司固请曰：“古者殷、周有国，治安皆且千岁，有天下者莫长焉，用此道也。

立嗣必子，所从来远矣。

高帝始平天下，建诸侯，为帝者太祖。

诸侯王、列侯始受国者亦皆为其国祖。

子孙继嗣，世世不绝，天下之大义也。

故高帝设之以抚海内。

今释宜建而更选于诸侯宗室，非高帝之志也。

更议不宜。

子启最长，敦厚慈仁，请建以为太子。”

上乃许之。

因赐天下民当为父后者爵一级。

封将军薄昭为轵侯。

三月，有司请立皇后。

皇太后曰：“立太子母窦氏为皇后。”

诏曰：“方春和时，草木群生之物皆有以自乐，而吾百姓鳏、寡、孤、独、穷困之人或阽于死亡，而莫之省忧。

为悯父母将何如？其议所以振贷之。”

又曰：“老者非帛不暖，非肉不饱。

今岁首，不时使人存问长老，又无布帛酒肉之赐，将何以佐天下子孙孝养其亲？

今闻吏禀当受鬻者，或以陈粟，岂称养老之意哉！具为令。”

有司请令县道，年八十已上，赐米人月一石，肉二十斤，酒五斗。

其九十已上，又赐帛人二匹，絮三斤。

赐物及当禀鬻米者，长吏阅视，丞若尉致。

不满九十，啬夫、令史致。

二千石遣都吏循行，不称者督之。

刑者及有罪耐以上，不用此令。

楚元王交薨。

四月，齐、楚地震，二十九山同日崩，大水溃出。

六月，令郡国无来献。

施惠天下，诸侯、四夷，远近欢洽。

乃修代来功。

诏曰：“方大臣诛诸吕迎朕，朕狐疑，皆止朕，唯中尉宋昌劝朕，朕已得保宗庙。

以尊昌为卫将军，其封昌为壮武侯。

诸从朕六人，官皆至九卿。”

又曰：“列侯从高帝入蜀、汉者六十八人益邑各三百户，吏二千石以上从高帝颖川守尊等十人食邑六百户，淮阳守申屠嘉等十人五百户，卫尉足等十人四百户。”

封淮南王舅赵兼为周阳侯，齐王舅驷钧为靖郭侯，故常山丞相蔡兼为樊侯。

二年冬十月，丞相陈平薨。

诏曰：“朕闻古者诸侯建国千余，各守其地，以时入贡，民不劳苦，上下欢欣，靡有违德。

今列侯多居长安，邑远，吏卒给输费苦，而列侯亦无由教训其民。

其令列侯之国，为吏及诏所止者，遣太子。”

十一月癸卯晦，日有食之。

诏曰：“朕闻之，天生民，为之置君以养治之。

人主不德，布政不均，则天示之灾以戒不治。

乃十一月晦，日有食之，適见于天，灾孰大焉！

朕获保宗庙，以微眇之身托于士民君王之上，天下治乱，在予一人，唯二三执政犹吾股肱也。

朕下不能治育群生，上以累三光之明，其不德大矣。

令至，其悉思朕之过失，及知见之所不及，匄以启告朕。

及举贤良方正能直言极谏者，以匡朕之不逮。

因各敕以职任，务省徭费以便民。

朕既不能远德，故憪然念外人之有非，是以设备未息。

今纵不能罢边屯戍，又饬兵厚卫，其罢卫将军军。

太仆见马遗财足，余皆以给传置。”

春正月丁亥，诏曰：“夫农，天下之本也，其开籍田，朕亲率耕，以给宗庙粢盛。

民谪作县官及贷种食未入、入未备者，皆赦之。”

三月，有司请立皇子为诸侯王。

诏曰：“前赵幽王幽死，朕甚怜之，已立其太子遂为赵王。

遂弟辟强及齐悼惠王子朱虚侯章、东牟侯兴居有功，可王。”

乃立辟强为河间王，章为城阳王，兴居为济北王。

因立皇子武为代王，参为太原王，揖为梁王。

五月，诏曰：“古之治天下，朝有进善之旌，诽谤之木，所以通治道而来谏者也，今法有诽谤、訞言之罪，是使众臣不敢尽情，而上无由闻过失也。

将何以来远方之贤良？其除之。

民或祝诅上，以相约而后相谩，吏以为大逆，其有他言，吏又以为诽谤。

此细民之愚无知抵死，朕甚不取。

自今以来，有犯此者勿听治。”

九月，初与郡守为铜虎符、竹使符。

诏曰：“农，天下之大本也，民所恃以生也，而民或不务本而事末，故生不遂。

朕忧其然，故今兹亲率群臣农以劝之。

其赐天下民今年田租之半。”

三年冬十月丁酉晦，日有食之。

遂免丞相勃，遣就国。

秋七月，上自太原至长安。

三月，除关，无用传。

诏曰：“道民之路，在于务本。

朕亲率天下农，十年于今，而野不加辟。

岁一不登，民有饥色，是从事焉尚寡，而吏未加务也。

吾诏书数下，岁劝民种树，而功未兴，是吏奉吾诏不勤，而劝民不明也。

且吾农民甚苦，而吏莫之省，将何以劝焉？

其赐农民今年租税之半。”

又曰：“孝悌，天下之大顺也；力田，为生之本也；三老，众民之师也；廉吏，民之表也。

朕甚嘉此二三大夫之行。

今万家之县，云无应令，岂实人情？

是吏举贤之道未备也。

其遣谒者劳赐三老、孝者帛，人五匹；悌者、力田二匹；廉吏二百石以上率百石者三匹。

及问民所不便安，而以户口率置三老、孝、悌、力田常员，令各率其意以道民焉。”

春，诏曰：“朕获执牺牲、珪币以事上帝宗庙，十四年于今。

历日弥长，以不敏不明而久抚临天下，朕甚自愧。

其广增诸祀坛场、珪币。

昔先王远施恩泽不求其报，望祀不祈其福，

右贤左戚，先民后己，至明之极也。

今吾闻祠官祝釐，皆归福于朕躬，不为百姓，朕甚愧之。

夫以朕之不德，而专乡独美其福，百姓不与焉，是重吾不德也。

春三月，孝惠皇后张氏薨。

诏曰：“间者数年比不登，又有水旱疾疫之灾，朕甚忧之。

愚而不明，未达其咎。

意者朕之政有所失而行有过与？

乃天道有不顺，地利或不得，人事多失和，鬼神废不享与？

何以致此？

将百官之奉养或费，无用之事或多与？

何其民食之寡乏也！

夫度田非益寡，而计民未加益，以口量地，其于古犹有余，而食之甚不足，者其咎安在？

无乃百姓之从事于末以害农者蕃，为酒醪以靡谷者多，六畜之食焉者众与？

细大之义，吾未能得其中。

其与丞相、列侯、吏二千石、博士议之，有可以佐百姓者，率意远思，无有所隐也。”

二年夏，行幸雍棫阳宫。

匈奴和亲。

诏曰：“朕既不明，不能远德，使方外之国或不宁息。

夫四荒之外不安其生，封圻之内勤劳不处，二者之咎，皆自于朕之德薄而不能达远也。

间者累年，匈奴并暴边境，多杀吏民，边臣兵吏又不能谕其内志，以重吾不德。

夫久结难连兵，中外之国将何以自宁？

今朕夙兴夜寐，勤劳天下，忧苦万民，为之恻怛不安，未尝一日忘于心，故遣使者冠盖相望，结彻于道，以谕朕志于单于。

今单于反古之道，计社稷之安，便万民之利，新与朕俱弃细过，偕之大道，结兄弟之义，以全天下元元之民。

和亲以定，始于今年。”

七年夏，六月己亥，帝崩于未央宫。

遗诏曰：“朕闻之：盖天下万物之萌生，靡不有死。

死者天地之理，物之自然，奚可甚哀！

当今之世，咸嘉生而恶死，厚葬以破业，重服以伤生，吾甚不取。

且朕既不德，无以佐百姓。

今崩，又使重服久临，以罹寒暑之数，哀人父子；

伤长老之志，损其饮食，绝鬼神之祭祀，以重吾不德，谓天下何！

朕获保宗庙，以眇眇之身托于天下君王之上，二十有余年矣。

赖天之灵。

社稷之福，方内安宁，靡有兵革。

朕既不敏，常畏过行，以羞先帝之遗德；

惟年之久长，惧于不终。

今乃幸以天年得复供养于高庙，朕之不明与嘉之，其奚哀念之有！

其令天下吏民，令到出临三日，皆释服。

无禁取妇、嫁女、祠祀、饮酒、食肉。

自当给丧事服临者，皆无践。

绖带无过三寸。

无布车及兵器。

赐诸侯王以下至孝悌、力田金、钱、帛各有数。

赞曰：孝文皇帝即位二十三年，宫室、苑囿、车骑、服御无所增益。

有不便，辄弛以利民。

尝欲作露台，召匠计之，直百金。

上曰：“百金，中人十家之产也。

吾奉先帝宫室，常恐羞之，何以台为！”

身衣弋绨，所幸慎夫人衣不曳地，帷帐无文绣，以示敦朴，为天下先。

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">孝文皇帝，是汉高祖的第四子，母亲是薄姬。

高祖十一年（公元前196年），诛杀陈豨，平定代地，就立他为代王，定都于中都。

代王十七年（公元前180年）秋，吕后去世，诸吕图谋政变，想夺取刘汉政权。

丞相陈平、太尉周勃、朱虚侯刘章等共诛吕氏，共商迎立代王刘恒为皇帝。

史事记入《汉书·高后纪、高五王传》中。

大臣们派人迎接代王。

代王的郎中令张武等商议后，说：“汉朝大臣都是高帝时的一些老将，熟习军事，深谙权谋机诈，其内心并不满足于现在的地位，只是害怕高帝与吕后的威严罢了。

现在诸吕已诛，又血溅京都，此时以迎大王入京称帝为名，实在令人难以置信。

希望大王以有病为由不要前往，以观察情况的变化。”

中尉宋昌进言道：“他们这些议论是错误的。

秦朝朝纲紊乱，豪杰并起，想取代秦朝而得南面称帝的不下万人，但最后能君临天下的，仅刘氏一家，天下怀有非分之想的人已感绝望，这是其一。

高皇帝封子弟为王，封地犬牙交错，这就成了磐石般的核心，天下服于刘汉的强大，这是其二。

汉朝建立，废除了秦朝的苛敛，减省刑罚，广施德惠，人人自安，深得人心，此其三。

而以吕太后那样的威严，立诸吕为三王，擅权专制，然而太尉周勃持一符节进入北军，一声呼唤士卒都左袒，支持刘氏，反对诸吕，结果把吕氏消灭了。

由此可见刘汉政权出于天授，不是靠少数人力可改变的。

如今虽然有的大臣想要发动政变，但百姓不愿听其驱使，靠他的少数党羽就能够达到目的吗？

京都内有朱虚侯、东牟侯的团结，外有吴、楚、淮南、琅王牙、齐、代的强大。

如今高帝之子只有淮南王与大王您，大王居长，圣贤仁孝，名播天下，所以朝中大臣顺万民之望而想迎立大王，大王就不必有所顾虑了。”

代王禀报太后，一时也难以决策。

便让人占卜，兆得大横。

卜人占辞道：“大横亘亘，我为天王，夏启光宗耀祖。”

代王说：“寡人本来就是王，又何必加一个王号呢？”

卜人说：“卦中所谓的天王，就是天子啊！”

于是代王派遣太后的弟弟薄昭见太尉周勃，周勃等详细报告了迎立代王的真意。

薄昭回报代王说：“是可信的，没什么可怀疑的。”

代王笑对宋昌说：“果然如先生所言。”

就派宋昌主管车驾，派张武等六人快马去长安报信。车驾到高帝陵停止前进，而派宋昌先到长安观察动静。

宋昌到达渭桥，丞相以下的官员都来迎接。

宋昌到高陵回报代王，于是代王也进达渭桥。

群臣以臣子之礼拜见代王，代王亦谦逊回拜。

太尉周勃进言说：“请求秘密禀陈。”

宋昌说：“要是太尉所陈的是公事，就请当着众臣的面上奏；要是所陈的是私事，王者是无私的。”

太尉周勃就跪着送上天子玉玺。

代王辞谢说：“请到京都王宫再议。”

闰九月二十九日，进入代王官邸。

群臣都跟着来了，呈上奏议说：“丞相臣陈平、太尉臣周勃、大将军臣柴武、御史大夫臣张苍、宗正臣刘郢、朱虚侯臣刘章、东牟侯臣刘兴居、典客臣刘揭再拜进言于大王足下：子弘等都不是孝惠帝之子，不应继承帝位。

臣谨请阴安、顷王后、琅王牙王、列侯、吏二千石等相议，大王是高皇帝之子，应当继承，愿大王即天子位。”

代王说：“奉祀高帝宗庙，这是重大的事。

寡人不才，不足以担当此任。

愿请高帝之弟楚王考虑合适人选，寡人实不敢当。”

群臣都拜伏于地，坚决请求代王同意。

代王向西辞让三次，向南辞让两次。

丞相陈平等都说：“臣衷心认为，大王继承高皇帝大统最为相称，天下诸侯万民都认为是天经地义。

臣等为宗庙社稷考虑，不敢怠慢。

希望大王能俯顺臣等的请求。

臣谨奉天子玉玺符节再拜呈上。”

代王说：“既然宗室、将相、王侯认为寡人是合适的皇位继承人，寡人就不敢推辞了。”

于是即天子位。

群臣各依原职。

派太仆灌婴、东牟侯兴居先清扫未央宫，奉天子仪仗到代王馆舍迎接。

皇帝当日晚进入未央官。

当夜封宋昌为卫将军，统领南北军，张武为郎中令，巡查殿中。

帝坐于前殿，下诏令说：“诏谕丞相、太尉、御史大夫：昔日诸吕专擅权柄，阴谋篡逆，想危害刘氏宗庙，赖将相、列侯、宗室、大臣将其诛灭，都各伏其罪。

朕初登基，应该大赦天下，赏赐天下男子爵一级，女子每百户赐牛若干头，酒若干石。聚饮五日为欢。”

文帝元年冬十月二日，皇帝在高祖庙接见群臣。

派车骑将军薄昭去代地迎皇太后到京。

下诏说：“前时吕产自封为相国，吕禄为上将军，擅遣将军灌婴领兵击齐，企图取代刘汉。

灌将军停兵荥阳，与诸侯合谋以诛吕氏。

吕产欲做篡逆之事，陈平丞相与周勃太尉等运谋夺取吕产所控制的北军。

朱虚侯刘章首先捕斩吕产。

太尉周勃亲率襄平侯通持节承诏入北军。

典客刘揭智夺吕禄相印。

因此加封太尉周勃邑万户，赐金五千斤。

加封丞相陈平、将军灌婴邑各三千户，赐金二千斤。

加封朱虚侯刘章、襄平侯刘通邑各二千户，金千斤。

封典客刘揭为阳信侯，赐金千斤。”

十二月，立赵幽王之子刘遂为赵王，迁调琅王牙王刘泽为燕王。

吕氏所夺齐、楚地都归还原主。

废除秦法“一人有罪，株连全家”的律令。

正月，有关官吏请文帝早立太子，是为了尊崇宗庙。

文帝下诏说：“朕德行浅薄，上天神明并不情愿享受我对他们的祭祀，天下人民也认为我还不是他们理想中的皇帝。

今日不能广求天下圣贤有德之人来接替帝位，却建议要早立太子，这就使我的薄德更亏了。

这怎么能满足天下的人对我的期待？立太子事暂缓计议。”

有关官吏又上奏：“早定太子，正是以宗庙社稷为重，证明皇上时时把天下大事牢记于心的。”

皇上说：“楚王，是朕的叔父，年高德劭，具有丰富的阅历与经验，对治理国事了如指掌。

吴王、淮南王与朕是兄弟。他们都是秉德以辅朕，这岂不是早已安排好了皇位继承人么！

各侯王宗室兄弟中有不少功臣，有不少贤德仁义之人。要是从上述贤人中推举有崇高德行的以接替朕不能胜任的帝位，这就是社稷之灵，天下之福了。

今日不去推选贤人，而说一定要立太子，人们就会认为朕忘记了贤德之人而一心要让自己的儿子继位，这不是真正的在关心天下大事。

朕实不愿采纳。”

有关官员再三请求说：“古代殷、周得天下，长治久安近千年。以往有天下的都不及殷周相传久远，就是因为殷、周都采用传位于太子之道。

立太子一定要是皇帝的儿子，历史上从来如此。

高皇帝开始平定天下，建立诸侯，成为刘汉皇帝的太祖。

各侯王列侯开始受封国的也都成为封国的国祖。

子孙继承，世世不绝，这是天下的公理。

所以高祖立太子以安定四海。

今日放弃应该立子为太子的事不办，而另从诸侯宗室中去进行推选，这不是高皇帝的原意。

另行推选是不合适的。

皇子启是长子，敦厚慈仁，请皇上立他为太子。”

皇上终于同意了。

因此赐天下人民应为父亲的继承人的爵一级。

封将军薄昭为轵侯。

三月，有关官吏请求立皇后。

皇太后说：“立太子之母窦氏为皇后。”

文帝下诏说：“当春风和畅时，飞潜动植等物都有复苏之乐，而我们百姓中的鳏寡孤独穷困的人或挣扎于死亡的边缘，而得不到关怀与温暖。

作为民之父母其心何安？应讨论如何进行赈济。”

诏文又说：“老人不穿棉袄不暖，不吃肉食不饱。

当今年春初，要经常派人看望父老，如不赐一些布帛酒肉，又怎么能帮助天下的子孙孝养其亲？

曾听到有的官吏在发放养老粮时，竟给以陈粟烂米，这能说是在贯彻养老的诏令吗？！现在具体制定条例。”

有关官吏通知各县、道，年在八十以上，赐每人每月米一石，肉二十斤，酒五斗。

年在九十以上，又增加每人帛二疋，絮三斤。

对年过九十的老人赐物及发放养老粮时，县令要亲自督促检查，县丞或县尉要亲自送交。

不满九十的，由农政官员、令史送交。

高层官员要派有德行的官吏巡回检查，对不执行诏令的要予以查处。

已被判刑及犯有将判二年以上刑罚的老人，不用此令。”

楚元王刘交去世。

四月，齐、楚地震，二十九山同日崩，大水溃涌。

六月，诏令郡国不向朝廷献呈财物。

惠政广及天下，诸侯及四夷远近都感戴皇恩。

于是铨叙从代到京的辅佐人员的功劳。

诏书说：“当大臣们诛讨诸吕以后迎立朕为帝时，朕心存疑虑，多劝朕不要离开代地。惟中尉宋昌劝朕要不负众望，朕才决定继承大统。

已经加封宋昌为大将军，现又加封宋昌为壮武侯。

其余随朕至京的张武等六人，提升至九卿。”

诏令又说：“列从高皇帝进入蜀汉的六十八人各增封邑三百户。二千石以上的高级官吏曾经随从高皇帝的颍川守尊等十人封食邑六百户，淮阳守申屠嘉等十人封食邑五百户。卫尉足等十人封食邑四百户。”

封淮南王舅赵兼为周阳侯，齐王舅驷钧为靖郭侯，原常山丞相蔡谦为樊侯。

汉文帝二年（公元前178年）冬十月，丞相陈平去世。

下诏说：“朕听说古时候诸侯建国众多，各守其地，按时向朝廷进贡，百姓赋役不重，上下和睦快乐，没有违民所愿。

当今列侯多居于长安，离封邑甚远，吏卒供给输送甚为劳苦，而列侯亦无机会去教训其封邑的人民。

现令列侯都到自己的封邑去。其中在朝为官或诏令恩准留京的，可派其太子到封邑去。”

十一月三十日，日偏食。

下诏说：“朕听说过，天生人民，天为人民置立君主以进行治理。

君主无德，施政失衡，上天就示以灾异以儆戒其治道不宜。

而十一月三十日，日偏食，这是上天见责的征兆，显示朕的过失是很多的！

朕能继承大统，以卑微之身托于士民侯王之上，天下治乱，在我一人。各位大臣等于是我的股肱。

朕下不能治育百姓，上致日月星辰的失序，朕的德行是十分缺乏的。

各大臣接诏后，都认真检讨朕的过失，以及朕尚没有了解与考虑到的问题，祈求不吝告朕。

还请推举贤良方正直言敢谏的人，以匡正朕的失误。

因此下诏令各位大臣履行职责与任务，当务之急是减省役赋以方便人民。

朕既不能以德行绥服远方，还寝不安席地担心外患的发生，因而不敢放松边防的设备。

今日即使不能罢免边防屯戍，也不应派重兵守卫京都。现大量减少京都守卫士卒的人数。

太仆也要减少马匹数量，在基本保证朝廷所需后，多余的都拨给传送驿站。”

春正月十五日，下诏说：“农业，是天下之本，应建立帝王亲自耕田地的制度，朕亲自领人耕种，以供应宗庙祭祀所需的膳食。

对于百姓中犯有拖欠偿还、缴纳县署的种子与粮食之罪，或交纳不齐之罪，都予以赦免。”

三月，有关官吏请立皇子为诸侯王。

诏令说：“以前赵幽王遭软禁而死，朕甚为同情，已立其太子遂为赵王。

遂弟辟疆及齐悼惠王子朱虚侯章、东牟侯兴居有功，可立为王。”

于是立辟疆为河间王、刘章为城阳王、兴居为济北王。

同时立皇子武为代王、参为太原王、揖为梁王。

五月，下诏令说：“古代治理天下，朝廷门前设有进善言的旌旗，立有批评的柱板，是为了使上下通达而广开言路。而当今的法律有‘诽谤妖言’之罪，这就使得众臣不敢做到知无不言与言无不尽，而皇上也就无法听到过失了。

这怎么能让远方的贤良来批评朝政？应该废除。

百姓有时咒诅君上，开始互相邀约而后来又互相欺诳，这种只有犯罪动机而无犯罪行动，官吏以为是大逆不道，若有其他言论，官吏又加以诽谤之罪名。

这是小民的愚昧表现，由于不懂法律而触犯死罪，朕认为甚不恰当。

从今以后，对这种犯罪未遂的不必受理。”

九月，开始发给郡守铜虎符、竹使符。

文帝下诏说：“农业，是天下的根本，人民所赖以生存的，如果人民不认真从事根本而去流动经商，那么衣食就会缺乏。

朕对此十分担忧，所以今天朕亲领群臣进行农耕以进行劝勉。

今年免除百姓应纳的田租一半作为奖励。”

三年冬十月三十日，日偏食。

十一月三十日，日又偏食。

诏说：“前时曾诏遣列侯各回封国去，推辞而未能成行。

丞相是朕最为倚重的，望带头作表率回到自己的封国去。”

于是免去周勃丞相之职，遣他回到封国。

十二月，封太尉颍阴侯灌婴为丞相，免去太尉职位，隶属于丞相。

夏四月，城阳王刘章去世。

淮南王刘长杀辟阳侯审食其。

五月，匈奴入居北地、河南进行掳掠。

皇上驾临甘泉，派丞相灌婴反击匈奴，匈奴北去。

调出维持宫廷治安的材官归属于卫将军，守卫长安京都。

皇上从甘泉到高奴，接着驾临太原，接见往日代地群臣，都有赏赐。

论功行赏，按民里赏赐牛、酒。

免除晋阳、中都百姓的三年租税。

驻跸并游览太原十余日。

济北王兴居得知皇上到代地去了还准备御驾亲征匈奴，就乘朝中无主发动叛乱，调遣兵马打算袭击荥阳。

于是下诏令罢免丞相灌婴兵权，委棘蒲侯柴武为大将军，率领四名勇将十万兵马剿击叛军。

祁侯缯贺为将军，增援荥阳。

秋七月，皇上从太原到长安。

下诏说：“济北王背叛朝廷，坑害吏民，为罪魁祸首。

济北吏民在朝廷官军未到就拟作归顺朝廷以及以军队城邑降顺于官军的，一律赦罪，并仍居职。

与济北王兴居有联系的，也予赦免。”

八月，俘虏了济北王兴居，兴居自杀。

皇上下诏说：“导民的途径，在于抓住农业这个根本。

朕亲自耕作以劝勉农耕，已经十年了，而田野尚得不到充分开垦。

每逢年景不好，百姓就处于饥饿状态，这是因为从事农业的人尚不足，而各地官吏未能认真重视农业的缘故。

我多次下诏，每年劝百姓多植树，而功效甚微，这也是地方官吏执行我的诏令不认真，对百姓的宣传动员更没有明确的措施所致。

加之我们的农民负担苦重，而地方官吏又漠不关心，这怎能提高农民的生产积极性？

为此今年免除农民应交赋税的一半。”

诏书又说：“尊老爱幼，是最高尚的社会风气。努力耕作，是最重要的生活根本。三老，是人民的老师，廉吏，是人民的表率。

朕特别钦佩孝悌力田、三老与廉吏的操行。

今日万家之县，却说无人可应察举之令，岂能符合事实？

这反映了地方官吏举贤的措施不够得力。

现派专使慰问三老，人赏帛五匹，爱幼的、力田的每人赏帛二匹，廉吏二百石以上每一百石加赏三匹。

为了经常了解百姓不安心或不便农业的情况，现按户口若干设置三老、孝悌力田管理人员，让他们深刻领会诏书的意义而教化百姓。”

十三年春二月十六日，下诏说：“朕亲自领人进行农耕以推动粮食生产的发展，皇后亲自进行蚕桑以供宗庙祭祀之需，并建立耕桑的礼制。”

夏，废除秘祝之官，其事在《郊祀志》。

五月，除肉刑法，其事在《刑法志》。

六月，下诏说：“农业，是天下之本，应给予特别重视。

今日农人勤身耕作，而与商贾同出租赋，这就是本末无有差别，是不符合于奖励农耕的原则的。

现免除农田租税。

赐天下孤寡布帛、丝絮各若干。”

十四年冬，匈奴骚扰边境，杀北地都尉孙卬。

皇上派三位将军镇守陇西、北地、上郡，中尉周舍为卫将军，郎中令武为车骑将军，统军于渭北，车辆千乘、骑兵十万人。

皇上亲自劳军，进行检阅，申明教令，赏赐士卒。

皇上打算亲征匈奴，群臣谏阻，不听。

皇太后痛切要求皇上不要亲冒矢石，皇上才罢其意。

于是派东阳侯张相如为大将军，建成侯董赫、内史栾布都任将军，出击匈奴，匈奴退走。

春，下诏说：“朕能奉献牺牲圭币以祭祀上帝宗庙，至今已十四年了。

在位的时间很久，以无所作为之人长期君临天下，朕深感惭愧。

只有扩大祭祀规模与增加祭品精度以谢神祗。

昔日先王远施恩泽而不求他人报答，虔诚祭祀而不祈个人福祉。

厚贤薄亲，先民后己，实为英明之极。

现我闻祠官祝福，都希望福祉集于朕身，而不为百姓祈祷，这使朕更为愧疚。

以朕这不德之人，一心追求个人的美满幸福，而不与百姓同享，这就更为增加了我的过失。

现令祠官向神祗致敬，切不可为我个人祈福。”

十五年春，黄龙现于成纪。

皇上就下诏讨论郊祭事宜。

公孙臣明确各类服色，新垣平设立五帝庙宇。均记在《郊祀志》中。

恢复名山大川断绝了的祭祀，主管官员按规定的季节进行祭祀。

诏令天下欢饮。明年改元。

文帝后元元年(公元前163)冬十月，新垣平因为诈欺君被发觉，谋反，三族被诛。

春三月，孝惠皇后张氏去世。

下诏书：“过去几年频繁歉收，屡遭水旱疾疫之灾，朕深为忧虑。

我愚而不明，尚不知其故何在。

是朕的政事有所失且行为有缺点呢？

还是天道有不顺，地利难以得，人事多失和，鬼神不愿享受祭祀呢？

到底是何种原因？

是百官的俸禄过高与劳民伤财的事办得过多吗？

为什么粮食竟如此的缺乏呀！

度量耕地并未减少，统计人口增加的也不多，按人口平均占有耕地，比之于古代还要多，而粮食却极为不足，失误的根源何在？

是否由于百姓弃农经商，如大量酿酒而浪费粮食，过多的饲养牲畜而消费粮食以致严重地损害了农业呢？

从小与大各方面来探计，我还未能找出症结所在。

现愿与丞相、列侯、吏二千石及博士来集思广益，凡是能对百姓有所帮助的，无论是偶有所感与考虑成熟的，都可以言无不尽。”

二年夏，皇上巡幸雍棫阳宫。

六月，代王参病故。

与匈奴建立友好亲善关系。

皇上下诏说：“朕非圣明之君，不能德服远人，致周边邻国屡行侵扰。

近来边境线上军民不安其生，京畿之内，征夫奔走不息，这两方面的损失，都是由于朕的薄德而不能使远方悦服所致。

过去几年，匈奴不断暴掠边境，杀害不少边疆吏民，而边防官吏，又不能向其晓谕我朝愿意与他们友好相处的意图，更加重了我无德服远的过失。

似此长期兵连祸结，中外之国将怎样保持自身的安宁？

近日朕早起晚睡，为国事操劳，为万民忧苦。精神上的痛苦与不安，未曾忘怀过一天。所以派遣外交使节频繁来往，车辙如结，以将朕的友好意愿转告于单于王。

今匈奴王恢复以往和睦相处的传统，从双方社稷的安定，两国人民的方便来考虑，愿意和朕都不咎既往，同建睦邻关系，结为兄弟之国，以满足中外人民的愿望。

两国的友好睦邻关系已经确立，从今年开始。”

夏四月，大旱，蝗灾。

诏令诸侯不得向朝廷纳贡，解除对山泽开采的禁令，减省多项公务开支，精简冗员，打开各地粮仓赈济灾民，有爵级的人可以卖爵。

七年夏六月初一日，文帝驾崩于未央宫。

留下遗诏说：“朕听说：大凡天下万物从萌生以后，都要走向死亡。

死亡是天地间的常理，事物的自然规律，何必为此而恸哀！

现今之世，都爱生而恶死，厚葬以致浪费财业，重服以致伤害民生，我极不赞同。

何况朕德行浅薄，未能给百姓带来福祉。

在去世之后，又进行长时间的隆重的吊唁活动，使临丧者遭受在寒暑中受尽丧礼的折磨，让别人的子弟为我尽哀。

就会令别人的长老感到伤神；损坏其他鬼神的祭馔来丰盛对我的祭馔，就会使其他的鬼神因之饥饿，这就更加增重了我的罪过，这叫我如何向天下交代！

朕继承大统，以细末之身托于天下君王之上，已经二十三年了。

依赖于上天的威灵。

社稷的洪福，四海安宁，未有战乱。

朕秉性愚钝，常恐言行有过失，以玷辱先帝的煌煌帝德。

而在位时间愈久，更恐不能善始善终。

今日幸以自然的死亡得以供养于刘汉的祖庙之中，这实在是对我这个薄德之人最大的嘉勉，这还有什么应该哀恸的！

可令天下吏民，在接到志哀令后三天即停止悼念活动。

不得禁止在国丧期间举行嫁娶、祭祀的饮酒食肉。

凡必须参加葬礼的，都不要大量披麻戴孝。

其头与腰的孝带宽不过三寸。

不要用布帛来铺盖灵车及派羽林军护灵。

不要派百姓到宫殿中来哭灵。

朝廷中应参加葬礼的，只能在早晚与大功时可以有哭泣的哀音。礼毕就停止。

不是早晚与举行葬礼时，禁止擅自放声哭泣。

下棺后，服大功(丧服)十五日，小功十四日，细布衣七日，三十六天以后全部释去孝服。

其他有关事项在令中没提及的，都以此令类推。

布告天下，使明知朕意。

霸陵川山按其原貌，不要另造坟陵。

宫中夫人以下的都遣送归家。”

令中尉周亚夫为车骑将军，属国悍为将屯将军，郎中令张武为陵墓复土将军。征发近县士卒一万六千人，内史卒一万五千人，交给张武将军从事开挖墓井与复土回填工作。

赐各王侯以下至孝悌力田的人金钱帛各若干。

六月初七日，葬于霸陵。

班固评论：孝文皇帝在位二十三年，宫殿御苑车骑服御无所增加。

当百姓感到不便时，常放开禁令以利百姓。

他曾想造一座报时辰的露台，召工匠预算，造价需百金。

文帝说：“百金是中等人家十户的产业。

我继守先帝的宫室，常恐有所玷污，何必要筑露台！”

身穿黑色绨衣，所宠爱的慎夫人衣长不拖地，帷帐不绣花，以表示自己的敦朴，为天下的表率。

修造霸陵陵墓，都用瓦器，不准以金银铜锡装饰，因山起陵，不另选坟。

南越尉佗自立为帝，文帝贵封尉佗兄弟，以德义进行感召，佗又重新称臣。

与匈奴结为友好，不久匈奴背约入盗，文帝只令边兵加强防守，不发兵反攻其地，恐增加百姓负担。

吴王诈称病不朝，文帝赏以几杖进行慰问。

群臣袁盎等虽极力谏说不应为吴王所欺，文帝仍将几杖送给吴王使用。

张武等受贿金钱，发觉后，更加赏赐，使其惭愧自省。

文帝专务以德化民，是以四海殷富，大兴礼义之风，断狱仅数百人，几乎到刑罚不用。

唉，仁德之帝啊！</div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>English</h3>
          <div class="txt">Emperor Hsiao-wen was a son of Kao-tsu, neither the oldest nor the youngest. His mother was called the Concubine [née] Po.

In the eleventh year of Kao-tsu, [Emperor Kao-tsu] executed Ch'en Hsi, pacified the region of Tai, and made [his son Heng] the King of Tai, with his capital at Chung-tu.

In the seventeenth year [of Liu Heng's reign as King of Tai], in the autumn, the Empress of Kao-[tsu] died. The [members of] the Lü [clan] plotted to make a rebellion, wishing to endanger the Liu clan.

The Lieutenant Chancellor, Ch'en P'ing, the Grand Commandant, Chou P'o, the Marquis of Chu-hsü, Liu Chang, and others together executed them, [then] planned to set up the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, as the next emperor].

A discussion [of the foregoing matters] is found in the "Annals of the Empress of Kao-[tsu]" and in the "Memoirs of the Five Kings [Who Were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]."

The great officials thereupon sent some people to invite the King of Tai to come.

His Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Chang Wu, and others discussed [the matter] and all said, "The great officials of the Han [court] were all generals of the time of the deceased Emperor Kao-[tsu], are experienced in military affairs, and [use] many stratagems and deceits. Their intentions [may] not stop with this [proposal]. They feared only the majesty of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the Empress Dowager [née] Lü.

Now they have executed the [members of] the Lü [clan] and have newly tasted blood in the capital. They use [this] invitation to you, great King, as a pretext; in reality they cannot be trusted.

We hope that you will announce yourself ill and not go [to the capital], in order to watch their moves."

The Palace Military Commander [of Tai], Sung Ch'ang, stepped forward and said, "The opinion of the courtiers is wrong.

When the Ch'in [dynasty] lost its control, braves and heroes arose together, each one [of whom] thought he would obtain [the imperial throne]—they could be counted by the ten thousands. Nevertheless the person who finally mounted the throne of the Son of Heaven was of the Liu clan. [These ambitious people of] the world have given up any hopes [of attaining that throne. The foregoing is] the first point.

"The Emperor Kao-[tsu] made kings of his sons and kinsmen. Their territories interlock like the teeth of a dog; they are what may be called, `being founded on a rock.' The world has submitted to their power. [The foregoing is] the second point.

"When the Han [dynasty] arose, it did away with the vexatiousness and harshness of the Ch'in [dynasty], reduced [the number of] their laws and ordinances, and showed its virtue and bounty. Everyone is satisfied, and it would be hard to move or shake [them from their allegiance to the Han dynasty. The foregoing is] the third point.

"Moreover, although, by means of her power, the Empress Dowager [née] Lü established three kings from the Lü [clan] and arrogated to herself the [imperial] power, [issuing imperial] decrees on her own authority, yet when the Grand Commandant [Chou P'o] by means of one credential entered the Northern Army and once gave a call, the soldiers all bared their left arms [to show that they were] for the Liu clan, rebelled against the Lü [clan], and finally, for this reason, exterminated [the Lü clan].

This [triumph] then was bestowed by Heaven, it was not [achieved] by human power.

Although the great officials should now wish to do something else [than seat as emperor a scion of the Liu clan], the people would not permit themselves to be used by them; how could their faction [seize] the sole power?

Inside [the capital] there are your relatives, [the Marquis of] Chu-hsü, [Liu Chang], and [the Marquis of] Tung-mou, [Liu Hsing-chü]; outside [the capital they would have to] fear the power of [the kingdoms of] Wu, Ch'u, Huai-nan, Lang-ya, Ch'i, and Tai.

Just now of the sons of the Emperor Kao-[tsu], there are only the King of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang] and yourself, great King. You, great King, are moreover the elder [of the two]. Your ability, your sageness, your paternal love, and your filial piety are known all over the world; hence the great officials are following the hopes of the world in desiring to welcome and establish you, great King, [on the imperial throne]. You, great King, should not have any doubts."

The King of Tai reported [the matter] to his Queen Dowager. They discussed it, [but] hesitated and did not reach a decision.

[Then] they divined about it by means of the tortoise-shell. The lines obtained were the `great transversal.'

The interpretation was: "The `great transversal' [means] a great change. I [the recipient of the oracle] will be the Heavenly King. [Emperor] Ch'i of the Hsia [dynasty] thereby [likewise] glorified [his ancestors by continuing the dynasty]."

The King of Tai said, "I am of course already a king; how could I again be made a king?"

The diviner replied, "By this phrase, `the Heavenly King,' is [meant] however the Son of Heaven."

Thereupon the King of Tai then sent Po Chao, the younger brother of his Queen Dowager, to see the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o and the others told him all their reasons for inviting and seating the King [of Tai on the imperial throne.

Po] Chao returned and reported, "They are indeed trustworthy. There is nothing suspicious."

The King of Tai laughingly said to Sung Ch'ang, "It is really as you, sir, said."

Then he ordered Sung Ch'ang to be his Chariot Companion, Chang Wu and others, six persons in all, to ride in six `riding chariots,' and went to Ch'ang-an. When he came to Kao-ling, he stopped and sent Sung Ch'ang ahead to Ch'ang-an to observe how things had turned.

When [Sung] Ch'ang reached the Wei [River] Bridge, all [the officials, including] the Lieutenant Chancellor and [those ranking] below [him], welcomed [Sung] Ch'ang.

He returned and reported; then the King of Tai advanced to the Wei [River] Bridge.

[There] the officials bowed and paid their respects to him, calling themselves his subjects. The King of Tai got down [from his carriage] and bowed to them.

The Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, advanced and said, "I wish to beg for a word in private."

Sung Ch'ang replied, "If what you have to say is of public [interest], say it publicly; if what you have to say is of private [concern], a [true] king has no private [interests]."

The Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o then knelt and offered the imperial seal [and credentials] of the Son of Heaven.

The King of Tai refused them and said, "Let us go to the prince's lodge and discuss this matter."

In the intercalary month on [the day] chi-yu, [the King of Tai, Liu Heng,] entered the prince's lodge of Tai.

The courtiers followed him to [the lodge]. They presented [the results of] their discussion, saying, "The Lieutenant Chancellor your subject [Ch'en] P'ing, the Grand Commandant your subject [Chou] P'o, the General-in-chief your subject [Kuan Ying], the Grandee Secretary your subject [Chang] Ts'ang, the Superintendant of the Imperial House your subject [Liu] Ying-[k'o], the Marquis of Chu-hsü your subject [Liu] Chang, the Marquis of Tung-mou your subject [Liu] Hsing-chü, and the Director of Guests your subject [Liu] Chieh, making repeated obeisances, say to your Highness the great King: the [Imperial] Sons [Lü] Hung and the others are all not sons of Emperor Hsiao-hui and have no right to have charge of [the worship in] the [imperial] ancestral temples.

Your subjects have respectfully begged the Marquise of Yin-an, the Queen of King Ch'ing, the King of Lang-ya [Liu Tse], the marquises, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs to discuss [this matter, and we all say]: You, great King, are the son of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and are the proper [person] to be his successor. We hope that you, great King, will take the throne of the Son of Heaven."

The King of Tai replied, "The upholding [of the worship] in the Temple of Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the [imperial] ancestral temples is a weighty matter.

I am lacking in ability and am not the person suitable [for this task].

I hope that you will ask the King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao] to consider who is suitable. I personally do not dare to undertake [this task]."

While all the courtiers prostrated themselves and insistently begged him.

the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, then] facing the west, refused thrice, and, when facing the south, refused twice.

The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, and the others all said, "Your subjects have humbly deliberated over this [matter]. You, great King, are the most suitable and capable [person] to receive [charge of] the Temple of Kao-tsu and the [imperial] ancestral temples. Even though the nobles and the people of the world all consider you suitable.

we, your servants, who have been planning for the sake of the [dynasty's] ancestral temples and the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, have not dared to be careless.

We hope that you, great King, will favor us by listening to your servants.

Your servant, respectfully holding the seals and the credentials of the Son of Heaven, making repeated obeisances, presents them [to you]."

The King of Tai said, "If the imperial house, the generals, the chancellors, the kings, and the marquises consider that there is no one more suitable than myself, I would not dare to refuse."

Thereupon he took the throne of the Son of Heaven.

The courtiers arranged themselves by him in accordance with their rank.

They sent the Chief of the Stud, [Hsia-hou] Ying, and the Marquis of Tung-mou, [Liu] Hsing-chü, first to clear the palace. [Then] they presented the prescribed equipage for the Son of Heaven and went to meet [the new Emperor] at the Prince's Lodge of Tai.

The Emperor, on the same day, at sundown, entered the Wei-yang Palace.

That night he installed Sung Ch'ang as General of the Guards, commanding the Southern and Northern Armies, and Chang Wu as Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace. [The Emperor] walked through the [Palace] Halls, [then] returned and seated himself [on the throne] in the Front Hall.

and issued an edict, which said, "An imperial edict of decree to the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en P'ing], the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o, and the Grandee Secretary [Chang Ts'ang]. In the interval [since the last legitimate ruler], the Lü [clan] has been directing affairs, arbitrarily assuming the [imperial] authority, and plotting to commit treason, [thereby] seeking to endanger the ancestral temples of the Liu clan. Thanks to the generals, the chancellors, the marquises, the imperial house, and the great ministers, [the Lü clan] have been executed and have all suffered for their crimes.

We have newly ascended the throne. Let there be an amnesty [granted] to the world and let there be granted to the common people one step in [noble] rank and to the women of a hundred households an ox and wine, and [let there be universal] drinking for five days."

In his first year, in the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] hsin-hai, the Emperor was presented in the temple of Kao-[tsu].

He sent the General of Chariots and Cavalry Po Chao to go to the Empress Dowager at Tai and invite her [to come to the capital].

An imperial edict said, "Formerly Lü Ch'an set himself up as Chancellor of State, [set up] Lü Lu as First [Ranking] General and unauthorizedly sent General Kuan Ying with troops to attack [the army of] Ch'i, wishing to substitute [the Lü clan] for the Liu clan.

[Kuan] Ying remained at Jung-yang and planned in unison with the nobles to execute the Lü clan.

Lü Ch'an wished to do evil things, [but] the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en] P'ing together with the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o and others planned to snatch away the army of [Lü] Ch'an and the others.

The Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, was at the head [of the cabal] and first arrested and beheaded [Lü] Ch'an.

the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o in person led the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, [Chi] T'ung, who held a credential and bore a [false] imperial edict [ordering Chou P'o] to enter [and take command of] the Northern Army.

The Director of Guests [Liu] Chieh took away Lü Lu's seal.

Let there be added to the estate of the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o ten thousand households and [let him be] granted [the equivalent of] five thousand catties of gold.

to the estate of the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en] P'ing and of General [Kuan] Ying each [let there be added] three thousand households and [let them be granted the equivalent of] two thousand catties of gold.

to the estates of the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, [Chi] T'ung, [and the Marquis of Tung-mou, Liu Hsing-chü], to each [let there be added] two thousand households and [let them be granted the equivalent of] a thousand catties of gold.

Let the Director of Guests [Liu] Chieh be appointed as the Marquis of Yang-hsin and be granted [the equivalent of] a thousand catties of gold."

In the twelfth month, [the Emperor] made [Liu] Sui, the son of King Yu of Chao [Liu Yu], the King of Chao. He had shifted the King of Lang-ya, [Liu] Tse, to be the King of Yen.

The territory that the Lü clan had taken away from [the kingdoms of] Ch'i and Ch'u was all returned to [those kingdoms].

[The Emperor] completely abrogated all the statutes and orders for the arresting of wives and children and punishing them with [the criminal].

In the first month the [high] officials begged [the Emperor] to name his Heir-apparent soon, so as to honor the ancestral temples.

His imperial edict read, "Since We are without virtue, the Lords on High and the gods have not enjoyed Our sacrifices [to them] and the people of the empire have not satisfied their desires.

Now even if I cannot search through the empire thoroughly for the [most] capable, sage, and virtuous man [to whom I might] resign the empire, yet, to speak of appointing my Heir-apparent before hand is to double my lack of virtue.

What shall I say to the empire [in justification of such an act]? Be satisfied [with the present situation]."

The [high] officials replied, "To appoint an heir-apparent beforehand is the means whereby to be mindful of the ancestral temples and the gods of the soils and grains and not neglect the empire."

The Emperor said, "The King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao] is my youngest uncle; since he is advanced in years, he has seen much of the justice and natural law of the world and has a clear understanding of the constitution of the state.

The King of Wu [Liu P'i] is to Us as an older brother. The King of Huai-nan [Liu Chang] is [Our] younger brother. All of them are embracing virtue. [If one of these three men] were made to reinforce Us, would not that be adequate [provision for upholding the ancestral temples and the gods]?

Among the vassal kings, the imperial house, my older and younger brothers [and cousins], and my meritorious subjects, there are many who are capable and also virtuous and just; if you select one who is virtuous to reinforce [Us] in doing what We cannot accomplish, that would be a blessing from the gods of the soils and grains and a [piece of] good fortune for the empire.

Now you do not select and present [one of them], but say that [the heir] must be [Our] son, [so that] people will think that We have neglected the capable and virtuous, think only of [Our] sons, which is not the way to care about the empire.

We will certainly not adopt [this procedure]."

The [high] officials insistently begged [the Emperor], saying, "In ancient times, when the Yin and Chou [dynasties] possessed their states, good order and peace [reigned], and they both [lasted] for almost a thousand years. [The reason that] none of [the dynasties] who possessed the empire [lasted] as long [as they] is because they used this method.

The source [of the practise] of always making one's successor a son is already very distant.

Emperor Kao-[tsu], who first pacified the empire and established the nobles, is the Great Founder of emperors.

The vassal kings and marquises who first received their kingdoms are also the founders for their kingdoms.

Their sons and grandsons will succeed them from generation to generation without end. This is the greatest moral and political principle in the world.

Hence Emperor Kao-[tsu] established [this principle] in order that they might [continue] to govern the whole world.

Now to pass by one who is suitable to be appointed and select someone else from the nobles or the imperial house is not the will of Emperor Kao-[tsu].

To deliberate over a change [of the heir] is inappropriate.

Your son Ch'i is your eldest; he is sincere, liberal, kind, and benevolent. We beg that you appoint him as your Heir-apparent."

The Emperor thereupon consented [to do so].

Then he granted one step in noble rank to those people in the empire who would be the successors of their fathers.

He appointed General Po Chao as Marquis of Chih.

In the third month, the [high] officials begged [the Emperor] to appoint the Empress.

The Empress Dowager said, "[The Emperor] should make the mother of the Heir-apparent, [the lady] née Tou, the Empress."

An imperial edict said, "Just now it is spring, when [nature] is harmonious, and the plants and trees and all living beings have means of enjoying themselves, yet [among] my subjects there are widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, distressed and suffering people, and some at the point of death, but no one goes to look after their suffering.

What should those who are the fathers and mothers of the common people do [about this situation]? Let it be discussed what are the means to aid and lend to them."

[The edict] also said, "Unless the aged have silk, they will not be warm; unless they have meat, they will not be well-nourished.

Now at the beginning of the year, if [We] do not at the right moment send people to visit and ask about [the health of] the elders and aged, nor make grants of [linen] cloth, [plain] silk, wine, or meat [to these people], in what way can [We] assist the children and grandchildren of the empire in filial piety to care for their relatives?

"Now [We] have heard that officials when giving grain to those who should receive gruel sometimes use stale millet. How can this befit the intention of caring for the aged? For all these matters [you should prepare] ordinances."

The [high] officials begged that [the Emperor] order that [in the] prefectures and marches those in their eightieth [year] and above should be granted per person per month one picul of rice, twenty catties of meat, five tou of wine.

and that those in their ninetieth [year] and above should also be granted per person two bolts of silk and three catties of silk wadding.

For those to whom should be given goods or a grain allowance of gruel or rice, the chief officials [of the prefecture] should supervise it and the Assistant [Prefect] or Chief of Police should transmit it.

For those who are not fully ninety [years of age], the Inspector of Fields, the Prefect, or an official should transmit it.

The [officials whose positions rank at] two thousand piculs should send their Director of Officials to travel about [inspecting]; those who are unworthy should be beaten.

To those who have suffered mutilating punishments together with those who have committed crimes [deserving the punishment of] shaving the whiskers or more serious [crimes], this order should not apply.

[In this month] King Yüan of Ch'u, [Liu] Chiao, died.

In the fourth month there was an earthquake in Ch'i and Ch'u. Twenty-nine mountains collapsed on the same day and floods came out from their sides or welled up.

In the sixth month [the Emperor] ordered that the commanderies and kingdoms should not come [to the capital] to make offerings [of tribute].

He showed his grace to the world and the nobles and the barbarians [of the] four [quarters], both far and near, rejoiced and were agreeable.

Then [the Emperor] provided for those meritorious persons who came [with him] from [the kingdom of] Tai.

His imperial edict said, "At the time when the great officials had executed the Lü [clan] and invited Us [to take the throne], We were hesitant and suspicious like a fox. All [Our officials] stopped Us. Only [Our] Palace Military Commander, Sung Ch'ang, urged Us [to go]. We have therefore been able to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples.

We have already elevated [Sung] Ch'ang to be General of the Guards. Let [Sung] Ch'ang be appointed as Marquis of Chuang-wu"

and let the six officials who came with Us [be elevated] to [the rank of] the nine great ministers.

[The edict] also said, "The marquises who followed the Emperor Kao-[tsu] into Shu and Han were sixty-eight persons; for each [one of them let there be] added to their estates three hundred families. [Among] the officials [of positions ranking as worth] two thousand piculs and above who followed the Emperor Kao-[tsu, let there be given to] the Administrator of Ying-ch'uan, Tsun, and others, ten persons [in all], the income of six hundred families; to the Administrator of Huai-yang, Shen-t'u Chia, and others, ten persons [in all, the income of] five hundred families; to the Commandant of the [Palace] Guard, Tsu, and others, ten persons [in all, the income of] four hundred families."

[The Emperor] appointed Chao Chien, the maternal uncle of the King of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang], as Marquis of Chou-yang, Szu Chün, the maternal uncle of the King of Ch'i [Liu Hsiang], as Marquis of Ching-kuo, and Ts'ai Chien, the former Lieutenant Chancellor of the [former kingdom of] Ch'ang-shan, as Marquis of Fan.

In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, the Lieutenant Chancellor, Ch'en P'ing, died.

An imperial edict said, "We have heard that anciently the nobles, for whom there were established more than a thousand states, each [actually] governed his own territory and at the [proper] time paid tribute [to the sovereign. Then] the people were not harassed or made to suffer; the superior and inferiors were content and rejoiced; there was no one who transgressed against virtue.

[But] now the marquises mostly live in Ch'ang-an, far from their estates, [so that] their officials and retainers who transport [to them their taxes and provisions] are put to expense and suffering. Moreover the marquises have thus no means of instructing and teaching their people.

Let it be ordered that the marquises are to go to their states. As to [those who are imperial] officials, together with those who are retained [at the court] by an imperial edict, they shall send their heirs-apparent [to their states]."

In the eleventh month, on [the day] kuei-mao, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "We have heard that when Heaven gave birth to the common people, it established princes for them to take care of and govern them.

When the lord of men is not virtuous and his dispositions in his government are not equable, Heaven then informs him [of that fact] by a calamitous visitation, in order to forewarn him that he is not governing [rightly].

Now on the last day of the eleventh month there was an eclipse of the sun—a reproach visible in the sky—what visitation could be greater?

"We have secured [the position as] guardian of the [imperial] ancestral temples; with a feeble and insignificant person [We] have been entrusted with a place above the educated and common people and the princes and kings. The good or bad government of the world depends upon Ourself. Even the two or three [persons] administering the government are like my legs and arms.

Below Us, [We] have not been able to govern well and nurture the multitude of beings; above [Us, We] have thereby affected the brilliance of the three luminaries. This lack of virtue has been great indeed.

"Wherever this order arrives, let all think what are Our faults and errors together with the inadequacies of Our knowledge and discernment. We beg that you will inform and tell Us of it.

and also present [to Us] those capable and good persons who are foursquare and upright and are able to speak frankly and unflinchingly admonish [Us], so as to correct Our inadequacies.

[Let] everyone be therefore diligent in his office and duties. Take care to lessen [the amount of] forced service and expense in order to benefit the people.

"Since We are unable to [spread the influence of Our] virtue to distant [regions], with anxiety [We] reflect on the iniquitous conduct of foreigners, against whom, therefore, [We] have made preparations without ceasing.

Now although [We] are unable to dismiss the encampments and garrison soldiers at the border, [need We] also be attentive to [Our personal] troops and make Our guard large? Let the army of the General of the Guard be abolished.

Of the horses which the Chief of the Stud has now, [let] there remain just enough; [let] all the remainder be given for the posts and post-horses."

In the spring, the first month, on [the day] ting-hai, an imperial edict said, "Now agriculture is the foundation of the world. Let the sacred field be opened. We Ourself lead in plowing in order to provide millet and grain offerings for the [imperial] ancestral temple.

Those people who are punished [and made to] work in the prefectural offices, together with those who have borrowed seed and food, and have not paid it back, and those who have not paid in full, [let] them all be pardoned."

In the second month, some [high] officials begged [the Emperor] to establish his Imperial Sons as vassal kings.

His imperial edict said, "Previously when King Yu of Chao, [Liu Yu], died from being imprisoned, We deeply sympathized with him. [We] have already made his Heir-apparent, [Liu] Sui, the King of Chao.

The younger brother of [Liu] Sui, [Liu] Pi-ch'iang, together with the sons of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], the Marquis of Chu-hsü, [Liu] Chang, and the Marquis of Tung-mou, [Liu] Hsing-chü, are meritorious [persons] and worthy to be made kings."

So [the Emperor] thereupon established [Liu] Pi-ch'iang as the King of Ho-chien, [Liu] Chang as the King of Ch'eng-yang, and [Liu] Hsing-chü as the King of Chi-pei.

Because of [those appointments], he established his Imperial Sons, [Liu] Wu as the King of Tai, [Liu] Ts'an as the King of T'ai-yüan, and [Liu] Yi as the King of Liang.

In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "According to the ancient [mode of] governing the world, in the court there was the banner for initiating improvements, and the post for speaking ill and criticizing, whereby there was kept open the way for [good] government and [whereby] remonstrances were caused to come [to the Emperor]. Now in the law there are the crimes of speaking evil and criticizing and of monstrous speech. These [laws] keep the courtiers from daring to express their whole feelings so that the sovereign has no means of hearing about his mistakes and errors.

By what means then [can we make] capable and good [people] from distant quarters come [to Us]? Let [these laws] be abrogated.

"If it happens that people make imprecations against the sovereign and have made pledges to each other, but later give each other the lie, the officials consider it treason, and, whatever else they may say, the officials nevertheless consider it speaking evil and criticizing.

These [acts] are from the stupidity of unimportant people, who do not know [what they are doing] and run into death. [Such punishments are what] We very much do not want.

From the present time on, whenever there are those who transgress in this manner, do not admit them to trial."

In the ninth month, there were first made for the Administrators of Commanderies bronze tiger credentials and envoy's bamboo credentials.

An imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the great foundation of the world; it is what the people depend on for their [very] life. Nevertheless the people sometimes do not apply themselves to the fundamental but occupy themselves with what is least [important]. As a result their livelihood is deficient.

We are anxious about this state of affairs, hence We now at this time Ourselves lead [Our] ministers in agricultural [pursuits] in order to exhort them [to stress agriculture in their government].

Let there be granted to the people of the empire this year half of the land tax on the cultivated fields."

In the third year, in the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] ting-yu, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the eleventh month, on [the day] ting-mao, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

The imperial edict said, "Sometime ago an imperial edict ordered the marquises to go to their states. [But they asked] to be excused and have not gone.

The Lieutenant Chancellor is [the person] whom We honor [most]. Let him lead the marquises to their states for Us."

Thereupon the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Chou] P'o, was dismissed and sent to go to his state.

In the twelfth month, the Grand Commandant, the Marquis of Ying-yin, Kuan Ying, was made Lieutenant Chancellor and the office of Grand Commandant was abolished; [his duties] were taken care of by the Lieutenant Chancellor.

In the summer, the fourth month, the King of Ch'eng-yang, [Liu] Chang, died.

The King of Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch'ang, killed the Marquis of Pi-yang, Shen Yi-chi.

In the fifth month, the Huns entered and occupied the Pei-ti [Commandery], south of the [Yellow] River, whence they marauded.

The Emperor favored the Kan-ch'üen [Palace by visiting it. The Emperor] sent the Lieutenant Chancellor Kuan Ying to attack the Huns, and the Huns left.

[The Emperor] sent the Palace Military Commander, with skilled soldiers belonging to [the army of] the General of the Guard, to encamp at Ch'ang-an.

The Emperor went from the Kan-ch'üan [Palace] to Kao-nu, and, availing himself of the opportunity, he favored [the kingdom of] T'ai-yüan [by visiting it] and saw his former officials. He granted [favors] to them all.

promoting those who had distinguished themselves. He gave favors to the common people, granting them by hamlets an ox and wine.

He exempted the people of Chin-yang and Chung-tu from the land tax for three years.

He stayed and amused himself in [the kingdom of] T'ai-yüan for more than ten days.

When the King of Chi-pei, [Liu] Hsing-chü, heard that the Emperor had gone to Tai and that he himself intended to attack the Huns, [the king] rebelled and mobilized his troops, wishing to surprise Jung-yang.

Thereupon an imperial edict abolished the troops of the Lieutenant Chancellor and made the Marquis of Chi-p'u, Ch'ai Wu, the General-in-chief, leading four generals [with] a multitude [numbering] a hundred thousand to attack [Liu Hsing-chü].

The Marquis of Ch'i, Tseng Ho, was made a General and encamped at Jung-yang.

In the autumn, the seventh month, the Emperor [went] from T'ai-yüan to Ch'ang-an.

His edict read, "The King of Chi-pei [Liu Hsing-chü] has been ungrateful for [Our] goodness, rebelled against his sovereign, deceived and led into error his officials and people, and committed treason.

Those among the officials and people of Chi-pei who stopped [rebelling] of their own accord before the troops arrived and those who submitted together with their army, their cities, or their towns, are all to be pardoned and restored to their official [positions] and their [aristocratic] ranks.

Those who have been with the King, [Liu] Hsing-chü, leave him, and come [to Us] will also be pardoned."

In the eighth month the King of Chi-pei, [Liu] Hsing-chü, was captured and committed suicide.

[The Emperor] pardoned those who had rebelled with [Liu] Hsing-chü.

In the fourth year, in the winter, the twelfth month, the Lieutenant Chancellor Kuan Ying died.

In the summer, the fifth month, [the Emperor] exempted from all taxes the families of the [members of the] Liu [house] who had members enregistered [as belonging to the imperial house].

He granted estates to the sons of the vassal kings, to each [the income of] two thousand households.

In the autumn, the ninth month, [the Emperor] appointed ten sons of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], as marquises.

The Marquis of Chiang, Chou P'o, committed crime; he was arrested and brought to the Imperial Prison of the Commandant of Justice.

The Ku-ch'eng Temple was built.

In the fifth year, in the spring, the second month, there was an earthquake.

In the summer, the fourth month, the order [against] casting counterfeit cash was abrogated. [The coinage] was changed and four shu cash were made.

In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the peach and plum [trees] blossomed.

In the eleventh month, the King of Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch'ang, plotted a rebellion, was dismissed, exiled to Yen-tao in the Shu [Commandery], and died [on the way] at Yung.

In the seventh year, in the winter, the tenth month, [the Emperor] ordered that Dowager Marchionesses, wives of marquises, sons of vassal kings, together with officials [with positions ranking as worth] two thousand piculs, were not arbitrarily to make levies nor arrests.

In the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty was granted to the world.

In the sixth month, on [the day] kuei-yu, there was a visitation [of fire] in the towers screening the Eastern Portal of the Wei-yang Palace.

In the eighth year, in the summer, [the Emperor] enfeoffed as marquises the four sons of King Li of Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch'ang.

A long comet appeared in the eastern quarter [of the sky].

In the ninth year, in the spring, there was a great drought.

In the tenth year, in the winter, [the Emperor] travelled and favored [by a visit] the Kan-ch'üan [Palace].

General Po Chao died.

In the eleventh year, in the winter, the eleventh month, [the Emperor] travelled and favored [the kingdom of] Tai [with a visit].

In the spring, the first month, the Emperor returned from [the kingdom of] Tai [to the capital].

In the summer, the sixth month, the King of Liang, [Liu] Yi, died.

The Huns pillaged Ti-tao.

In the twelfth year, in the winter, the twelfth month, the [Yellow] River broke [its dykes] in the Tung Commandery.

In the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] granted estates of two thousand families to each of the daughters of the vassal kings.

In the second month, the Beauties in the Emperor Hsiao-hui's harem were sent [home] and it was ordered that they might be married.

In the third month, the [customs] barriers were done away with and passports were no [longer] used.

An imperial edict said, "The road along which to guide the people is [to make them] devote themselves to fundamentals.

We Ourselves have led the world in agriculture for ten years down to the present, yet to the countryside there has not been added any newly broken land.

and [as soon as] one year has not a good harvest, the people have hungry looks. This [shows that] those who apply themselves to [agriculture] are still too few, and that moreover the officials have not especially put their attention on it.

I have many times put forth edicts, and yearly have urged the people to plant and sow, but the results [of my action] have not yet appeared. This is [because] the officials have not been diligent in upholding my edicts or [because] they have not been intelligent in urging the people [to agriculture].

Forsooth, my farmers [have suffered] very bitterly, and yet the officials have perceived none of it; how then can [the officials effectively] encourage [agriculture]?

Let there be granted to the farmers this year half of the land tax and tax on produce."

[The edict] also said, "The Filially Pious and the Fraternally Respectful are the most advantageous [persons] in the world. The Cultivators of the Fields are the fundamental sources of life. The San-lao are the teachers of the people. Honest officials are an example to the people.

We greatly approve of the conduct of these few [kinds of] grandees.

"Now in prefectures of ten thousand families it is said, `There are none who [are able to] conform to [the Emperor's] order.' How can peoples' natures be really [so inadequate]?

This is because the way the officials have of recommending the capable is not adequate.

Let Internuncios be sent to recompense and make grants: to the San-lao and the Filially Pious, five pieces of silk per person, to the Fraternally Respectful and the Cultivators of the Fields, two pieces, to the honest officials of [the rank of] two thousand piculs and above, for every hundred piculs, three pieces.

When [the Internuncio] arrives, [let him] ask the people if there is anything inconvenient or discontenting, and let him establish the regular number of San-lao, Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Cultivators of the Fields in accordance with the number of households and people, and order each to apply himself with all his mind in order to guide the people [aright]."

In the thirteenth year, in the spring, the second month, on [the day] chia-yin, an imperial edict said, "We Ourself lead the world in farming and plowing in order to offer millet and sacrificial grain [in sacrifice]. The Empress herself raises silk-worms in order to provide sacrificial clothing. Let ceremonies and rites be established [for these procedures]."

In the summer, [the Emperor] abolished the secret invocator. A discussion is in the "Treatise on the Suburban Sacrifice and Offerings to the Spirits."

In the fifth month, [the Emperor] abolished the law providing for mutilating punishments. A discussion is in the "Treatise on Punishments and Laws."

In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the foundation of the world. No duty is greater.

Now if [anyone] personally follows this pursuit diligently, he has yet [to pay] the impositions of the land tax and tax on produce. This is making no distinction between [the treatment of what is] fundamental and [what is] least important. This is not appropriate to [Our] way of encouraging agriculture.

Let there be abolished the land tax and tax on produce [levied] upon the [cultivated] fields.

and let there be granted to the orphans and widows of the empire [linen] cloth, silk, and silk wadding, to each person a definite amount."

In the fourteenth year, in the winter, the Huns pillaged at the frontier and killed the Chief Commandant of the Pei-ti [Commandery], [Sun] Ang.

[The Emperor] sent three generals to encamp in the Lung-hsi, the Pei-ti, and the Shang Commanderies. The Palace Military Commander Chou Shê was made General of the Guard; the Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace Chang Wu was made General of Chariots and Cavalry to encamp north of the Wei [River] with a thousand chariots and a hundred thousand cavalry and foot-soldiers.

The Emperor himself inquired about the army's welfare and aroused the troops by reiterated instructions and orders and by making grants to the officers and soldiers.

He himself wanted to make the expedition against the Huns. When the courtiers remonstrated, he would not listen.

[but] when the Empress Dowager earnestly besought him, the Emperor however stopped.

Thereupon [the Emperor] made the Marquis of Tung-yang, Chang Hsiang-ju, the General-in-chief. The Marquis of Ch'eng, Tung Ch'ih, the Prefect of the Capital, and Luan Pu were both made generals to attack the Huns. The Huns fled.

In the spring, an imperial edict said, "It is now the fourteenth year that We have had [the opportunity] to present the sacrificial oxen, the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk for the service of the Lords on High and the [imperial] ancestral temples.

As the elapsed time has become longer and longer, and [We] have been neither intelligent nor brilliant, yet have controlled and governed the world for a long time, We Ourselves are very much ashamed [because We are unworthy].

Let there be extended and augmented the mounds on which sacrifices are made, the level places for sacrifice, the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk at the various sacrifices.

"Formerly the ancient Kings extended [their benefits] far and wide and did not seek for any recompense; they performed the sacrifice from a distance [to the great mountains and rivers], but did not pray for their own happiness.

In the place of honor were the sages, in the less honorable place were their relatives; The people [came] first, they put themselves last; [this was] the extreme of the utmost wisdom.

Now I have heard that when the sacrificial officials pray for happy omens, they all [endeavor to make] happiness revert upon Our private person, and do not [pray] for [Our] subjects. We are very much ashamed at this.

If now, in spite of Our lack of virtue, [We] nevertheless specially and solely enjoy the good [coming] from their [prayers for] happiness, and my subjects have no share in it, that will double my lack of virtue.

Let it be ordered that the sacrificial officials, in presenting their respectful [offerings], should not beg for anything."

In the fifteenth year, in the spring, a yellow dragon appeared at Ch'eng-chi.

The Emperor thereupon issued an edict [ordering] the discussion of the sacrifice in the suburbs and [other] sacrifices.

Kung-sun Ch'en made clear the colors of the [sacrificial] robes; Hsin-yüan P'ing established the five temples. A discussion [of the foregoing matters] is in the "Treatise on the Suburban Sacrifice and Offerings to the Spirits."

In the summer, the fourth month, the Emperor favored Yung [by a visit] and for the first time was presented to the Five Lords [on High] by means of a suburban sacrifice. An amnesty [was granted] to the world.

[The Emperor] renewed the sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers, which had been worshipped and whose [sacrifices] had been stopped. The officers charged therewith [were ordered to] perform the [proper] rites [at the right time of] the year and season.

In the ninth month, an imperial edict [ordered] the vassal kings, the ministers, and the commandery administrators to present [to the Emperor] those who were capable and good, and could speak frankly and admonish [their superiors] unflinchingly. The Emperor in person questioned them [by setting a literary exercise]. They set forth in [written] words their ideas for adoption. A discussion is in the "Memoir of Ch'ao Ts'o."

In the sixteenth year, in the summer, the fourth month, the Emperor made a suburban sacrifice to the Five Lords [on High] at [the altars] to the north of the Wei [River].

In the fifth month, [the Emperor] appointed six sons of King Tao-hui of Ch'i [Liu Fei], and three sons of King Li of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang], as kings.

In the autumn, the ninth month, there was found a jade cup with the inscription, "Prolonged life to the Lord of Men."

[The Emperor] ordered that universal drinking [should be permitted all over] the empire. The next year [the Emperor] changed the beginning [of the count for the years of his rule].

In the latter [part of his reign], the first year, in the winter, the tenth month, the deceits of Hsin-yüan P'ing were discovered; he plotted rebellion, and was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.

In the spring, the third month, the Empress née Chang of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui died.

An imperial edict said, "Recently for many years there have continually been no good harvests. Moreover there have been visitations of floods, droughts, sickness, and epidemics. We have been very much worried because of them.

We are ignorant and not perspicacious and do not yet understand just what is to blame.

Is it that Our [way of] government has some faults and [Our] conduct has some errors?

Or is it that [We] have not obeyed the Way of Heaven or have perhaps not obtained the advantages of Earth, or are the affairs of men in great discord, or have the spirits and divinities been neglected [so that] they have not enjoyed [Our offerings]?

How has this been brought about?

Or is it that the salaries of the officials are perhaps too lavish, or that useless activities are perhaps too many?

How is it that the people's food is scarce and lacking?

"Now when the fields are measured, they have not decreased, and when the population is counted, it has not increased, [so that] the amount of land per person is greater than in ancient times. Yet there is very much too little food; where does the blame for it lie?

Is it that Our subjects devote themselves to what is least important, whereby those [persons] who injure agriculture are multiplied? [Is it due to the fact that] they make wine and lees, thereby wasting much grain and that masses of food are given to the six [kinds of] domestic animals?

I have not yet been able to attain the proper mean between what is immaterial and what is important.

Let [this matter] be discussed with the Lieutenant Chancellor, the marquises, the officials [of ranks worth] two thousand piculs, and the Erudits. Should there be anything that might be of assistance to Our subjects, let them apply themselves with all their minds and think deeply [about the matter]. Let them not hide anything [from Us]."

In the second year, in the summer, [the Emperor] traveled and favored [by a visit] the Yü-yang Palace at Yung.

In the sixth month, the King of Tai, [Liu] Ts'an, died.

The Huns [asked for] peace and friendship.

The imperial edict said, "Since We are not perspicacious, We have been unable to [extend the influence of Our] virtue to distant [regions]. This has caused states outside the borders sometimes to be disquiet and discontented.

夫四荒之外不安其生，封圻之内勤劳不处，二者之咎，皆自于朕之德薄而不能达远也。

In recent years, the Huns have repeatedly raided the border regions, killing many officials and people. The border ministers and military officers have failed to make clear Our inner intentions, thereby increasing My lack of virtue.

If enmity and warfare persist for a long time, how can both the central and outer states find peace?

Now I rise early and sleep late, toiling for the empire and worrying about the people, feeling compassion and unease, never forgetting this for a single day. Therefore, I have sent envoys with their carriages and hats visible one after another, their wheel tracks unbroken along the road, to make known My intentions to the Shan-yü.

Now the Shan-yü has returned to the ancient way, considering the security of the state and the benefit of the people. He and I have now both abandoned minor wrongs, walked together on the great path, formed a fraternal bond, and thus protected all the people in the world.

Peace and friendship are established, beginning from this year."

In the third year, in the spring, the second month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored [the kingdom of] Tai [with a visit].

In the fourth year, in the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] ping-yin, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.

In the fifth month, an amnesty was granted to the world.

[The Emperor] freed the government male and female slaves and made them ordinary people.

[The Emperor] traveled and favored Yung [with a visit].

In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, [the Emperor] traveled and favored the Lung-hsi [Commandery with a visit].

In the third month, he traveled and favored Yung [with a visit].

In the autumn, the seventh month, he traveled and favored [the kingdom of] Tai [with a visit].

In the sixth year, in the winter, thirty thousand Hun horsemen entered the Shang Commandery and thirty thousand [Hun] horsemen entered the Yün-chung [Commandery].

The Chief of the Palace Grandees, Mien, was made General of Chariots and Cavalry, and stationed at Fei-hu.

the former Chancellor of [the kingdom of] Ch'u, Su Yi, was made a General, and stationed at Chü-chu.

General Chang Wu was stationed in the Pei-ti [Commandery].

the Administrator of Ho-nei, Chou Ya-fu, was made a General and encamped temporarily at Hsi-liu.

the Superintendant of the Imperial House, Liu Li, was made a General and encamped temporarily at Pa-shang.

the Marquis of Chu-tzu, Hsü Li, was made a General and encamped temporarily at Chi-men, in order to be ready for the Hu.

In the summer, the fourth month, there was a great drought and locusts.

[The Emperor] ordered that the nobles should not pay tribute. He opened [to the common people] the mountains and marshes, reduced the [imperial] robes and the imperial officers, diminished the [regular] number of Gentlemen and officials, and opened the granaries in order to succor the people. The people were allowed to sell [aristocratic] ranks.

In the seventh year, in the summer, the sixth month, on [the day] chi-hai, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Palace.

His testamentary decree said, "We have heard it [said that], of all [plants and animals] that sprout from or are born to any of the beings in the world, all of them, it seems, have to die.

Death is a law of Heaven and Earth, and the nature of things. [Then] how could it be [so] greatly lamentable?

"当今之世，咸嘉生而恶死，厚葬以破业，重服以伤生，吾甚不取。

Moreover, since I am not virtuous, I have been unable to assist the people.

Now that I die, if I cause people to wear heavy mourning and mourn for a long time, suffering from the extremes of cold and heat, grieving for their parents and children.

hurting the feelings of the elders, reducing their food and drink, and interrupting the sacrifices to the spirits and divinities, thereby increasing my lack of virtue—what can I say to the world?

I have had the good fortune to protect the ancestral temples, and with my humble person have been entrusted with a position above the kings of the world for more than twenty years.

By the grace of Heaven.

the blessing of the state, the interior is peaceful, and there has been no warfare.

I am not intelligent, and have always feared improper conduct that would disgrace the legacy of virtue left by the former emperors.

As the years have passed, I have feared not being able to end well.

Now I am fortunate to have lived out my natural years and to be able to return to and be供养 in the Temple of Kao-tsu. Though I am not wise, I rejoice in this—what is there to grieve about!

"Order all officials and people in the empire: upon receiving this order, they shall mourn for three days, then all remove their mourning garments.

There shall be no prohibition on taking a wife, marrying off a daughter, offering sacrifices, drinking wine, or eating meat.

Those who must attend the funeral and wear mourning shall not wear unhemmed mourning clothes.

The hemp headbands and girdles shall not be more than three inches wide.

There shall be no display of carriages or weapons.

Do not send people to wail in the palaces.

Those in the palace who must mourn shall wail fifteen times each morning and evening; after the rites, this shall cease.

Except during the morning and evening mourning times, no one shall be allowed to wail without permission.

After the interment, wear heavy mourning for fifteen days, light mourning for fourteen days, and plain clothes for seven days; then remove all mourning garments.

Whatever is not mentioned in this order shall be handled in accordance with the spirit of this order.

Proclaim this to the world so that all clearly understand My will.

The mountains and rivers around the Pa Tomb shall remain as they are; no changes shall be made.

Return all ladies below the rank of夫人 down to the Junior Maids to their homes."

Order the Palace Military Commander [Chou] Ya-fu to be General of Chariots and Cavalry, the [Director of] Dependent States [Hsü] Tao to be General In Charge of Encampments, and the Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace Chang Wu to be the General [In Charge of] Replacing the Earth. Mobilize 16,000 soldiers from neighboring prefectures and 15,000 soldiers from the inner history's office; the tasks of burying the outer coffin, digging, and refilling the earth shall be under the charge of General [Chang] Wu.

Grant gold, cash, and silk to vassal kings and those below them down to the Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and [Diligent] Cultivators of the Soil, each in a specified amount.

On [the day] yi-szu, [the Emperor] was buried in the Pa Tomb.

In eulogy we say: Emperor Hsiao-wen occupied the throne for twenty-three years. In his palaces and apartments, in his pastures and enclosures, in his carriages and saddle-horses, in his garments and daily needs, he made no addition or increase [over the requirements of his predecessors].

If there was [any activity] that was not convenient [for the people], he at once abandoned it in order to benefit his people.

At one time he wanted to make a roofless terrace. He summoned the artisans to count up its [cost], and it would cost [the equivalent of] a hundred [catties of] gold.

The Emperor said, "A hundred [catties of] gold is the estate of ten families of medium [means].

I have received the palaces and apartments of the deceased emperors and have constantly been afraid that I should disgrace them; what is the use of building this terrace?"

He personally dressed in thick black silk. The clothes of his favorite, the Lady [née] Shen, did not trail on the ground. His curtains and canopies had no ornaments or embroidery, thereby showing that in naturalness and simplicity he was the leader of the world.

When he constructed the Pa Tomb, he altogether [used] objects of pottery and did not allow the use of gold, silver, copper, or tin as ornaments. He took advantage of [the rise of] the hill [where] his [grave was built], and did not raise a mound [upon his tomb].

When the Commandant of Nan-yüeh, [Chao] T'o, set himself up as Emperor, [Emperor Wen] summoned and honored [Chao] T'o's older and younger cousins and enveloped them with his goodness; thereupon [Chao] T'o declared himself his subject.

After he had made peace and friendship with the Huns, and they had gone contrary to their covenant and entered [his territory] to rob, he ordered that the borders should prepare for defence, but did not send troops deep into [the Hun territory], for fear of burdening his subjects.

When the King of Wu, [Liu P'i], feigned illness and did not come to court, [the Emperor] granted him a stool and a cane.

When the officials, Yüan Ang and others, remonstrated [with him], although their words were cutting, he often pardoned them, accepted [their advice], and put it into practise.

When Chang Wu and others accepted bribes of gold or cash, and [the fact] was discovered, [the Emperor] gave to them still more presents and grants, in order to shame them.

His sole care was to improve the people by means of his virtue; for this reason [all the country] within the [four] seas was prosperous and opulent and advanced towards proper conduct and right relationships. [During his reign] there were pronounced verdicts [of capital punishment] in [only] several hundred [cases]; [so that he] almost succeeded in setting aside punishments [without using them].

Alas! How benevolent he was!</div>
