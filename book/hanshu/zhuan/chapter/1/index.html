          <div class="txt">王莽字巨君，孝元皇后之弟子也。

后父及兄弟皆以元、成世封侯，居位辅政，家凡九侯、五大司马，语在《元后传》。

唯莽父曼蚤死，不侯。

莽群兄弟皆将军五侯子，乘时侈靡，以舆马声色佚游相高。

莽独孤贫，因折节为恭俭。

受《礼经》，师事沛郡陈参，勤身博学，被服如儒生。

事母及寡嫂，养孤兄子，行甚敕备。

又外交英俊，内事诸父，曲有礼意。

阳朔中，世父大将军凤病，莽侍疾，亲尝药，乱首垢面，不解衣带连月。

凤且死，以托太后及帝，拜为黄门郎，迁射声校尉。

久之，叔父成都侯商上书，愿分户邑以封莽，及长乐少府戴崇、侍中金涉、胡骑校尉箕闳、上谷都尉阳并、中郎陈汤，皆当世名士，咸为莽言，上由是贤莽。

永始元年，封莽为新都侯，国南阳新野之都乡，千五百户。

迁骑都尉、光禄大夫、侍中，宿卫谨敕，爵位益尊，节操愈谦。

散舆马衣裘，振施宾客，家无所余。

收赡名士，交结将相卿大夫甚众。

故在位更推荐之，游者为之谈说，虚誉隆洽，倾其诸父矣。

敢为激发之行，处之不惭恧。

莽兄永为诸曹，蚤死，有子光，莽使学博士门下。

莽休沐出，振车骑，奉羊酒，劳遗其师，恩施下竟同学。

光年小于莽子宇，莽使同日内纳妇，宾客满堂。

须臾，一人言太夫人苦某痛，当饮某药，比客罢者数起焉。

尝私买侍婢，昆弟或颇闻知，莽因曰：“后将军朱子元无子，莽闻此儿种宜子，为买之。”即日以婢奉子元。

其匿情求名如此。

是时，太后姊子淳于长以材能为九卿，先进在莽右。

莽阴求其罪过，因大司马曲阳侯根白之，长伏诛，莽以获忠直，语在《长传》。

根因乞骸骨，荐莽自代，上遂擢为大司马。

是岁，绥和元年也，年三十八矣。

莽既拔出同列，继四父而辅政，欲令名誉过前人，遂克己不倦，聘诸贤良以为掾史，赏赐邑钱悉以享士，愈为俭约。

母病，公卿列侯遣夫人问疾，莽妻迎之，衣不曳地，布蔽膝。

见之者以为僮使，问知其夫人，皆惊。

辅政岁余，成帝崩，哀帝即位，尊皇太后为太皇太后。

太后诏莽就第，避帝外家。

莽上疏乞骸骨，哀帝遣尚书令诏莽曰：“先帝委政于君，君有毁瘁，躬奉养，卒无纤介，今君移病求退，朕甚伤焉。

已诏尚书待君奏事。”

又遣丞相孔光、大司空何武、左将军师丹、卫尉傅喜白太后曰：“皇帝闻太后诏，甚悲。

大司马即不起，皇帝即不敢听政。”

太后复令莽视事。

时哀帝祖母定陶傅太后、母丁姬在，高昌侯董宏上书言：“《春秋》之义，母以子贵，丁姬宜上尊号。”

莽与师丹共劾宏误朝不道，语在《丹传》。

后日，未央宫置酒，内者令为傅太后张幄，坐于太皇太后坐旁。

莽案行，责内者令曰：“定陶太后，藩妾也，何以得与至尊并！”彻去，更设坐。

傅太后闻之，大怒，不肯会，重怨恚莽。

莽复乞骸骨，哀帝赐莽黄金五百斤，安车驷马，罢就第。

公卿大夫多称之者，上乃加恩宠，置使家，中黄门十日一赐餐。

下诏曰：“新都侯莽忧劳国家，执义坚固，朕庶几与为治。

太皇太后诏莽就第，朕甚闵焉。

其以黄邮聚户三百五十益封莽，位特进，给事中，朝朔望，见礼如三公。

车驾乘绿车从。”

后二岁，傅太后、丁姬皆称尊号，丞相朱博奏：“莽前不广尊尊之义，抑贬尊号，亏损孝道，当伏显戮。

幸蒙赦令，不宜有爵土，请免为庶人。”

上曰：“以莽与太皇太后有属，勿免，遣就国。”

莽杜门自守，其中子获杀奴，莽切责获，令自杀。

在国三岁，吏上书冤讼莽者以百数。

元寿元年，日食，贤良周护、宋崇等对策深颂莽功德，上于是征莽。

始莽就国，南阳太守以莽贵重，选门下掾宛孔休守新都相。

休谒见莽，莽尽礼自纳，休亦闻其名，与相答。

后莽疾，休候之，莽缘恩意，进其玉具宝剑，欲以为好。

休不肯受，莽因曰：“诚见君面有瘢，美玉可以灭瘢，欲献其瑑耳。”

即解其瑑，休复辞让。

莽曰：“君嫌其贾邪？”遂椎碎之，自裹以进休，休乃受。

及莽征去，欲见休，休称疾不见。

莽还京师岁余，哀帝崩，无子，而傅太后、丁太后皆先薨，太皇太后即日驾之未央宫收取玺绶，遣使者驰召莽。

诏尚书，诸发兵符节，百官奏事，中黄门、期门兵皆属莽。

莽白太后，徙孝哀皇后退居北宫，收傅氏、丁氏亲属皆免官爵，徙远方。

莽以大司徒孔光名儒，相三主，太后所敬，天下信之，于是盛尊事光，引光女婿甄邯为侍中奉车都尉。

诸哀帝外戚及大臣居位素所不说者，莽皆傅致其罪，为请奏草，令邯持与光。

光素畏慎，不敢不上，莽白太后，辄可其奏。

于是前将军何武、后将军公孙禄坐互相称举，免。

丁、傅及董贤亲属皆免官爵，徙远方。

红阳侯立，太后亲弟，虽不居位，莽以诸父内敬惮之，畏立从容言太后，令己不得肆意，乃复令光奏立旧恶：

“前知定陵侯淳于长犯大逆罪，多受其赂，为言误朝；

后白以官婢杨寄私子为皇子，众言曰吕氏、少帝复出，纷纷为天下所疑，难以示来世，成襁褓之功。

请遣立就国。”

太后不听，莽曰：“今汉家衰，比世无嗣，太后独代幼主统政，诚可畏惧，力用公正先天下，尚恐不从，今以私恩逆大臣议，如此，群下倾邪，乱从此起！

宜可且遣就国，安后复征召之。”

太后不得已，遣立就国。

莽之所以胁持上下，皆此类也。

于是附顺者拔擢，忤恨者诛灭。

王舜、王邑为腹心，甄丰、甄邯主击断，平晏领机事，刘歆典文章，孙建为爪牙。

丰子寻、歆子棻、涿郡崔发、南阳陈崇皆以材能幸于莽。

莽色厉而言方，欲有所为，微见风采，党与承其指意而显奏之，莽稽首涕泣，固推让焉，上以惑太后，下用示信于众庶。

始，风益州令塞外蛮夷献白雉，元始元年正月，莽白太后下诏，以白雉荐宗庙。

群臣因奏言太后：“委任大司马莽定策安宗庙。

故大司马霍光有安宗庙之功，益封三万户，畴其爵邑，比萧相国。

莽宜如光故事。”

太后问公卿曰：“诚以大司马有大功当著之邪？将以骨肉故欲异之也？”

于是群臣乃盛陈：“莽功德致周成白雉之瑞，千载同符。

圣王之法，臣有大功则生有美号，故周公及身在而托号于周。

莽有定国安汉家之大功，宜赐号曰安汉公，益户，畴爵邑，上应古制，下准行事，以顺天心。”

太后诏尚书具其事。

莽上书言：“臣与孔光、王舜、甄丰、甄邯共定策，今愿独条光等功赏，寝置臣莽，勿随辈列。”

甄邯白太后下诏曰：“‘无偏无党，王道荡荡。’

君有安宗庙之功，不可以骨肉故蔽隐不扬。

君其勿辞。”

莽复上书让。

太后令谒者引莽待殿东箱，莽称疾不肯入。

太后使尚书令姚恂谕曰：“君以选故而辞以疾，君任重，不可阙，宜及时起。”

莽遂固辞。

太后复使长信太仆闳承制召莽，莽固称疾。

左右白太后，宜勿夺莽意，但条孔光等，莽乃肯起。

四月，太后下诏曰：“太傅博山侯光宿卫四世，世为傅相，忠考仁笃，行义显著，建议定策，益封万户，以光为太师，与四辅之政。

车骑将军安阳侯舜积累仁孝，使迎中山王，折冲万里，功德茂著，益封万户，以舜为太保。

左将军光禄勋丰宿卫三世，忠信仁笃，使迎中山王，辅导共养，以安宗庙，封丰为广阳侯，食邑五千户，以丰为少傅。

皆授四辅之职，畴其爵邑，各赐第一区。

侍中奉车都尉邯宿卫勤劳，建议定策，封邯为承阳侯，食邑二千四百户。”

四人既受赏，莽尚未起，群臣复上言：“莽虽克让，朝所宜章，以时加赏，明重元功，无使百僚元元失望。”

太后乃下诏曰：“大司马新都侯莽三世为三公，典周公之职，建万世策，功德为忠臣宗，化流海内，远人慕义，越裳氏重译献白雉。

其以召陵、新息二县户二万八千益封莽，复其后嗣，畴其爵邑，封功如萧相国。

以故萧相国甲第为安汉公第，定著于令，传之无穷。”

于是莽为惶恐，不得已而起受策。

策曰：“汉危无嗣，公定国策，四辅之职，三公之任，而公干之；

群僚众位，公卿大夫，咸取正焉。

功德茂著，宗庙以安，盖白雉之瑞，周成象焉。

故赐嘉号曰安汉公，辅翼于帝，期于致平，毋违朕意。”

莽受太傅安汉公号，让还益封畴爵邑事，云愿须百姓家给，然后加赏。

群公复争，太后诏曰：“公自期百姓家给，是以听之。

其令公奉、舍人赏赐皆倍故。

百姓家给人足，大司徒、大司空以闻。”

莽复让不受，而建言宜立诸侯王后及高祖以来功臣子孙，大者封侯，或赐爵关内侯食邑，然后及诸在位，各有第序。

上尊宗庙，增加礼乐，下惠士民鳏寡，恩泽之政无所不施。

语在《平纪》。

莽既说众庶，又欲专断，知太后厌政，乃风公卿奏言：“往者，吏以功次迁至二千石，及州部所举茂材异等吏，率多不称，宜皆见安汉公。

又太后不宜亲省小事。”

令太后下诏曰：“皇帝幼年，朕且统政，比加元服。

今众事烦碎，朕春秋高，精气不堪，殆非所以安躬体而育养皇帝者也。

故选用忠贤，立四辅，群下劝职，永以康宁。

孔子曰：‘巍巍乎，舜禹之有天下而不与焉！’

自今以来，惟封爵乃以闻，他事，安汉公、四辅平决。

州牧、二千石及茂材吏初除奏事者，辄引入至近署对安汉公，考故官，问新职，以知其称否。”

于是莽人人延问，致密恩意，厚加赠送，其不合指，显奏免之，权与人主侔矣。

莽欲以虚名说太后，白言“亲承前孝哀丁、傅奢侈之后，百姓未赡者多，太后宜且衣缯练，颇损膳，以视天下。”

莽因上书，愿出钱百万，献田三十顷，付大司农助给贫民。

于是公卿皆慕效焉。

莽帅群臣上奏曰：“陛下春秋尊，久衣重练，减御膳，诚非所以辅精气，育皇帝，安宗庙也。

臣莽数叩头省户下，白争未见许。

今幸赖陛下德泽，间者风雨时，甘露降，神芝生，蓂荚、朱草、嘉禾、休征同时并至。

臣莽等不胜大愿，愿陛下爱精休神，阔略思虑，遵帝王之常服，复太官之法膳，使臣子各得尽欢心，备共养。

惟哀省察！”

莽又令太后下诏曰：“盖闻母后之义，思不出乎门阈。

国不蒙佑，皇帝年在襁褓，未任亲政，战战兢兢，惧于宗庙之不安。

国家之大纲，微朕孰当统之？

是以孔子见南子，周公居摄，盖权时也。

勤身极思，忧劳未绥，故国奢则视之以俭，矫枉者过其正，而朕不身帅，将谓天下何！

夙夜梦想，五谷丰熟，百姓家给，比皇帝加元服，委政而授焉。

今诚未皇于轻靡而备味，庶几与百僚有成，其勖之哉！”

每有水旱，莽辄素食，左右以白。

太后遣使者诏莽曰：“闻公菜食，忧民深矣。

今秋幸熟，公勤于职，以时食肉，爱身为国。”

莽念中国已平，唯四夷未有异，乃遣使者赍黄金、币、帛，重赂匈奴单于，使上书言：“闻中国讥二名，故名囊知牙斯今更名知，慕从圣制。”

又遣王昭君女须卜居次入待。

所以诳耀媚事太后，下至旁侧长御，方故万端。

莽既尊重，欲以女配帝为皇后，以固其权，奏言：“皇帝即位三年，长秋宫未建，液廷媵未充。

乃者，国家之难，本从亡嗣，配取不正。

请考论《五经》，定取礼，正十二女之义，以广继嗣。

博采二王后及周公、孔子世列侯在长安者適子女。

事下有司，上众女名，王氏女多在选中者。

莽恐其与己女争，即上言：“身亡德，子材下，不宜与众女并采。”

太后以为至诚，乃下诏曰：“王氏女，朕之外家，其勿采。”

庶民、诸生、郎吏以上守阙上书者日千余人，公卿大夫或诣廷中，或伏省户下，咸言：

“明诏圣德巍巍如彼，安汉公盛勋堂堂若此，今当立后，独奈何废公女？天下安所归命！愿得公女为天下母。”

莽遣长安以下分部晓止公卿及诸生，而上书者愈甚。

太后不得已，听公卿采莽女。

莽复自白：“宜博选众女。”

公卿争曰：“不宜采诸女以贰正统。”

莽白：“愿见女。”

太后遣长乐少府、宗正、尚书令纳采见女，还奏言：

“公女渐渍德化，有窈窕之容，宜承天序，奉祭祀。”

有诏遣大司徒、大司空策告宗庙，杂加卜筮，皆曰：

“兆遇金水王相，封遇父母得位，所谓‘康强’之占，‘逢吉’之符也。”

信乡侯佟上言：“《春秋》，天子将娶于纪，则褒纪子称侯，安汉公国未称古制。

事下有司，皆曰：“古者天子封后父百里，尊而不臣，以重宗庙，孝之至也。

佟言应礼，可许。请以新野田二万五千六百顷益封莽，满百里。”

莽谢曰：“臣莽子女诚不足以配至尊，复听众议，益封臣莽。

伏自惟念，得托肺腑，获爵士，如使子女诚能奉称圣德，臣莽国邑足以共朝贡，不须复加益地之宠。

愿归所益。”太后许之。

有司奏：“故事，聘皇后黄金二万斤，为钱二万万。”

莽深辞让，受四千万，而以其三千三百万予十一媵家。

群臣复言：“今皇后受骋，逾群妾亡几。”

有诏，复益二千三百万，合为三千万。

莽复以其千万分予九族贫者。

陈崇时为大司徒司直，与张敞孙竦相善。

竦者博通士，为崇草奏，称莽功德，崇奏之，曰：

窃见安汉公自初束脩，值世俗隆奢丽之时，蒙两宫厚骨肉之宠，被诸父赫赫之光，财饶势足，亡所牾意，

然而折节行仁，克心履礼，拂世矫俗，确然特立；

恶衣恶食，陋车驽马，妃匹无二，闺门之内，孝友之德，众莫不闻；

清静乐道，温良下士，惠于故旧，笃于师友。

孔子曰：“未若贫而乐，富而好礼”，公之谓矣。

及为侍中，故定陵侯淳于长有大逆罪，公不敢私，建白诛讨。

周公诛管、蔡，季子鸩叔牙，公之谓矣。

是以孝成皇帝命公大司马，委以国统。

孝哀皇帝即位，骄妾窥欲，奸臣萌动，公手劾高昌侯董宏，改正故定陶共王母之僣坐。

自是之后，朝臣论议，靡不据经。

以病辞位，归于第家，为贼臣所陷。

就国之后，孝哀皇帝觉寤，复还公长安，临病加剧，犹不忘公，复特进位。

是夜仓卒，国无储主，奸臣充朝，危殆甚矣。

朕惟定国之计莫宜于公，引纳于朝，即日罢退高安侯董贤，转漏之间，忠策辄建，纲纪咸张。

绶和、元寿，再遭大行，万事皆举，祸乱不作。

辅朕五年，人伦之本正，天地之位定。

钦承神祇，经纬四时，复千载之废，矫百世之失，天下和会，大众方辑。

《诗》之灵台，《书》之作雒，镐京之制，商邑之度，于今复兴。

昭章先帝之元功，明著祖宗之令德，推显严父配天之义，修立郊禘宗祀之礼，以光大孝。

是以四海雍雍，万国慕义，蛮夷殊俗，不召自至，渐化端冕，奉珍助祭。

寻旧本道，遵术重古，动而有成，事得厥中。

至德要道，通于神明，祖考嘉享。

光耀显章，天符仍臻，元气大同。

麟凤龟龙，众祥之瑞，七百有余。

遂制礼作乐，有绥靖宗庙社稷之大勋。

普天之下，惟公是赖，官在宰衡，位为上公。

今加九命之锡，其以助祭，共文武之职，乃遂及厥祖。

於戏，岂不休哉！

于是莽稽首再拜，受绿韨衮冕衣赏，玚琫玚珌，句履，鸾路乘马，龙旂九旒，皮弁素积，戎路乘马，彤弓矢，卢弓矢，左建朱钺，右建金戚，甲胄一具，秬鬯二卣，圭瓒二，九命青玉珪二，朱户纳陛。

署宗官、祝官、卜官、史官，虎贲三百人，家令丞各一人，宗、祝、卜、史官皆置啬夫，佐官汉公。

在中府外第，虎贲为门卫，当出入者傅籍。

自四辅、三公有事府第，皆用传。

以楚王邸为安汉公第，大缮治，通周卫。

祖祢庙及寝皆为朱户纳陛。

陈崇又奏：“安汉公祠祖祢，出城门，城门校尉宜将骑士从。

入有门卫，出有骑士，所以重国也。”奏可。

其秋，莽以皇后有子孙瑞，通子午道。

子午道从杜陵直绝南山，径汉中。

风俗使者八人还，言天下风俗齐同，诈为郡国造歌谣，颂功德，凡三万言。

莽奏定著令。

又奏为市无二贾，官无狱讼，邑无盗贼，野无饥民，道不拾遗，男女异路之制，犯者象刑。

刘歆、陈崇等十二人皆以治明堂，宣教化，封为列侯。

莽既致太平，北化匈奴，东致海外，南怀黄支，唯西方未有加。

乃遣中郎将平宪等多持金币诱塞外羌，使献地，愿内属。

宪等奏言：“羌豪良愿等种，人口可万二千人，愿为内臣，献鲜水海、允谷盐池，平地美草皆予汉民，自居险阻处为藩蔽。

问良愿降意，对曰：‘太皇太后圣明，安汉公至仁，天下太平，五谷成熟，或禾长丈余，或一粟三米，或不种自生，或茧不蚕自成，甘露从天下，醴泉自地出，“ male and female phoenixes have come and arrived,” supernatural birds have descended and perched, so that for the [last] four years the Ch'iang people have had nothing to suffer [from the government]. Hence “oh! how pleasant” to be admitted [to the Chinese empire] and to become your subordinates.’

宜以时处业，置属国领护。”

事下莽，莽复奏曰：“太后秉统数年，恩泽洋溢，和气四塞，绝域殊俗，靡不慕义。

越裳氏重译献白雉，黄支自三万里贡生犀，东夷王度大海奉国珍，匈奴单于顺制作，去二名，今西域良愿等复举地为臣妾，昔唐尧横被四表，亦亡以加之。

今谨案已有东海、南海、北海郡，未有西海郡，请受良愿等所献地为西海郡。

臣又闻圣王序天文，定地理，因山川民俗以制州界。

汉家地广二帝、三王，凡十三州，州名及界多不应经。

《尧典》十有二州，后定为九州。

汉家廓地辽远，州牧行部，远者三万余里，不可为九。

谨以经义正十二州名分界，以应正始。”奏可。

又增法五十条，犯者徙之西海。

徙者以千万数，民始怨矣。

泉陵侯刘庆上书言：“周成王幼少，称孺子，周公居摄。

今帝富于春秋，宜令安汉公行天子事，如周公。”郡臣皆曰：“宜如庆言。”

冬，荧惑入月中。

平帝疾，莽作策，请命于泰畤，戴璧秉圭，愿以身代。

藏策金滕，置于前殿，敕诸公勿敢言。

十二月，平帝崩，大赦天下。

莽征明礼者宗伯凤等与定天下吏六百石以上皆服丧三年。

奏尊孝成庙曰统宗，孝平庙曰元宗。

时元帝世绝，而宣帝曾孙有见王五人，列侯广戚侯显等四十八人，莽恶其长大，曰：“兄弟不得相为后。

乃选玄孙中最幼广戚侯子婴，年二岁，托以为卜相最吉。

是月，前辉光谢嚣奏武功长孟通浚井得白石，上圆下方，有丹书著石，文曰：“告安汉公莽为皇帝。”

符命之起，自此始矣。

莽命群公以白太后，太后曰：“此诬罔天下，不可施行！”

太保舜谓太后：“事已如此，无可奈何，沮之力不能止。又莽非敢有它，但欲称摄以重其权，填服天下耳。”

太后听许。

舜等即共令太后下诏曰：“盖闻天生众民，不能相治，为之立君以统理之。

君年幼稚，必有寄托而居摄焉，然后能奉天施而成地化，群生茂育。

《书》不云乎？‘天工，人其代之。’

朕以孝平皇帝幼年，且统国政，几加元服，委政而属之。

今短命而崩，呜呼哀哉！

已使有司征孝宣皇帝玄孙二十三人，差度宜者，以嗣孝平皇帝之后。

玄孙年在襁褓，不得至德君子，孰能安之？

安汉公莽辅政三世，比遭际会，安光汉室，遂同殊风，至于制作，与周公异世同符。

今前辉光嚣、武功长通上言丹石之符，朕深思厥意，云‘为皇帝’者，乃摄行皇帝之事也。

夫有法成易，非圣人者亡法。

其令安汉公居摄践祚，如周公故事，以武功县为安汉公采地，名曰汉光邑。

具礼仪奏。”

于是群臣奏言：“太后圣德昭然，深见天意，诏令安汉公居摄。

臣闻周成王幼少，周道未成，成王不能共事天地，修文、武之烈。

周公权而居摄，则周道成，王室安；不居摄，则恐周队失天命。

《书》曰：‘我嗣事子孙，大不克共上下，遏失前人光，在家不知命不易。天应棐谌，乃亡队命。’

说曰：周公服天子之冕，南面而朝群臣，发号施令，常称王命。

召公贤人，不知圣人之意，故不说也。

《礼·明堂记》曰‘周公朝诸侯于明堂，天子负斧依南面而立。’

谓‘周公践天子位，六年朝诸侯，制礼作乐，而天下大服’也。

召公不说。时武王崩，■粗未除。

由是言之，周公始摄则居天了之位，非乃六年而践阼也。

《书》逸《嘉禾篇》曰：‘周公奉鬯立于阼阶，延登，赞曰：假王莅政，勤和天下。’

此周公摄政，赞者所称。

成王加元服，周公则致政。

《书》曰：‘朕复子明辟’，周公常称王命，专行不报，故言我复子明君也。

臣请安汉公居摄践祚，服天子韨冕，背斧依于户牖之间，南面朝群臣，听政事。

车服出入警跸，民臣称臣妾，皆如天子之制。

郊祀天地，宗祀明堂，共祀宗庙，享祭群神，赞曰‘假皇帝’，民臣谓之‘摄皇帝’，自称曰‘予’。

平决朝事，常以皇帝之诏称‘制’、以奉顺皇天之心，辅翼汉室，保安孝平皇帝之幼嗣，遂寄托之义，隆治平之化。

其朝见太皇太后、帝皇后，皆复臣节。

自施政教于其宫家国采，如诸侯礼仪故事。

臣昧死请。”太后诏曰：“可。”

明年，改元曰“居摄”。

居摄元年正月，莽祀上帝于南郊，迎春于东郊，行大射礼于明堂，养三老五更，成礼而去。

置柱下五史，秩如御史，听政事，侍旁记疏言行。

三月己丑，立宣帝玄孙婴为皇太子，号曰孺子。

以王舜为太傅左辅，甄丰为太阿右拂，甄邯为太保后承。

又置四少，秩皆二千石。

四月，安众侯刘崇与相张绍谋曰：“安汉公莽专制朝政，必危刘氏。

天下非之者，乃莫敢先举，此宗室耻也。

吾帅宗族为先，海内必和。”

绍等从者百余人，遂进攻宛，不得入而败。

绍者，张竦之从兄也。

竦与崇族父刘嘉诣阙自归，莽赦弗罪。

竦因为嘉作奏曰：

建平、元寿之间，大统几绝，宗室几弃。

赖蒙陛下圣德，扶服振救，遮扞匡卫，国命复延，宗室明目。

临明统政，发号施令，动以宗室为始，登用九族为先。

并录支亲，建立王侯，南面之孤，计以百数。

收复绝属，存亡续废，得比肩首，复为人者，嫔然成行，所以藩汉国，辅汉宗也。

建辟雍，立明堂，班天法，流圣化，朝群后，昭文德，宗室诸侯，咸益土地。

天下喁喁，引领而叹，颂声洋洋，满耳而入。

国家所以服此美，膺此名，飨此福，受此荣者，岂非太皇太后日昃之思，陛下夕惕之念哉！

何谓？乱则统其理，危则致其安，祸则引其福，绝则继其统，幼则代其任，晨夜屑屑，寒暑勤勤，无时休息，孳孳不已者，凡以为天，厚刘氏也。

臣无愚智，民无男女，皆谕至意。

而安众侯崇乃独怀悖惑之心，操畔逆之虑，兴兵动众，欲危宗庙，恶不忍闻，罪不容诛，诚臣子之仇，宗室之雠，国家之贼，天下之害也。

是故亲属震落而告其罪，民人溃畔而弃其兵，进不跬步，退伏其殃。

百岁之母，孩提之子，同时断斩，悬头竿杪，珠珥在耳，首饰犹存，为计若此，岂不悖哉！

臣闻古者畔逆之国，既以诛讨，则猪其宫室以为污池，纳垢浊焉，名曰凶虚，虽生菜茹，而人不食。

四墙其社，覆上栈下，示不得通。

辨社诸侯，出门见之，著以为戒。

方今天下闻崇之反也，咸欲骞衣手剑而叱之。

其先至者，则拂其颈，冲其匈，刃其躯，切其肌；

后至者，欲拔其门，仆其墙，夷其屋，焚其器，应声涤地，则时成创。

而宗室尤甚，言必切齿焉。

何则？以其背畔恩义，而不知重德之所在也。

宗室所居或远，嘉幸得先闻，不胜愤愤之愿，愿为宗室倡始，父子兄弟负笼荷锸，驰之南阳，猪崇宫室，令如古制。

及崇社宜如毫社，以赐诸侯，用永监戒。

愿下四辅公卿大夫议，以明好恶，视四方。

于是莽大说。

公卿曰：“皆宜如嘉言。”

莽白太后下诏曰：“惟嘉父子兄弟，虽与崇有属，不敢阿私，或见萌牙，相率告之，及其祸成，同共雠之，应合古制，忠孝著焉。

其以杜衍户千封嘉为师礼侯，嘉子七人皆赐爵关内侯。”

后又封竦为淑德侯。

长安为之语曰：“欲求封，过张伯松；力战斗，不如巧为奏。”

莽又封南阳吏民有功者百余人，污池刘崇室宅。

后谋反者，皆污池云。

群臣复白：“刘崇等谋逆者，以莽权轻也。

宜尊重以填海内。”

五月甲辰，太后诏莽朝见太后称“假皇帝。”

冬十月丙辰朔，日有食之。

十二月，群臣奏请：“益安汉公宫及家吏，置率更令，庙、厩、厨长丞，中庶子，虎贲以下百余人，又置卫士三百人。

安汉公庐为摄省，府为摄殿，第为摄宫。”奏可。

莽白太后下诏曰：“故太师光虽前薨，功效已列。

太保舜、大司空丰、轻车将军邯、步兵将军建皆为诱进单于筹策，又典灵台、明堂、辟雍、四郊，定制度，开子午道，与宰衡同心说德，合意并力，功德茂著。

封舜了匡为同心侯，林为说德侯，光孙寿为合意侯，丰孙匡为并力侯。

益邯、建各三千户。”

是岁，西羌庞恬、傅幡等怨莽夺其地作西海郡，反攻西海太守程永，永奔走。

莽诛永，遣护羌校尉窦况击之。

二年春，窦况等击破西羌。

五月，更造货：错刀，一直五千；契刀，一直五百；大钱，一直五十，与五铢钱并行。

民多盗铸者。

禁列侯以下不得挟黄金，输御府受直，然卒不与直。

九月，东郡太守翟义都试，勒车骑，因发奔命，立严乡侯刘信为天子，移檄郡国，言“莽毒杀平帝，摄天子位，欲绝汉室，今共行天罚诛莽”。

郡国疑惑，众十余万。

莽惶惧不能食，昼夜抱孺子告祷郊庙，放《大诰》作策，遣谏大夫桓谭等班于天下，谕以摄位当反政孺子之意。

遣王邑、孙建等八将军击义，分屯诸关，守厄塞。

槐里男子赵明、霍鸿等起兵，以和翟义，相与谋曰：“诸将精兵悉东，京师空，可攻长安。”

众稍多，至且十万人，莽恐，遣将军王奇、王级将兵拒之。

以太保甄邯为大将军，受钺高庙，领天下兵，左杖节，右把钺，屯城外。

王舜、甄丰昼夜循行殿中。

十二月，王邑等破翟义于圉。

司威陈崇使监军上书言：“陛下奉天洪范，心合宝龟，膺受元命，豫知成败，咸应兆占，是谓配天。

配天之主，虑则移气，言则动物，施则成化。

臣崇伏读诏书下日，窃计其时，圣思始发，而反虏仍破；诏文始书，反虏大败；制书始下，反虏毕斩，众将未及齐其锋芒，臣崇未及尽共愚虑，而事已决矣。”

莽大说。

三年春，地震。大赦天下。

王邑等还京师，西与王级等合击明、鸿，皆破灭，语在《翟义传》。

莽大置酒未央宫白虎殿，劳赐将帅，诏陈崇治校军功，第其高下。

莽乃上奏曰：“明圣之世，国多贤人，故唐、虞之时，可比屋而封，至功成事就，则加赏焉。

至于夏后涂山之会，执玉帛者万国，诸侯执玉，附庸执帛。

周武王孟津之上，尚有八百诸侯。

周公居摄，郊祀后稷以配天，宗祀文王于明堂以配上帝，是以四海之内各以其职来祭，盖诸侯千八百矣。

《礼记·王制》千七百余国，是以孔子著《孝经》曰：‘不敢遗小国之臣，而况于公、侯、伯、子、男乎？故得万国之欢心以事其先王。’此天子之孝也。

秦为亡道，残灭诸侯以为郡县，欲擅天下之利，故二世而亡。

高皇帝受命除残，考功施赏，建国数百，后稍衰微，其余仅存。

太皇太后躬统大纲，广封功德以劝善，兴灭继绝以永世，是以大化流通，旦暮且成。

遭羌寇害西海郡，反虏流言东郡，逆贼惑众西土，忠臣孝子莫不奋怒，所征殄灭，尽备厥辜，天下咸宁。

今制礼作乐，实考周爵五等，地四等，有明文；殷爵三等，有其说，无其文。

孔子曰：‘周监于二代，郁郁乎文哉！吾从周。’

臣请诸将帅当受爵邑者爵五等，地四等。”奏可。

于是封者高为侯、伯，次为子、男，当赐爵关内侯者更名曰附城，凡数百人。

击西海者以“羌”为号，槐里以“武”为号，翟义以“虏”为号。

群臣复奏言：“太后修功录德，远者千载，近者当世，或以文封，或以武爵，深浅大小，靡不毕举。

今摄皇帝背依践祚，宜异于宰国之时，制作虽未毕已，宜进二子爵皆为公。

《春秋》‘善善及子孙’，‘贤者之后，宜有土地’。

成王广封周公庶子六人，皆有茅土。

及汉家名相大将萧、霍之属，咸及支庶。

兄子光，可先封为列侯；诸孙，制度毕已，大司徒、大司空上名，如前诏书。”

太后诏曰：“进摄皇帝子褒新侯安为新举公，赏都侯临为褒新公，封光为衍功侯。”

是时，莽还归新都国，群臣复白以封莽孙宗为新都侯。

莽既灭翟义，自谓威德日盛，获天人助，遂谋即真之事矣。

九月，莽母功显君死，意不在哀，令太后诏议其服。

少阿、羲和刘歆与博士诸儒七十八人皆曰：“居摄之义，所以统立天功，兴崇帝道，成就法度，安辑海内也。

昔殷成汤既没，而太子蚤夭，其子太甲幼少不明，伊尹放诸桐宫而居摄，以兴殷道。

周武王既没，周道未成，成王幼少，周公屏成王而居摄，以成周道。

是以殷有翼翼之化，周有刑错之功。

今太皇太后比遭家之不造，委任安汉公宰尹群僚，衡平天下。

遭孺子幼少，未能共上下，皇天降瑞，出丹石之符，是以太皇太后则天明命，诏安汉公居摄践祚，将以成圣汉之业，与唐、虞三代比隆也。

摄皇帝遂开秘府，会群儒，制礼作乐，卒定庶官，茂成天功。

圣心周悉，卓尔独见，发得周礼，以明因监，则天稽古，而损益焉，犹仲尼之闻《韶》，日月之不可阶，非圣哲之至，孰能若兹！

纲幻咸张，成在一匮，此其所以保佑圣汉，安靖元元之效也。

今功显君薨，《礼》：‘庶子为后，为其母緦。’

传曰：‘与尊者为体，不敢服其私亲也。

摄皇帝以圣德承皇天之命，受太后之诏居摄践祚，奉汉大宗之后，上有天地社稷之重，下有元元万机之忧，不得顾其私亲。

故太皇太后建厥元孙，俾侯新都，为哀侯后。

明摄皇帝与尊者为体，承宗庙之祭，奉共养太皇太后，不得服其私亲也。

《周礼》曰‘王为诸侯緦縗’，‘弁而加环绖’，同姓则麻，异姓则葛。

摄皇帝当为功显君緦縗，弁而加麻环绖，如天子吊诸侯服，以应圣制。’

莽遂行焉，凡一吊再会，而令新都侯宗为主，服丧三年云。

司威陈崇奏，衍功侯光私报执金吾窦况，令杀人，况为收系，致其法。

莽大怒，切责光。

光母曰：“女自视孰与长孙、中孙？”

遂母子自杀，及况皆死。

初，莽以事母、养嫂、抚兄子为名，及后悖虐，复以示公义焉。

令光子嘉嗣爵为侯。

莽下书曰：“遏密之义，讫于季冬，正月郊祀，八音当奏。

王公卿士，乐凡几等？五声八音，条各云何？

其与所部儒生各尽精思，悉陈其义。”

是岁，广饶侯刘京，车骑将军千人扈云、太保属臧鸿奏符命。

京言齐郡新井，云言巴郡石牛，鸿言扶风雍石，莽皆迎受。

十一月甲子，莽上奏太后曰：

陛下至圣，遭家不造，遇汉十二世三七之厄，承天威命，诏臣莽居摄，受孺子之托，任天下之寄。

臣莽兢兢业业，惧于不称。

宗室广饶侯刘京上书言：“七月中，齐郡临淄县昌兴亭长辛当一暮数梦，曰：‘吾，天公使也。天公使我告亭长曰：“摄皇帝当为真。即不信我，此亭中当有新井。’亭长晨起视亭中，诚有新井，入地且百尺。”

十一月壬子，直建冬至，巴郡石牛，戊午，雍石文，皆到于未央宫之前殿。

臣与太保安阳侯舜等视，天风起，尘冥，风止，得铜符帛图于右前，文曰：天告帝符，献者封侯。承天命，用神令。”

骑都尉崔发等视说。

及前孝哀皇帝建平二年六月甲子下诏书，更为太初元将元年，案其本事，甘忠可、夏贺良谶书臧兰台。

臣莽以为元将元年者，大将居摄改元之文也。于今信矣。

《尚书·康诰》“王若曰：‘孟侯，朕其弟，小子封。’”此周公居摄称王之文也。

《春秋》隐公不言即位，摄也。

此二经周公、孔子所定，盖为后法。

孔子曰：“畏天命，畏大人，畏圣人之言。”

臣莽敢不承用！

臣请共事神祇宗庙，奏言太皇太后、孝平皇后，皆称假皇帝。

其号令天下，天下奏言事，毋言“摄”。

以居摄三年为初始元年，漏刻以百二十为度，用应天命。

臣莽夙夜养育隆就孺子，令与周之成王比德，宣明太皇太后威德于万方，期于富而教之。

孺子加元服，复子明辟，如周公故事。

奏可。

众庶知其奉符命，指意群臣博议别奏，以视即真之渐矣。

期门郎张充等六人谋共劫莽，立楚王。发觉，诛死。

梓潼人哀章，学问长安，素无行，好为大言。

见莽居摄，即作铜匮，为两检，置其一曰“天帝行玺金匮图’，其一署曰“赤帝行玺某传予黄帝金策书”。

某者，高皇帝名也。

书言王莽为真天子，皇太后如天命。

图书皆书莽大臣八兴，又取令名王兴、王盛，章因自窜姓名，凡为十一人，皆署官爵，为辅佐。

章闻齐井、石牛事下，即日皆时，衣黄衣，持匮至高庙，以付仆射。

仆射以闻。

戊辰，莽至高庙拜受金匮神嬗。

御王冠，谒太后，还坐未央宫前殿，下书曰：

予以不德，托于皇初祖考黄帝之后，皇始祖考虞帝之苗裔，而太皇太后之末属。

皇天上帝隆显大佑，成命统序，符契图文，金匮策书，神明诏告，属予以天下兆民。

赤帝汉氏高皇帝之灵，承天命，传国金策之书，予甚祇畏，敢不钦受！

以戊辰直定，御王冠，即真天子位，定有天下之号曰‘新’。

其改正朔，易服色，变牺牲，殊徽帜，异器制。

以十二月朔癸酉为建国元年正月之朔，以鸡鸣为时。

服色配德上黄，牺牲应正用白，使节之旄幡皆纯黄，其署曰‘新使王威节’，以承皇天上帝威命也。</div>

          <h3>现代汉语</h3>
          <div class="txt">王莽，字巨君，是汉元帝皇后王政君异母弟弟王曼的儿子。

他的继父（此处指外祖父王禁，因王莽父早逝，随母在外祖父家生活）和兄弟们都在元帝、成帝时期被封侯，身居高位辅佐朝政，家族中共有九位列侯、五位大司马，这些事记载在《元后传》中。

唯独王莽的父亲王曼早逝，没有被封侯。

王莽的堂兄弟们都是将军、五侯的儿子，趁着时势奢侈浪费，以车马、歌妓、女色、游乐来互相攀比炫耀。

唯独王莽孤独贫寒，因此降低自己的身份，做事恭谨俭朴。

他学习《礼经》，以沛郡人陈参为老师，勤奋修身，广泛学习，穿着打扮如同儒生。

他侍奉母亲和寡嫂，抚养兄长的遗孤，行为十分端正完备。

又在外面结交贤才，在家族中侍奉各位伯父叔父，待人委婉周到，很有礼貌。

阳朔年间，伯父大将军王凤生病，王莽侍奉疾病，亲自尝药，头发散乱，面容肮脏，连月不解衣带休息。

王凤将要去世时，把他托付给王太后和成帝，王莽被任命为黄门郎，升任射声校尉。

过了很久，叔父成都侯王商上书，愿意分出自己的封户和食邑来封给王莽，加上长乐少府戴崇、侍中金涉、胡骑校尉箕闳、上谷都尉阳并、中郎陈汤，都是当时的知名人士，都为王莽说话，皇上因此认为王莽贤能。

永始元年，封王莽为新都侯，封国在南阳郡新野县的都乡，有一千五百户。

升任骑都尉、光禄大夫、侍中，在宫中值宿警卫谨慎恭敬，爵位越尊贵，品行越谦逊。

散发车马衣物，救济施舍宾客，家中没有多余的财物。

收养赡养知名人士，结交的将相卿大夫很多。

所以在位的官员轮番推荐他，游说的人替他宣扬，虚假的声誉隆盛融洽，超过了他的各位叔父。

敢于做出能激发舆论的行为，做了也不感到惭愧。

王莽的哥哥王永担任诸曹，早逝，有儿子王光，王莽让他在博士门下学习。

王莽休假外出，整顿车马，带着羊和酒，慰劳赠送王光的老师，恩惠施及王光的所有同学。

王光的年龄比王莽的儿子王宇小，王莽让他们在同一天娶媳妇，宾客满座。

一会儿，有人说太夫人（王莽的母亲）苦于某种病痛，应当喝某种药，直到宾客散去，王莽多次起身去探视。

王莽曾私下买了个侍婢，兄弟们中有人略有所闻，王莽便说：“后将军朱子元没有儿子，我听说这个女子适宜生育，便为他买了下来。”当天就把侍婢送给了朱子元。

他隐藏自己的真实意图、追求名声到了这种地步。

这时，太后姐姐的儿子淳于长因有才能位列九卿，地位先于王莽，在王莽之上。

王莽暗中搜集他的罪过，通过大司马曲阳侯王根上报，淳于长被处死，王莽因此获得忠诚正直的名声，这件事记载在《淳于长传》中。

王根趁机请求退休，推荐王莽代替自己，皇上于是提拔王莽为大司马。

这一年是绥和元年，王莽三十八岁。

王莽既然超出同列，继四位伯父叔父之后辅佐朝政，想让自己的名声超过前人，便克制自己，不知疲倦，聘请各位贤良之士担任属官，把赏赐的封邑和钱财都用来供养士人，自己更加俭朴。

母亲生病，公卿列侯派夫人前来问候病情，王莽的妻子出来迎接，衣服长度不拖到地上，系着布制的蔽膝。

见到她的人以为是奴仆，询问后才知道是王莽的夫人，都很惊讶。

辅佐朝政一年多，成帝去世，哀帝即位，尊奉皇太后为太皇太后。

太皇太后诏令王莽回到自己的府第，回避哀帝的外戚。

王莽上奏疏请求退休，哀帝派尚书令诏令王莽说：“先帝把朝政托付给您，您因劳累而面容憔悴，亲自侍奉先帝的丧葬事宜，始终没有丝毫过失，如今您称病请求退职，我非常伤感。

已经诏令尚书等候您上奏政事。”

又派丞相孔光、大司空何武、左将军师丹、卫尉傅喜禀告太后说：“皇帝听到太后的诏令，非常悲伤。

如果大司马不出来任职，皇帝就不敢处理朝政。”

太后又命令王莽处理政事。

当时哀帝的祖母定陶傅太后、母亲丁姬都在世，高昌侯董宏上书说：“按照《春秋》的义理，母亲凭借儿子而尊贵，丁姬应当加上尊号。”

王莽和师丹一起弹劾董宏误导朝廷，大逆不道，这件事记载在《师丹传》中。

后来有一天，未央宫设置酒宴，内者令为傅太后张设帐幕，让她坐在太皇太后座位旁边。

王莽巡视时，斥责内者令说：“定陶太后是诸侯的姬妾，怎么能和最尊贵的太皇太后并列！”于是撤去帐幕，重新设置座位。

傅太后听说后，非常愤怒，不肯参加宴会，对王莽深怀怨恨。

王莽又请求退休，哀帝赏赐王莽五百斤黄金，一辆安车和四匹马，让他辞官回家。

公卿大夫大多称赞他，皇上于是加以恩宠，设置专使到他家中，让中黄门每十天赏赐一次饮食。

下诏说：“新都侯王莽为国家忧虑操劳，坚守正义，我差不多能和他一起实现天下大治。

太皇太后诏令王莽回家，我非常怜悯他。

现把黄邮聚的三百五十户加封给王莽，赐位特进，给予事中的官职，每月初一、十五朝见，拜见时的礼仪如同三公。

皇上出行时，他可以乘坐绿车随从。”

过了两年，傅太后、丁姬都被加上尊号，丞相朱博上奏说：“王莽先前不弘扬尊崇尊长的大义，压制贬低尊号，损害孝道，应当被公开处死。

幸亏得到赦免的命令，但不应当拥有爵位和封地，请求将他免为平民。”

皇上说：“因为王莽和太皇太后有亲属关系，不要免去他的爵位，遣送他回封国。”

王莽闭门自守，他的中子王获杀死了奴隶，王莽严厉斥责王获，让他自杀。

在封国三年，官吏上书为王莽申诉冤情的有上百人。

元寿元年，发生日食，贤良周护、宋崇等人在对策中极力称颂王莽的功德，皇上于是征召王莽。

当初王莽回到封国时，南阳太守因为王莽身份尊贵重要，选拔门下掾宛县人孔休担任新都国相。

孔休拜见王莽，王莽极尽礼节主动结交，孔休也听说过他的名声，予以回应。

后来王莽生病，孔休前去问候，王莽趁着情谊，送上镶有玉饰的宝剑，想与他交好。

孔休不肯接受，王莽于是说：“我确实看到您脸上有疤痕，美玉可以消除疤痕，我想献上剑上的玉饰罢了。”

随即解下剑上的玉饰，孔休又一次推辞。

王莽说：“您是嫌它贵重吗？”于是捶碎了玉饰，亲自包起来送给孔休，孔休才接受了。

等到王莽被征召离开封国时，想再见孔休，孔休称病不见。

王莽回到京城一年多，哀帝去世，没有儿子，而且傅太后、丁太后都已去世，太皇太后当天驾车前往未央宫收取玺印绶带，派使者疾驰去召王莽。

诏令尚书，所有调动军队的符节、百官上奏的事务、中黄门、期门兵都归王莽掌管。

王莽禀告太后，让孝哀皇后迁居北宫，收捕傅氏、丁氏的亲属，全部免除他们的官爵，迁徙到远方。

王莽因为大司徒孔光是著名的儒者，曾辅佐三位君主，受到太后的敬重，天下人都信任他，于是极力尊敬侍奉孔光，推荐孔光的女婿甄邯担任侍中奉车都尉。

对于那些哀帝的外戚以及在位大臣中平时不喜欢的人，王莽都罗织他们的罪名，写成弹劾的奏书草稿，让甄邯拿给孔光。

孔光一向胆小谨慎，不敢不上奏，王莽禀告太后，总是批准这些奏书。

于是前将军何武、后将军公孙禄因互相推举而获罪，被免职。

丁氏、傅氏以及董贤的亲属都被免除官爵，迁徙到远方。

红阳侯王立，是太后的亲弟弟，虽然不在官位，王莽因为他是叔父，内心敬畏他，担心王立从容地对太后进言，使自己不能肆意行事，于是又让孔光上奏王立过去的罪过：

“以前知道定陵侯淳于长犯了大逆不道之罪，却接受他很多贿赂，为他说话，误导朝廷；

后来又说官婢杨寄的私生子是皇子，众人都说这是吕氏、少帝的情况再次出现，纷纷被天下人怀疑，难以昭示后代，成就幼年君主的功业。

请求打发王立前往封国。”

太后不肯听从，王莽说：“如今汉家衰落，接连几代没有子嗣，太后独自代替幼主治理国政，实在令人畏惧，尽力做到公正为天下人做表率，还恐怕有人不顺从，现在因为私人恩情违背大臣的建议，这样一来，群臣会倾向奸邪，祸乱就会从此产生！

应该暂且打发他前往封国，待局势安定后再征召他回来。”

太后没有办法，打发王立前往封国。

王莽用来胁迫控制上下的手段，都是这类做法。

于是依附顺从他的人得到提拔，违逆怨恨他的人遭到诛杀。

王舜、王邑是他的心腹，甄丰、甄邯负责决断，平晏掌管机密事务，刘歆主管典章制度，孙建是他的得力助手。

甄丰的儿子甄寻、刘歆的儿子刘棻、涿郡人崔发、南阳人陈崇都因有才能而得到王莽的宠幸。

王莽外表严厉而言辞方正，想要做什么事情，只略微露出一点迹象，党羽便秉承他的旨意而公开上奏，王莽则磕头流泪，坚决推辞，对上以此迷惑太后，对下以此向百姓显示诚信。

起初，暗示益州刺史让塞外蛮夷进献白雉，元始元年正月，王莽禀告太后下诏书，用白雉祭祀宗庙。

大臣们于是上奏太后说：“委托大司马王莽定策安定宗庙。

前大司马霍光有安定宗庙的功劳，增加封邑三万户，他的爵位和封邑世世相传，与萧相国相同。

王莽应当按照霍光的旧例办理。”

太后问公卿们说：“果真因为大司马有大功应当表彰他呢？还是因为他是骨肉之亲才想要特殊对待他呢？”

于是大臣们极力陈述：“王莽的功德招致了像周成王时出现的白雉祥瑞，千年之间符命相同。

圣王的法度，臣子有大功的，在世时就有美好的称号，所以周公在世时就以周为称号。

王莽有安定国家、使汉家安宁的大功，应当赐封号为安汉公，增加封户，使爵位和封邑世世相传，上符合古代制度，下参照近代事例，以顺应天意。

太后诏令尚书办理这件事。

王莽上书说：“我和孔光、王舜、甄丰、甄邯共同定策，现在希望只列出孔光等人的功劳和赏赐，搁置我王莽，不要把我和他们放在一起。”

甄邯禀告太后下诏书说：“‘不偏私不结党，王道宽广平坦。’

您有安定宗庙的功劳，不能因为是骨肉之亲就隐瞒不宣扬。

您不要推辞。”

王莽又上书推辞。

太后命令谒者引导王莽到宫殿东厢房等候，王莽称病不肯进入。

太后派尚书令姚恂劝谕说：“您因为选任的缘故称病推辞，您责任重大，不能缺席，应当及时起身。”

王莽最终坚决推辞。

太后又派长信太仆王闳秉承诏令召见王莽，王莽坚决称病。

身边的人禀告太后，应该不要违背王莽的意愿，只列出孔光等人的功劳，王莽才肯起身。

四月，太后下诏说：“太傅博山侯孔光在四世君主在位期间担任宿卫，世代担任太傅、丞相，忠诚孝顺、仁爱笃厚，行为道义显著，建议定策，增加封邑一万户，任命孔光为太师，参与四辅的政务。

车骑将军安阳侯王舜积累仁孝之行，奉命迎接中山王，在万里之外挫败敌人，功德卓著，增加封邑一万户，任命王舜为太保。

左将军光禄勋甄丰在三世君主在位期间担任宿卫，忠诚守信、仁爱笃厚，奉命迎接中山王，辅导供养，使宗庙安宁，封甄丰为广阳侯，食邑五千户，任命甄丰为少傅。

以上三人都授予四辅的职务，他们的爵位和封邑世代相传，各赐第一等的宅第一处。

侍中奉车都尉甄邯在宿卫岗位上勤劳任职，建议定策，封甄邯为承阳侯，食邑二千四百户。

四人接受赏赐后，王莽还没有起身任职，大臣们又上奏说：“王莽虽然能够谦让，但朝廷应当表彰他，及时加以赏赐，明确重视首功之臣，不要让百官和百姓失望。”

太后于是下诏说：“大司马新都侯王莽三代担任三公，履行周公的职责，建立万世国策，功德成为忠臣的表率，教化流传全国，远方的人仰慕道义，越裳氏辗转翻译进献白雉。

现把召陵、新息两县的二万八千户加封给王莽，免除他后代的赋税徭役，他的爵位和封邑世代相传，按照萧何相国的先例封赏功勋。

把以前萧相国的上等宅第作为安汉公的宅第，在法令中明确规定，流传无穷。”

于是王莽感到惶恐，不得已才起身接受策命。

策文说：“汉朝危难，没有继承人，您制定国策，四辅的职责，三公的重任，都由您承担；

百官各部门，公卿大夫，都由您统领。

功德卓著，宗庙得以安宁，白雉的祥瑞，是周成王时代的景象再现。

因此赐给您美好的称号为安汉公，辅佐皇帝，希望达到天下太平，不要违背我的旨意。”

王莽接受太傅安汉公的称号，推辞退还增加的封邑和世代相传的爵位封邑，说希望等到百姓家家富足，然后再接受赏赐。

大臣们又争辩，太后下诏说：“您希望等到百姓家家富足，因此听从您的意见。

命令您的俸禄、侍从的赏赐都比原来加倍。

等到百姓家家富足，大司徒、大司空上报。”

王莽又推辞不接受，而建议说应当封立诸侯王的后代以及高祖以来功臣的子孙，大的封侯，有的赐爵关内侯并给予食邑，然后轮到在职官员，各有等级次序。

上可尊崇宗庙，增加礼乐制度，下可惠及士人百姓中的鳏寡之人，恩泽政策没有不施行的。

这些事记载在《平帝纪》中。

王莽已经使百姓喜悦，又想独断专行，知道太后厌倦政事，于是暗示公卿上奏说：“过去，官吏按功绩依次升迁到二千石，以及州部所举荐的茂材等特殊人才，大多不称职，应当都拜见安汉公。

另外太后不应当亲自过问小事。”

让太后下诏说：“皇帝年幼，我暂且统理政事，等到皇帝加冠。

如今各种事务繁琐细碎，我年纪已大，精力不能承受，恐怕这不是用来安养身体和培育皇帝的办法。

因此选用忠诚贤能之人，设立四辅，百官努力尽职，永久安康。

孔子说：‘多么崇高啊，舜、禹拥有天下却不亲自处理政务！’

从今以后，只有封爵之事才上报，其他事务，由安汉公、四辅裁决。

州牧、二千石以及初次任命的茂材吏上奏事务的，就引领到近署拜见安汉公，考察过去的官职表现，询问新职位的职责，以了解他们是否称职。”

于是王莽一一接见询问，表达深切的恩意，丰厚地加以赠送，对那些不合心意的，就公开上奏罢免他们，权力与君主相等了。

王莽想用虚名取悦太后，禀告说“亲自承接前代孝哀皇帝时丁、傅两家奢侈之后，百姓不富足的很多，太后应当暂且穿粗帛衣服，略微减少膳食，以昭示天下。”

王莽趁机上书，愿意献出一百万钱，三十顷田，交付大司农来资助贫民。

于是公卿都羡慕效仿他。

王莽率领群臣上奏说：“陛下年纪尊贵，长期穿厚粗帛，减少膳食，实在不是用来辅助精气，养育皇帝，安定宗庙的办法。

臣王莽多次在宫中省部门下叩头，禀告力争，未蒙允准。

现在幸赖陛下的德泽，近来风雨及时，甘露降下，神芝生长，蓂荚、朱草、嘉禾、吉祥的征兆同时都出现了。

臣王莽等人不胜最大的愿望，希望陛下爱惜精神，休养心神，放宽思虑，遵循帝王的常规服饰，恢复太官的法定膳食，使臣子们各自能尽到欢心，备办供奉之物。

希望您哀怜省察！”

王莽又让太后下诏说：“听说母后的道理，心思不超出宫门的界限。

国家不蒙上天保佑，皇帝在襁褓之中，不能亲自执政，我战战兢兢，担心宗庙不安。

国家的大纲，没有我谁来统领？

因此孔子进见南子，周公摄政，大概是权衡时势。

我勤身极思，忧虑劳苦没有安宁，所以国家奢侈就用俭朴来显示，纠正偏差要超过正常，而我不亲自带头，天下人会怎么说！

日夜梦想，五谷丰登，百姓家家富足，等到皇帝加冠，把政权委托给他。

现在实在无暇顾及轻靡的服饰和丰盛的美味，希望与百官有所成就，大家要努力啊！”

每当有水灾旱灾，王莽就吃素食，左右的人把这事报告上去。

太后派遣使者诏令王莽说：“听说您吃素食，忧虑百姓太深切了。

今年秋天幸好丰收，您勤于职守，按时吃肉，为国家爱护身体。”

王莽考虑中原已经平定，只有四方夷族没有变化，于是派遣使者携带黄金、钱币、丝帛，丰厚地贿赂匈奴单于，让他上书说：“听说中原讥讽双名，所以我的名字囊知牙斯现在改名为知，仰慕遵从圣朝制度。”

又派遣王昭君的女儿须卜居次进宫侍奉。

用来欺骗炫耀、献媚侍奉太后的手段，下至太后身边的侍从，方法多种多样。

王莽地位既已尊贵，想把女儿许配给皇帝做皇后，以巩固自己的权力，上奏说：“皇帝即位三年，皇后之位尚未确立，后宫嫔妃也未齐备。

从前，国家的危难，根源在于没有继承人，婚配不当。

请求考察讨论《五经》，制定嫁娶的礼仪，明确选取十二女的道理，以增加继承人。

广泛选取夏、商二王的后代以及在长安的周公、孔子后代中的列侯嫡女。

这件事交给有关部门办理，上报众多女子的名单，王氏家族的女子多在被选中的人当中。

王莽担心她们和自己的女儿竞争，就上奏说：“我自身没有德行，女儿的才能低下，不适合和众多女子一起被选取。”

太后认为他非常真诚，就下诏书说：“王氏家族的女子，是我的娘家人，不要选取她们。”

平民、儒生、郎官以上官员守候在宫门前上书的每天有一千多人，公卿大夫有的到朝廷中，有的伏在宫署门下，都说：

“英明诏令所体现的圣德如此崇高，安汉公的盛大功勋如此显著，现在应当确立皇后，为什么偏偏要废弃安汉公的女儿呢？天下人的心将归向何处！希望能让安汉公的女儿做天下人的母亲。”

王莽派长安令以下官员分别去劝说公卿和儒生停止上书，可是上书的人更多了。

太后迫不得已，听从公卿的意见选取王莽的女儿。

王莽又自己表白说：“应该广泛选取众多女子。”

公卿们争辩说：“不应该选取其他女子而使正统的地位出现二心。”

王莽说：“希望让我的女儿出来见见。”

太后派长乐少府、宗正、尚书令备礼去相看王莽的女儿，回来后上奏说：

“安汉公的女儿受到道德教化的熏陶，有美好的容貌，适合继承天命，侍奉祭祀。”

诏令派遣大司徒、大司空拿着策书去祭告宗庙，又用多种方式进行占卜，都说：

“占卜得到金水相生的吉兆，卦象显示父母得位，这就是所说的‘安康强健’的占卜结果，‘遇到吉祥’的符兆。”

信乡侯刘佟上奏说：“《春秋》记载，天子将要从纪国娶亲，就褒奖纪国国君，称他为侯，安汉公的封国不符合古代制度。”

这件事交给有关部门，他们都说：“古代天子封皇后的父亲方圆百里的土地，尊重他而不把他当作臣子，以此重视宗庙，这是最大的孝道。

刘佟的话符合礼制，可以批准。请求把新野县二万五千六百顷田地加封给王莽，使他的封国满百里。”

王莽辞谢说：“我的女儿确实不配匹配最尊贵的人，又听从大家的意见，加封我的土地。

我暗自思量，得以托身于皇室亲属之中，获得爵位和土地，如果我的女儿真能胜任奉承圣德，我的封国食邑足够供给朝贡之物，不需要再增加土地的恩宠。

希望归还所增加的土地。”太后批准了。

有关部门上奏说：“按照旧例，聘娶皇后用黄金二万斤，折合钱二万万。”

王莽极力辞让，接受了四千万，而把其中的三千三百万给予了十一位陪嫁女子的家庭。

群臣又说：“现在皇后接受的聘礼，比各位姬妾多不了多少。”

于是下诏书，再增加二千三百万，合计为三千万。

王莽又把其中的一千万分给了九族中的贫苦人家。

陈崇当时担任大司徒司直，和张敞的孙子张竦关系友好。

张竦是个博学通达的人，替陈崇起草奏章，称颂王莽的功德，陈崇上奏了这份奏章，说：

我私下看到安汉公从刚开始求学时起，正赶上社会风气崇尚奢侈华丽的时代，承蒙成帝和太后厚待亲属的恩宠，蒙受各位叔父显赫的荣光，财产富足，权势很大，没有什么事情不顺心，

然而他降低身份施行仁爱，克制自己遵守礼仪，违背世俗矫正风气，坚定地特立独行；

穿粗劣的衣服，吃粗淡的食物，乘坐简陋的车子，使用劣等的马匹，配偶没有第二个，家门之内，孝顺友爱的品德，众人没有不知道的；

清心寡欲，乐于正道，温和善良，谦恭地对待士人，对老朋友有恩惠，对老师朋友很忠厚。

孔子说：“不如贫穷却快乐，富有却爱好礼仪”，说的就是安汉公啊。

到担任侍中时，原定陵侯淳于长犯有大逆不道的罪行，安汉公不敢徇私情，建议诛杀讨伐他。

周公诛杀管叔、蔡叔，季子用毒酒杀死叔牙，说的就是安汉公啊。

因此孝成皇帝任命安汉公为大司马，把国家的统治大权委托给他。

孝哀皇帝即位后，骄横的妃妾觊觎（太后之位），奸臣开始活动，安汉公亲手弹劾高昌侯董宏，纠正了原定陶共王母亲（超越本分的）僭越座位。

从此以后，朝廷大臣讨论议事，没有不依据经典的。

（安汉公）因病辞去职位，回到自己的府第，被奸贼陷害。

到封国之后，孝哀皇帝醒悟，又把安汉公召回长安，（皇帝）病重加剧时，仍然没有忘记安汉公，又特意提升他的职位。

当晚局势仓促，国家没有皇位继承人，奸臣充斥朝廷，危险到了极点。

我考虑安定国家的计策没有比安汉公更合适的，把您召进朝廷，当天就罢免斥退了高安侯董贤，顷刻之间，忠诚的计策就制定出来，国家纲纪都得以确立。

绥和、元寿年间，两次遭遇皇帝去世，各种事务都得到处理，祸乱没有发生。

辅佐我五年，人伦的根本得以端正，天地的位置得以确定。

恭敬地侍奉神灵，治理四季农事，恢复了千年废弃的制度，纠正了百代的失误，天下和谐会集，大众刚刚安定。

《诗经》记载的灵台，《尚书》记载的建造雒邑，镐京的制度，商邑的法度，到现在又重新兴盛起来。

彰显先帝的伟大功勋，阐明祖宗的美好德行，推崇宣扬尊父配天的大义，修立郊祀、禘祭、宗祀的礼仪，以此光大孝道。

因此四海之内和谐融洽，各国仰慕仁义，风俗不同的蛮夷，不用召唤自己前来，逐渐被教化，穿着礼服礼帽，进献珍宝辅助祭祀。

遵循旧有的根本大道，遵行儒术重视古代传统，行动就能成功，事情做得恰到好处。

最高的德行和重要的道理，与神灵相通，祖先神灵欣然享用祭祀。

光辉显耀，上天符命不断到来，宇宙间的元气和谐统一。

麒麟、凤凰、龟、龙，各种吉祥的征兆，有七百多种。

于是制定礼制，创作乐教，有安定宗庙社稷的伟大功勋。

普天之下，都依赖安汉公，官职是宰衡，地位是上公。

现在加赐九命的赏赐，用以辅助祭祀，共同担任文武官职，并且延及您的祖先。

呜呼，这难道不是美好的事吗！

于是王莽磕头拜了两拜，接受了绿色的蔽膝、衮衣、冠冕、衣裳，镶玉的刀鞘饰、刀鞘底饰，钩形履，有鸾铃的辂车和四匹马，有九旒的龙旗，皮弁和白色的下衣，戎车和四匹马，红色的弓和箭，黑色的弓和箭，左边树立红色的斧钺，右边树立金色的戚，铠甲和头盔各一套，黑黍酿造的香酒两卣，玉勺两个，九命青玉圭两个，朱漆大门和檐内台阶。

设置宗官、祝官、卜官、史官，虎贲勇士三百人，家令、家丞各一人，宗、祝、卜、史官都设置啬夫，辅佐安汉公。

在宫中官署和外面的府第，虎贲勇士担任门卫，应当出入的人要登记名册。

从四辅、三公起，有事务到府第，都要使用通行证。

把楚王的官邸作为安汉公的府第，大规模修缮整治，使周围的警卫相通。

祖先的祖庙和寝庙都设置朱漆大门和檐内台阶。

陈崇又上奏说：“安汉公祭祀祖先，出城门时，城门校尉应当率领骑士跟随。

入城有门卫，出城有骑士，这是用来重视国家的礼仪。”奏章被批准。

这年秋天，王莽因为皇后有了子孙的祥瑞，开通了子午道。

子午道从杜陵一直穿过南山，直通汉中。

八个风俗使者回来，说天下风俗整齐一致，他们伪造各郡国的歌谣，歌颂王莽的功德，共三万字。

王莽上奏把这些歌谣定为法令。

又上奏说市场上没有两种价格，官府没有诉讼案件，城邑没有盗贼，乡村没有饥民，路上没有人拾取别人丢失的东西，实行男女分道而行的制度，违犯的人处以象征性的刑罚。

刘歆、陈崇等十二人都因为修建明堂，宣扬教化，被封为列侯。

王莽已经实现了天下太平，北方感化了匈奴，东方招来了海外国家，南方怀柔了黄支国，只有西方还没有什么举措。

于是派遣中郎将平宪等人携带很多黄金和财物，引诱塞外的羌人，让他们献上土地，愿意归属汉朝。

平宪等人上奏说：“羌人首领良愿等部落，人口约一万二千人，愿意做汉朝的臣民，献上鲜水海、允谷盐池，平坦的土地和丰美的草原都给予汉朝百姓，自己居住在险峻阻塞的地方作为屏障。

询问良愿归降的意图，他回答说：‘太皇太后圣明，安汉公最仁慈，天下太平，五谷丰登，有的禾苗长到一丈多高，有的一个谷穗有三颗谷粒，有的不用播种自行生长，有的不用养蚕自行结茧，甘露从天而降，美酒从地下涌出，“凤凰雌雄都已飞来”，神鸟降落栖息，因此四年来羌人没有遭受什么苦难。所以“啊！多么令人愉悦”能被接纳进入汉朝，成为您的臣民。’

应当及时安排他们从事生产，设置属国都尉来管辖保护他们。”

这件事交给王莽处理，王莽又上奏说：“太后执掌政权多年，恩泽遍布，祥和之气充满四方，遥远的地方和不同风俗的民族，没有不仰慕仁义的。

越裳氏经过辗转翻译来献上白雉，黄支国从三万里外进贡活犀牛，东夷王漂过大海奉献国宝，匈奴单于顺应制度，改掉两个字的名字，现在西域良愿等人又献上土地成为臣属，从前唐尧的恩德广被四方，也不过如此。

现在查考已有东海郡、南海郡、北海郡，还没有西海郡，请求接受良愿等人献上的土地作为西海郡。

我又听说圣明的君王排列天文，确定地理，依据山川和民俗来划定州界。

汉朝的土地比唐尧、虞舜二帝和夏、商、周三代君王的广阔，共有十三州，州名和州界大多不符合经书的记载。

《尧典》记载有十二州，后来确定为九州。

汉朝开拓的土地辽阔遥远，州牧巡视辖区，最远的有三万多里，不能分为九州。

谨请依据经书的义理订正十二州的名称和分界，以符合正确的开端。”奏章被批准。

又增加法令五十条，违犯的人迁徙到西海郡。

被迁徙的人成千上万，百姓开始怨恨了。

泉陵侯刘庆上书说：“周成王年幼，称为孺子，周公代理朝政。

现在皇帝年纪还小，应当让安汉公行使天子的职权，像周公那样。”群臣都说：“应当按照刘庆说的做。”

冬季，火星进入月球背面。

平帝生病，王莽制作策书，到泰畤祈祷，佩戴玉璧，手持玉圭，愿意用自己代替平帝。

把策书藏在金縢柜中，放在前殿，告诫大臣们不要说出去。

十二月，平帝去世，大赦天下。

王莽征召通晓礼仪的宗伯凤等人，和他们商定全国六百石以上的官吏都服丧三年。

上奏请求尊称孝成帝庙为统宗，孝平帝庙为元宗。

当时元帝的后代已经断绝，而宣帝的曾孙中有五个王在世，列侯广戚侯刘显等四十八人，王莽嫌他们年纪大，说：“兄弟之间不能互相作为后代。

于是挑选玄孙中年龄最小的广戚侯的儿子刘婴，年仅两岁，假托说占卜和相面的结果最吉利。

这个月，前辉光谢嚣上奏说武功县长孟通疏浚水井时得到一块白石，上面圆形下面方形，有红色的文字写在石头上，文字是：“告知安汉公王莽为皇帝。”

符命的兴起，从这时开始了。

王莽让大臣们把这件事禀告太后，太后说：“这是欺骗天下人，不能实行！”

太保王舜对太后说：“事情已经到了这个地步，没有办法了，要阻止也阻止不了。而且王莽不敢有别的想法，只是想称代理皇帝来加重他的权力，镇服天下罢了。”

太后听从了他的意见。

王舜等人就一起让太后下诏书说：“听说上天生下众百姓，不能互相治理，为他们设立君主来统治管理他们。

君主年纪幼小，必定要有可寄托的人来代理朝政，这样才能承受上天的布施，完成大地的化育，使万物生长繁育。

《尚书》上不是说过吗？‘上天的工作，由人来代替。’

我因为孝平皇帝年幼，暂且统理国政，期望他长大成人，把政权委托给他。

现在他短命去世，呜呼哀哉！

已经命令有关部门征召孝宣皇帝的二十三位玄孙，挑选合适的人，来继承孝平皇帝的后代。

玄孙还在襁褓之中，如果没有极有德行的君子，谁能安定他？

安汉公王莽辅佐朝政三代，屡次遭遇机会，安定光大汉朝，使不同风俗的人都能统一，至于制礼作乐，与周公在不同时代却有相同的符命。

现在前辉光谢嚣、武功县长孟通上报丹石的符命，我深思其中的意思，说‘为皇帝’，是指代理行使皇帝的职权。

有了法度就容易成功，不是圣人就没有法度。

命令安汉公登上皇位代理朝政，像周公的旧例一样，把武功县作为安汉公的采地，命名为汉光邑。

准备好礼仪奏上。”

于是群臣上奏说：“太后圣德明显，深刻洞察天意，诏令安汉公代理朝政。

我们听说周成王年幼，周朝的治国之道尚未完成，成王不能恭敬地侍奉天地，继承文王、武王的功业。

周公权衡形势而代理朝政，于是周朝的治国之道得以完成，王室安定；不代理朝政，就恐怕周朝会坠落而失去天命。

《尚书》说：‘我们继承事业的子孙，很不能恭敬地侍奉天地，断绝失去前人的荣光，在诸侯家不知道天命的艰难。上天应辅助诚信的人，才不会失去天命。’

解释说：周公戴着天子的礼帽，面向南接见群臣，发号施令，常常称是周王的命令。

召公是贤人，不了解圣人的心意，所以不高兴。

《礼记·明堂记》说‘周公在明堂接见诸侯，像天子一样，背靠画有斧形花纹的屏风面向南站立。’

说的是‘周公登上天子之位，六年接见诸侯，制定礼制，创作乐教，天下人都非常信服’。

召公不高兴。当时武王刚去世，粗麻丧服还没有除去。

由此说来，周公开始代理朝政时就居于天子之位，不是到六年才登上王位。

《尚书》失传的《嘉禾篇》说：‘周公捧着香酒站在东阶上，迎接诸侯登上台阶，赞辞说：代理国王临朝理政，努力使天下和谐。’

这是周公代理朝政时，赞礼的人所称呼的。

周成王成年加冠后，周公就归还政权。

《尚书》说：‘我把明君的权力归还给你’，周公常常称是周王的命令，自主行事不请示汇报，所以说我把明君的权力归还给你。

我们请求安汉公登上王位代理朝政，穿着天子的礼服礼帽，背靠门窗之间画有斧形花纹的屏风，面向南接见群臣，处理政务。

车马服饰出入时要清道戒严，平民和臣子都自称臣妾，全都依照天子的制度。

在郊外祭祀天地，在明堂祭祀祖宗，在宗庙祭祀祖先，祭祀众神，赞辞称‘假皇帝’，平民和臣子称他‘摄皇帝’，他自称‘予’。

公平处理朝廷事务，常用皇帝的诏书形式称‘制’，以顺应上天之心，辅助汉室，保护孝平皇帝的幼嗣，完成寄托的大义，兴盛太平的教化。

他朝见太皇太后、皇后时，都恢复臣子的礼节。

在自己的宫室、封国、采地自行施行政治教化，依照诸侯礼仪的旧例。

我们冒死罪请求。”太后下诏说：“可以。”

第二年，改年号为“居摄”。

居摄元年正月，王莽在南郊祭祀上帝，在东郊迎接春天，在明堂举行大射礼，奉养三老、五更，礼仪完毕后离去。

设置柱下五史，俸禄如同御史，旁听处理政务，在旁边记录言行。

三月己丑日，立宣帝玄孙刘婴为皇太子，号称孺子。

任命王舜为太傅左辅，甄丰为太阿右拂，甄邯为太保后承。

又设置四少，俸禄都是二千石。

四月，安众侯刘崇和他的国相张绍商议说：“安汉公王莽独揽朝政，必定会危害刘氏王朝。

天下反对他的人，却没有人敢首先行动，这是宗室的耻辱。

我率领宗族率先行动，全国必定会响应。”

张绍等跟随他的有一百多人，于是进攻宛城，没能攻进去就失败了。

张绍是张竦的堂兄。

张竦和刘崇的族父刘嘉到皇宫自首，王莽赦免了他们，没有治罪。

张竦于是替刘嘉写了一份奏章说：

建平、元寿年间，皇位继承几乎断绝，宗室几乎被废弃。

幸亏依靠陛下的圣德，尽力挽救，保护扶持，国家命运得以延续，宗室重见光明。

到临朝执政，发号施令，行动以宗室为先，提拔任用九族的人优先。

同时录用旁支亲属，封立王侯，面南称王称侯的人，数以百计。

恢复已经断绝的亲属关系，使灭亡的得以存在、废弃的得以延续，能够与其他人并列，重新成为人的，众多成行，以此来屏卫汉朝，辅助汉宗室。

修建太学，建立明堂，颁布上天的法则，传播圣人的教化，接见诸侯，彰显文德，宗室诸侯，都增加了封地。

天下人仰望期盼，伸颈赞叹，颂声洋溢，充耳可闻。

国家之所以能享有这样的美誉，获得这样的名声，享受这样的福分，得到这样的荣耀，难道不是太皇太后日理万机的思虑，陛下日夜警惕的挂念吗！

为什么呢？因为遇到混乱就加以治理，遇到危险就使它安定，遇到灾祸就引向福祉，遇到断绝就延续其统绪，遇到幼主就代替他承担责任，早晚辛劳，寒暑不懈，没有休息的时候，孜孜不倦，所有这些都是为了上天，厚待刘氏。

臣子无论愚笨聪明，百姓无论男女，都明白您的深远用意。

然而安众侯刘崇却偏偏怀着荒谬迷惑之心，抱着叛逆的念头，兴师动众，想要危害宗庙，恶行令人不忍听闻，罪行大到处死都不能抵偿，实在是臣子的仇敌，宗室的仇人，国家的蟊贼，天下的祸害。

因此亲属震惊而告发他的罪行，百姓溃散背叛而抛弃他的兵器，前进不了半步，后退就遭受灾祸。

百岁的母亲，还在襁褓中的婴儿，同时被斩杀，头颅悬挂在竹竿顶端，珠耳环还在耳上，首饰依然存在，如此谋划，难道不荒谬吗！

我听说古代叛逆的国家，被讨伐诛杀之后，就把它的宫室挖成水池，用来容纳污浊之物，名叫凶墟，即使长出蔬菜，人们也不吃。

用墙把它的神社围起来，上面覆盖下面铺垫，以示阴阳不通。

把这种处置神社的方式通报诸侯，让他们出门就能看到，作为明显的警戒。

当今天下听说刘崇叛乱，都想撩起衣襟手持宝剑去呵斥他。

那些先赶到的人，会砍他的脖子，刺他的胸膛，劈他的身体，割他的肌肉；

后赶到的人，想拆他的门，推倒他的墙，铲平他的屋，烧毁他的器物，响应之声使地面震动，即刻造成创伤。

而宗室尤其痛恨，说起他来必定咬牙切齿。

为什么呢？因为他背叛恩义，不知道重要的恩德在哪里。

宗室居住的地方有的遥远，我刘嘉有幸能先听到消息，满腔愤怒无法抑制，愿意作为宗室的表率，父子兄弟背着筐扛着锹，奔赴南阳，把刘崇的宫室挖成水池，使它符合古代制度。

至于刘崇的神社应当像毫社一样处理，把它赐给诸侯，用来永远作为借鉴。

希望把这件事交给四辅、公卿大夫讨论，以表明善恶，昭示天下。

于是王莽非常高兴。

公卿们说：“都应该按照刘嘉说的办。”

王莽禀告太后下诏书说：“刘嘉父子兄弟，虽然和刘崇有亲属关系，却不敢偏私，有的看到叛乱的苗头，就相继告发他，等到灾祸形成，就共同把他当作仇敌，符合古代制度，忠孝之心显著。

以杜衍县一千户封刘嘉为师礼侯，刘嘉的七个儿子都赐爵关内侯。”

后来又封张竦为淑德侯。

长安人为此编了句俗语说：“想要得封爵，去找张伯松；拼死战斗，不如巧妙上奏。”

王莽又封赏南阳郡有功劳的官吏和平民一百多人，把刘崇的住宅掘成污池。

后来图谋反叛的人，他们的住宅都被掘成污池。

大臣们又禀告说：“刘崇等人图谋叛逆，是因为王莽权力太轻。

应该增强他的权力来镇服全国。”

五月甲辰日，太后下诏令王莽朝见太后时自称“假皇帝”。

冬季十月丙辰朔日，发生日食。

十二月，大臣们上奏请求：“增加安汉公的宫室和家吏，设置率更令，庙长、庙丞、厩长、厩丞、厨长、厨丞，中庶子，虎贲勇士以下一百多人，又设置卫士三百人。

安汉公的官署称为摄省，官衙称为摄殿，住宅称为摄宫。”奏章被批准。

王莽禀告太后下诏书说：“前太师孔光虽然早已去世，功绩已经列录。

太保王舜、大司空甄丰、轻车将军甄邯、步兵将军孙建都为招引单于出谋划策，又主管灵台、明堂、辟雍、四郊祭祀，制定制度，开辟子午道，和宰衡同心同德，齐心合力，功德卓著。

封王舜的儿子王匡为同心侯，王林为说德侯，孔光的孙子孔寿为合意侯，甄丰的孙子甄匡为并力侯。

给甄邯、孙建各增加三千户封邑。”

这一年，西羌庞恬、傅幡等人怨恨王莽夺取他们的土地设置西海郡，反过来攻打西海太守程永，程永逃跑。

王莽处死了程永，派遣护羌校尉窦况攻打西羌。

居摄二年春季，窦况等人打败了西羌。

五月，改铸货币：错刀，一枚值五千钱；契刀，一枚值五百钱；大钱，一枚值五十钱，和五铢钱同时流通。

老百姓有很多私自铸钱的。

禁令列侯以下的人不得私自拥有黄金，要把黄金送到御府换钱，然而最终没有付给他们钱。

九月，东郡太守翟义趁着举行检阅的机会，部署战车骑兵，趁机调动应急部队，拥立严乡侯刘信为天子，向各郡国发送檄文，说“王莽毒死平帝，代理天子之位，想要断绝汉朝江山，现在共同执行上天的惩罚诛杀王莽”。

各郡国感到疑惑，翟义的部众有十多万人。

王莽惊慌恐惧得吃不下饭，日夜抱着孺子到郊祀祭坛和宗庙祷告，仿照《大诰》写了策书，派遣谏大夫桓谭等人颁布到全国，告知自己代理皇位将来会把政权归还给孺子的意思。

派遣王邑、孙建等八位将军攻打翟义，分别驻扎在各关隘，守卫险要之处。

槐里男子赵明、霍鸿等人起兵响应翟义，互相谋划说：“将领们的精锐部队都向东进发，京城空虚，可以攻打长安。”

部众逐渐增多，将近十万人，王莽害怕了，派遣将军王奇、王级率军抵抗他们。

任命太保甄邯为大将军，在高帝庙授予他斧钺，统领全国的军队，左手持节，右手握钺，驻扎在城外。

王舜、甄丰日夜在宫殿中巡逻。

十二月，王邑等人在圉县打败翟义。

司威陈崇作为监军上书说：“陛下遵循上天的大法，心意与宝龟相合，承受天命，预知成败，都与占卜的预兆相符，这就是与天相配。

与天相配的君主，思考就能改变气象，说话就能使万物运动，施政就能成就教化。

我陈崇伏读诏书下达的日子，私下计算当时的情况，陛下的思虑刚开始萌发，反贼就已经被打败；诏书刚开始写，反贼就大败；制书刚下达，反贼就全部被斩杀，将领们还没来得及施展他们的锋芒，我陈崇还没来得及尽献我的愚见，事情就已经解决了。”

王莽非常高兴。

居摄三年春季，发生地震。大赦天下。

王邑等人回到京城，向西和王级等人联合攻打赵明、霍鸿，把他们全部打败消灭，这些事记载在《翟义传》里。

王莽在未央宫白虎殿大摆酒宴，犒劳赏赐将帅，诏令陈崇评定军功，排列高低等级。

王莽于是上奏说：“圣明的时代，国家有很多贤人，所以唐尧、虞舜的时候，几乎家家户户都可以受封，等到功业成就，就加以赏赐。

至于夏禹在涂山会集诸侯，拿着玉帛的有一万个国家，诸侯拿着玉，附庸拿着帛。

周武王在孟津会盟，还有八百诸侯。

周公代理朝政时，在郊外祭祀后稷以配享上天，在明堂祭祀文王以配享上帝，因此四海之内的诸侯各自按照自己的职责前来祭祀，大约有一千八百个诸侯。

《礼记·王制》记载有一千七百多个国家，因此孔子著《孝经》说：‘不敢遗漏小国的臣子，更何况对公、侯、伯、子、男呢？所以能得到万国的欢心来侍奉他们的先王。’这就是天子的孝道。

秦朝不行正道，消灭诸侯设置郡县，想要独占天下的利益，所以两代就灭亡了。

高皇帝承受天命消灭残贼，考核功绩施行赏赐，建立了几百个诸侯国，后来逐渐衰微，剩下的仅存无几。

太皇太后亲自掌握国家大纲，广泛封赏有功德的人以鼓励行善，复兴灭亡的国家、延续断绝的后代以永传不绝，因此广泛深入的教化得以传播，不久就要完成。

遇到羌人侵扰西海郡，反贼在东郡散布流言，逆贼在西方蛊惑民众，忠臣孝子没有不愤怒的，所讨伐的都被消灭，全部伏罪，天下都安定了。

现在制定礼乐，确实考察了周朝的爵位分为五等，封地分为四等，有明确的文字记载；殷朝的爵位分为三等，有相关说法，但没有文字记载。

孔子说：‘周朝借鉴夏、商两代，礼乐制度多么丰富美好啊！我遵从周朝的制度。’

我请求对各位应当接受爵位和封邑的将帅，按照五等爵位、四等封地进行封赏。”奏章被批准。

于是受封的人高的封为侯、伯，其次封为子、男，应当赐爵关内侯的改名为附城，共有几百人。

攻打西海郡的人以“羌”为称号，攻打槐里的人以“武”为称号，攻打翟义的人以“虏”为称号。

大臣们又上奏说：“太后评定功劳、记录德行，远的上溯千年，近的就在当世，有的因文治受封，有的因武功得爵，无论功绩深浅大小，没有不被论功行赏的。

现在代理皇帝背靠斧纹屏风登上皇位，应当与担任宰相治理国家时不同，制礼作乐虽然还未完成，应当晋升他两个儿子的爵位都为公。

《春秋》说‘嘉奖善人要延及他的子孙’，‘贤人的后代，应当有土地’。

周成王广泛封赏周公的六个庶子，都有封地。

至于汉朝著名的丞相、大将萧何、霍光之类，都惠及旁支庶子。

兄长的儿子王光，可以先封为列侯；各个孙子，等制度全部完成后，由大司徒、大司空上报名字，按照从前的诏书办理。”

太后下诏说：“晋升代理皇帝的儿子褒新侯王安为新举公，赏都侯王临为褒新公，封王光为衍功侯。”

这时，王莽交还新都国，大臣们又禀告请求封王莽的孙子王宗为新都侯。

王莽消灭翟义之后，自认为威望和德行日益兴盛，得到上天和百姓的帮助，于是谋划正式称帝的事。

九月，王莽的母亲功显君去世，他的心思不在哀悼上，让太后下诏讨论他应服的丧服。

少阿、羲和刘歆和博士、儒生七十八人都说：“代理朝政的意义，在于统一建立上天的功业，兴盛推崇帝王之道，完成法度，安定全国。

从前商汤去世后，太子早夭，他的儿子太甲年幼不明事理，伊尹把他放逐到桐宫而代理朝政，以兴盛商朝的王道。

周武王去世后，周朝的王道尚未完成，成王年幼，周公扶持成王而代理朝政，以完成周朝的王道。

因此商朝有恭谨美好的教化，周朝有刑罚搁置不用的功绩。

如今太皇太后接连遭遇家中不幸，委任安汉公治理百官，平定天下。

遇上孺子年幼，不能恭敬地侍奉天地神灵，皇天降下祥瑞，出现丹石符命，因此太皇太后顺应上天明命，诏令安汉公代理皇位，将以此成就圣明汉朝的大业，与唐尧、虞舜、夏商周三代比美。

代理皇帝于是打开秘府，会集儒生，制定礼乐，最终确定百官制度，盛大地完成了上天的功业。

圣明的心思周密详尽，卓越独特的见解，发掘出周朝礼制，以明了继承与借鉴，效法上天，考察古制，加以增减，就像孔子听到《韶》乐，像日月一样高不可攀，不是圣明智慧达到极致，谁能做到这样！

大纲和细目都已完备，成功在即，这就是用来保佑圣明汉朝，安定百姓的成效。

如今功显君去世，《礼记》说：‘庶子作为继承人，为他的母亲服缌麻之丧。’

传文说：‘与尊贵的人成为一体，不敢为自己的亲属服丧。’

代理皇帝以圣德承受皇天的使命，接受太后的诏令代理皇位，侍奉汉朝大宗的后代，对上有天地社稷的重任，对下有百姓万机的忧虑，不能顾及自己的亲属。

因此太皇太后立他的长孙，使他为新都侯，作为哀侯的后代。

表明代理皇帝与尊贵的人成为一体，承继宗庙祭祀，侍奉供养太皇太后，不能为自己的亲属服丧。

《周礼》说‘帝王为诸侯服缌麻丧’，‘戴弁加环绖’，同姓用麻，异姓用葛。

代理皇帝应当为功显君服缌麻丧，戴弁加麻环绖，如同天子吊唁诸侯的丧服，以符合圣制。’

王莽于是照办，总共吊唁两次聚会两次，而让新都侯王宗主持丧事，服丧三年。

司威陈崇上奏，衍功侯王光私下告知执金吾窦况，让他杀人，窦况为此逮捕了那人，将其依法治罪。

王莽大怒，严厉责备王光。

王光的母亲说：“你自己看和王宇、王获相比怎么样？”

于是母子自杀，连同窦况都死了。

起初，王莽以侍奉母亲、供养嫂子、抚养侄子闻名，到后来却违背情理变得残暴，又用这来显示公正大义。

让王光的儿子王嘉继承爵位为侯。

王莽下书说：“停止娱乐的礼仪，到冬季末尾结束，正月郊祀，各种乐器应当演奏。

王公卿士，音乐共分几等？五声八音，各条是什么？

可与所属儒生各自尽心思考，详尽陈述它们的意义。”

这一年，广饶侯刘京，车骑将军千人扈云、太保属官臧鸿上奏符命。

刘京说齐郡有新井，扈云说巴郡有石牛，臧鸿说扶风雍县有石，王莽都迎接接受了。

十一月甲子日，王莽上奏太后说：

陛下最圣明，遭逢皇家处于不幸境地，遇到汉朝十二代二百一十年的厄运，承受上天威严的命令，诏令臣王莽居位摄政，接受孺子的托付，承担天下的重任。

臣王莽兢兢业业，担心不能称职。

皇族广饶侯刘京上书说：“七月中旬，齐郡临淄县昌兴亭亭长辛当一夜多次做梦，梦见有人说：‘我是天帝的使者。天帝派我告诉亭长说：“摄政皇帝应当成为真皇帝。如果不相信我，这个亭中会有一口新井。”’亭长早晨起来查看亭中，确实有一口新井，深入地下将近一百尺。”

十一月壬子日，正当冬至，巴郡的石牛，戊午日，雍县有文字的石头，都运到了未央宫的前殿。

臣和太保安阳侯王舜等人去查看，天上刮起大风，尘土飞扬，天昏地暗，风停之后，在石头前面得到了铜符和帛图，上面的文字是：上天告知皇帝的符命，进献的人封侯。承受天命，执行神的命令。”

骑都尉崔发等人查看并解说其含义。

以及从前孝哀皇帝建平二年六月甲子日下诏书，改年号为太初元将元年，考察那件事的原委，甘忠可、夏贺良的谶书收藏在兰台。

臣王莽认为元将元年，是大将居位摄政改元的文字预兆。到现在应验了。

《尚书·康诰》记载“王这样说：‘诸侯之长，朕的弟弟，小子封。’”这是周公居位摄政时称王的文字记载。

《春秋》记载鲁隐公不说即位，因为他是摄政。

这两部经书是周公、孔子所编定的，大概是为后代制定的法则。

孔子说：“敬畏天命，敬畏地位尊贵的人，敬畏圣人的话。”

臣王莽怎敢不秉承执行！

臣请求在恭敬地侍奉天地神灵和祖宗宗庙，向太皇太后、孝平皇后奏报时，都自称假皇帝。

至于向天下发号施令，天下臣民上奏言事，不要再提“摄政”。

把居摄三年改为初始元年，计时器以一百二十刻为标准，以顺应天命。

臣王莽日夜养育孺子使他长大成人，让他的品德能和周成王相比，向四面八方宣扬太皇太后的威严德行，希望做到使百姓富足并加以教化。

等到孺子举行加冠礼之后，就把政权归还给他，如同周公当年的旧例。

奏章被批准了。

百姓们知道他信奉符命，示意大臣们广泛讨论并另外上奏，以此显示他要成为真皇帝的趋势。

期门郎张充等六人谋划一起劫持王莽，拥立楚王。被发觉后，处死。

梓潼人哀章，在长安求学，一向品行不端，喜欢说大话。

看到王莽摄政，就制作了一个铜柜，做了两个封签，其中一个写着“天帝行玺金匮图”，另一个写着“赤帝行玺某传予黄帝金策书”。

某，是高皇帝的名字。

文书说王莽是真天子，皇太后应遵从天命。

图和书都写了王莽的八位大臣，又选取了吉祥的名字王兴、王盛，哀章趁机把自己的名字也加了进去，总共十一人，都写上了官爵，作为辅佐之臣。

哀章听说齐郡新井、巴郡石牛的事已经下传，当天傍晚，穿着黄色的衣服，拿着铜柜到高帝庙，把它交给了仆射。

仆射把这件事上报了。

戊辰日，王莽到高帝庙拜受金匮禅位的符命。

戴上皇帝的王冠，拜见太后，回来坐在未央宫前殿，下诏书说：

我德行不足，有幸托身于皇初祖考黄帝的后代，皇始祖考虞帝的后裔，以及太皇太后的旁支亲属。

皇天上帝降下大恩大力保佑，既定的天命让我继承大统，符契、图文、金匮、策书，都是神明的指示，把天下亿万百姓托付给我。

赤帝汉朝高皇帝的神灵，秉承天命，传下禅让国家的金策书，我非常敬畏，怎敢不恭敬接受！

在戊辰日，正当定日，戴上皇帝的王冠，登上真天子之位，确定拥有天下的国号叫“新”。

更改历法，变换车马服饰的颜色，改变祭祀用的牲畜，改换旗帜标志，变更器物制度。

把十二月初一癸酉日作为建国元年正月初一，以鸡叫的时刻作为一天的开始。

车马服饰的颜色与五行德性相配崇尚黄色，祭祀用的牲畜与正月相应采用白色，使节所持的旄幡都用纯黄色，上面题写“新使五威节”，以秉承皇天上帝的威严命令。</div>

          <div class="txt">Wang Mang, whose courtesy given name was Chü-chün, was the son of [Wang Wan], a younger [half] brother of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] Hsiao-yüan.

The father, [Wang Chin], and the [living] elder and younger brothers of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] Yüan were all enfeoffed as marquises during the reigns of [Emperors] Yüan and Ch'eng. They occupied [high] positions and had important influence in the government. In the clan there were nine marquises and five Commanders-in-chief. A discussion is in the "Memoir of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] Yüan."

Only [Wang] Mang's father, [Wang] Wan, who had died young, was not made a marquis.

The various elder and younger cousins of [Wang] Mang were all the sons of Generals or of the Five Marquises, so they took advantage of their opportunities and were extravagant. In their equipages and horses, music and women, idleness and gadding they competed with one another.

[Wang] Mang alone was an orphan and in humble circumstances, hence he humbled himself and made himself courteous and temperate.

In studying the Classic of Rites [the Yi-li], he rendered to Ch'en Ts'an, [a man] from P'ei Commandery, the services due to a teacher. [Wang Mang] fatigued himself and studied extensively, wearing garments like the Confucian masters.

He served his mother and the widow of his elder brother, [Wang Yung], and reared [Wang Kuang], the orphaned son of his elder brother. Thus his conduct was quite perfect.

Moreover, outside [his clan] he associated with eminent persons, and within [his clan] he served his various uncles, paying minute attention to the spirit of the rules of proper conduct.

During [the period] Yang-so, when his paternal first uncle who was the heir of his grandfather, the General-in-chief, [Wang] Feng, became ill, [Wang] Mang waited upon him in his illness, himself tasting the medicine [before administering it]. For successive months, [Wang Mang's] hair was disordered, his face uncleansed, and he did not [even] loosen the girdle to his garments.

When [Wang] Feng was about to die, he therefore confided [Wang Mang] to the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] and Emperor [Ch'eng]. He was installed as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate and was promoted to be Colonel of the Archers Who Shoot By Sound.

After a long time, his paternal uncle who was younger than [Wang Mang's] father, the Marquis of Ch'eng-tu, [Wang] Shang, memorialized that he wished to divide the households of his estate in order to enfeoff [Wang Mang]. Moreover, the Privy Treasurer of the Ch'ang-lo [Palace], Tai Ch'ung, the Palace Attendant, Chin Shê, the Colonel of Northern Barbarian Cavalry, Chi Hung, the Chief Commandant of Shang-ku [Commandery], Yang Ping, and the Gentleman-of-the-Household, Ch'en T'ang, who were all gentlemen well-known in that age, all spoke in behalf of [Wang] Mang. Because of that, the Emperor esteemed [Wang] Mang.

In the first year of [the period] Yung-shih, he enfeoffed [Wang] Mang as Marquis of Hsin-tu with an estate of fifteen hundred households in the Tu District of Hsin-yeh [County] in Nan-yang [Commandery].

He was promoted to be Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Imperial Household Grandee, and Palace Attendant, and was careful as [an imperial] guard. As his noble rank and position became more and more honorable, his conduct became more and more humble.

He distributed equipages and horses, clothes, and fur garments, and bestowed them upon his guests, so that in his household there was no surplus [wealth].

He received and succored well-known gentlemen. He associated with a very large number of generals, chancellors, ministers, and grandees.

hence those who occupied official positions in turn recommended him. Travelers talked about him; his empty fame flourished and spread, so that it overwhelmed that of his various uncles.

He dared to do affected deeds which created a stir and performed them without shame.

[Wang] Mang's elder brother, [Wang] Yung, had been a Department Head. He had died young and had had a son, [Wang] Kuang. [Wang] Mang sent him to study at the gates of the Erudits.

When [Wang] Mang took his leave, [usually once each five days], he led out and arranged his chariots and horsemen and brought sheep and wine to recompense and offer to [Wang Kuang's] teachers; his favor was [also] shown to all of [Wang Kuang's] fellow-students.

[Although Wang] Kuang was younger than [Wang] Mang's son, [Wang] Yü, [Wang] Mang had them [both] married on the same day. [At the wedding feast], when the guests had filled his halls.

in a moment a man told him that his Lady Dowager [mother] was suffering from a certain pain and must drink a certain medicine. Up to [the time] when the guests left, he had [thus] arisen several times.

He once privately purchased a waiting-maid. Some of his cousins came to know something about it. Because of that, [Wang] Mang said, "The General of the Rear, Chu [Po] Tzu-yüan, has no sons. I, Mang, heard that this girl's line is fruitful in bearing sons, so I purchased her for him." The same day he presented the slave-girl to [Chu Po] Tzu-yüan.

In the foregoing manner he hid his desires and sought for fame.

At this time, Shun-yü Chang, the son of an elder [half]-sister of the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], had, because of his ability, become one of the nine high ministers. He was senior to and ahead of [Wang] Mang.

[Wang] Mang secretly sought out [Shun-yü Chang's] crimes. [Wang Mang] took advantage of [this information and informed] the Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, [Wang] Ken, who had him speak [to the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. Thereupon, Shun-yü] Chang suffered execution. From this [deed, Wang] Mang obtained [a reputation] for straightforwardness. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Shun-yü] Chang."

[Wang] Ken then begged to retire and recommended [Wang] Mang to take his place. The Emperor thereupon selected him to be the Commander-in-chief.

This year was the first year of [the period] Sui-ho, and [Wang] Mang had reached his thirty-eighth year.

When [Wang] Mang had surpassed his equals and succeeded his four uncles, [Wang Feng, Wang Shang, Wang Yin, and Wang Ken], as chief assistant in the government, he wished to make his fame and reputation surpass that of his predecessors, hence he denied himself tirelessly and invited the Capable and Good [to come to him], making them Division Head Clerks. He bestowed upon [other] gentlemen all of his grants [from the Emperor] and the income from his estate, being even more economical [in his personal expenses].

When his mother was ill, the ministers and full marquises sent their Ladies to ask after her illness. When [Wang] Mang's wife received them, her clothes did not trail on the ground [and she wore] a linen apron.

Those who saw her, thought she was a servant, and sent someone to ask [who she was]. When they learned that she was the Lady, they were all astonished.

[Wang Mang] had been chief assistant in the government for more than a year when Emperor Ch'eng died. When Emperor Ai ascended the throne, he honored the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] and made her the Grand Empress Dowager.

The [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, [ordering him] to go to his residence and leave [his position vacant for some of] the Emperor's maternal relatives.

[Wang] Mang [hence] presented to the Emperor a request begging to retire. Emperor Ai [however] sent his Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [T'ang Lin], with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "The late Emperor entrusted the government to you, sir, whereupon he departed from his subjects. We have obtained [the opportunity] to uphold the [imperial] ancestral temples and will in truth consider [Ourself] fortunate to be of the same mind and similar opinions with you, sir. Now you, sir, have sent [Us a letter saying that you] are ill and ask to retire. Thereby you make known that We are not able to uphold or follow the intentions of the late Emperor. We are greatly saddened.

[We] have already issued an imperial edict to the Masters of Writing to await your memorials, sir, about [government] business."

[The Emperor] also sent the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, the Grand Minister of Works, Ho Wu, the General of the Left, Shih Tan, and the Commandant of the Palace Guard, Fu Hsi, to speak to the [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang], saying, "The Emperor has heard of the Empress Dowager's imperial edict and is much saddened.

If the Commander-in-chief [Wang Mang] does not arise, the Emperor will then not presume to attend to the government."

The [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang thereupon] again ordered [Wang] Mang to attend to the [government] business.

At that time, the grandmother of Emperor Ai, the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu of Ting-t'ao, and his mother, the Concubine nee Ting [of the deceased King of Ting-t'ao], were alive, so the Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, presented to the throne a letter saying, "According to the principles of the Spring and Autumn [in the Kung-yang Commentary], a mother becomes honorable because of her son, so that the Concubine [nee] Ting should be presented with the imperial title [of Empress Dowager]."

[Wang] Mang together with Shih Tan impeached [Tung] Hung for misleading the court, which constituted inhumanity. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Shih] Tan."

At a later date, there was a banquet in Wei-yang Palace. The Prefect of the Flunkies spread the canopy and seat for the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu at the side of the seat for the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang.

Wang] Mang investigated and reproached the Prefect of the Flunkies, saying, "The Queen Dowager of [the kingdom of] Ting-t'ao is a concubine from a tributary [kingdom]. How could she be permitted to be honored equally with the most honorable [lady in the palace]? Take it away and put the seat [of the Queen Dowager of Ting-t'ao] at a different [place]."

When the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu heard of it, she was furious and refused to attend [the banquet. She thereupon held] a great hatred against [Wang] Mang.

[Hence Wang] Mang again begged to retire. Emperor Ai granted [Wang] Mang five hundred catties of actual gold, a comfortable carriage and a quadriga of horses, dismissed him [from his position], and sent him to his residence.

Most of the ministers and grandees praised him, so the Emperor added his grace and favor, and established, as [regular] messenger to his home, a Palace [Attendant Within] the Yellow Gate to grant him a meal [from the imperial cuisine] once every ten days.

[The Emperor] sent to his subordinates an imperial edict which said, "The Marquis of Hsin-tu, [Wang] Mang, has worried and toiled for the state and has firmly held to his fealty. We hoped with him to produce a good government.

[but] the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] has issued an imperial edict that [Wang] Mang should go to his residence, for which We are very sorry.

Let [Wang Mang][80] be additionally enfeoffed with three hundred fifty households in Huang-yu Village; let his position be Specially Advanced, let him [be given the rank of] Serving in the Palace, [be required] to come to court [only] on the first and fifteenth days of the month, and present himself with formalities like those of the three highest ministers.

When [the Emperor rides] his chariot of state, [Wang Mang] may follow in the [imperial cortege] riding a green chariot.

The second year afterwards, when the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu and the Concubine [nee] Ting had both been given the imperial titles [of Emperor's Great Empress Dowager and the Emperor's Empress Dowager, respectively], the Lieutenant Chancellor Chu Po memorialized, "[Wang] Mang has not previously applied broadly [enough] the principle of honoring those [deserving of] honor but has humbled and degraded those who should be honored with an imperial title, [thereby] injuring the doctrine of filial piety, so that he ought to suffer public execution.

Fortunately [for him], he has received [the advantage of a general] ordinance of amnesty, [yet] it is not proper that he should possess a noble title or land. I beg that he be dismissed [from his titles] and made a commoner."

The Emperor said, "Because [Wang] Mang is related to the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang], let him not be dismissed [from his noble titles], but be sent away to his estate."

While [Wang] Mang had closed his gates and was keeping to himself, [Wang] Huo, his son who was neither his eldest nor his youngest, murdered a slave. [Wang] Mang bitterly reproached [Wang] Huo and caused him to commit suicide.

While he had been at his estate to the third year, officials by the hundreds sent letters to the Emperor grieving and pleading for [Wang] Mang.

In the first year of [the period] Yüan-shou, when there was an eclipse of the sun, [some persons who had been recommended as] Capable and Good, Chou Huo, Sung Ch'ung, and others, in their written replies to the examination, praised highly [Wang] Mang's achievements and virtue. The Emperor therefore summoned [Wang] Mang [to come to court].

When [Wang] Mang had first gone to his estate, because [Wang] Mang was an honorable and important [personage], the Grand Administrator of Nan-yang [Commandery] selected a Division Head from his office, K'ung Hsiu, [a man of] Yüan, to be the acting Chancellor of Hsin-tu, [Wang Mang's marquisate.

When K'ung] Hsiu went to pay a visit to [Wang] Mang, [Wang] Mang [treated K'ung Hsiu] with all possible formalities and in person welcomed him [at the door]. [K'ung] Hsiu had also heard of [Wang Mang's] fame and responded to him in like manner.

Later, when [Wang] Mang was ill, [K'ung] Hsiu attended upon him. Because of his gracious intent, [Wang] Mang presented him with his [own] precious sword having jade furnishings, desiring to make [K'ung Hsiu] a good friend.

[But K'ung] Hsiu refused to receive it. [Wang] Mang said therefore, "I verily see that on your face, sir, there is a scar. A fine jade can extinguish a scar. I merely wanted to present you with the ring on the hilt of the sword."

He immediately loosed its [jade] sword-ring. When [K'ung] Hsiu again excused himself and refused.

[Wang] Mang said, "Do you, sir, dislike [to receive it] because of its [high] value?" Then he pounded it to pieces, himself tied it up, and thereupon presented it to [K'ung] Hsiu. [K'ung] Hsiu then received it.

When [Wang] Mang was summoned [to the court and was about to] leave, he wanted to see [K'ung] Hsiu, [but K'ung] Hsiu pronounced himself ill and did not present himself.

More than a year after [Wang] Mang returned to the imperial capital, Emperor Ai died. He had no children and both the [August Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Fu] and the [Emperor's] Empress Dowager [nee] Ting had died previously. On the same day [as the death], the Grand August Empress Dowager [nee Wang] rode a quadriga to the Wei-yang Palace, where she secured the imperial seals with their seal-cords. She sent a messenger galloping to summon [Wang] Mang.

She issued an imperial edict to the Masters of Writing, [declaring] that the various insignia and credentials for mobilizing troops, the matters memorialized by the various officials, and the troops of the Palace Attendants Within the Yellow Gate and of the Attendants at the Gates should all be under the control of [Wang] Mang.

[Wang] Mang advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] that the Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Kao-an, Tung Hsien, was too young and [that his occupying that position] did not accord with public opinion, [so that she should] take [away] his [official and noble] seals and cords. On the same day, [Tung] Hsien committed suicide.

Because the Grand Minister Over the Masses, K'ung Kuang, was a famous scholar, had acted as chancellor to three lords [of men], was respected by the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and the whole empire trusted him, [Wang] Mang therefore honored [K'ung] Kuang greatly and served him. [Wang Mang] introduced [to the court K'ung] Kuang's son-in-law, Chen Han, and made him a Palace Attendant and the Chief Commandant of the Imperial Equipages.

[Wang] Mang attributed crimes to all the various maternal relatives of Emperor Ai, together with [those of] his great officials and those who held office whom [Wang] Mang had disliked, and prepared [unsigned] memorials begging [that they be punished]. He had [Chen] Han take them to [K'ung] Kuang.

[K'ung] Kuang was habitually timid and cautious, so did not dare to refuse to send in these memorials [as his own]. Each time [they were received, Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to assent to these memorials.

In this way, the General of the Van, Ho Wu, and the General of the Rear, Kung-sun Lu, were sentenced for having recommended each other and were dismissed.

The relatives of the Ting and Fu [clans], together with [those of] Tung Hsien were all dismissed from their positions and from their noble titles and were exiled to distant regions.

The Marquis of Hung-yang, [Wang] Li, was a younger [half]-brother of the [Grand] Empress Dowager. Although he did not occupy any [official] position, yet because he was one of his uncles who was respected within [the Palace, Wang Mang] dreaded him. He feared [Wang] Li might casually say something to the [Grand] Empress Dowager which would bring it about that [Wang Mang] would not be permitted to follow his own intentions. So [Wang Mang] had [K'ung] Kuang also memorialize [Wang] Li's former evil deeds.

that he had previously known that the Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yü Chang, had committed the crime of rebellion and he had [nevertheless] received from him a large bribe and had falsely spoken for him, [thus] misleading the court.

Later he had advised that a secret son of a government woman, Yang Chi, [allegedly by Emperor Ch'eng], should be made an Imperial Son, [a possible heir to the throne. But] the common opinion [in the court was, "It is a case of] the reappearance of the Young Emperor of the Lü clan. It is most disturbing. It would be suspicious to the empire, so that it would be difficult to establish [such a babe's legitimacy] to later generations or to achieve anything creditable in behalf of [such a babe] in swaddling clothes."

[The memorial] begged that [Wang] Li should be sent back to his state.

When the [Grand] Empress Dowager would not listen to it, [Wang] Mang said to her, "Now the Han dynasty has decayed and has been without [natural] heirs [to the throne] for successive generations. You alone, [Grand] Empress Dowager, can take the place of the young lord in directing the government. It is sincerely to be dreaded that, even if you strive hard to use justice and uprightness in leading the empire, it is yet to be feared that [the empire] will not follow [you. But] now if for the sake of your private affection you go contrary to the advice of your highest officials, in this way your many subordinates will become dangerous and evil; disorder will arise because of this [event].

It is proper to approve [this petition], temporarily send [Wang Li] to his state, and, after the situation has become more tranquil, to summon him back."

The [Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative, so sent [Wang] Li to his state.

The [methods] by which [Wang] Mang compelled and controlled his superiors and inferiors were all of the foregoing sort.

In this way, those who attached themselves to him and accorded with him were promoted and those who opposed or disliked him were exterminated.

Wang Shun and Wang Yi became his intimate advisers. Chen Feng and Chen Han had charge of making decisions, P'ing Yen had charge of delicate matters, Liu Hsin took care of [classical] literature, Sun Chien was his military assistant.

[Chen] Feng's son, [Chen] Hsün, [Liu] Hsin's son, [Liu] Fen, Ts'ui Fa from Cho Commandery, and Ch'en Ch'ung from Nan-yang [Commandery] were all favored by [Wang] Mang because of their ability.

[Wang] Mang's appearance was severe and his speech was blunt. When he wanted to have something done, he subtly indicated it in his bearing; his clique took up his intentions and manifested them in a memorial, [whereupon Wang] Mang bent his head to the earth with tears in his eyes, and firmly declined. On the one hand, he thereby misled the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and on the other, he thereby exhibited faithfulness to the mass of commoners.

First, he had hinted that [the Governor of] Yi Province should induce the barbarians outside the barrier to present a white pheasant, and, in the first year of [the period] Yüan-shih, in the first month, [Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict that the white pheasant should be offered in the [imperial] ancestral temples.

The many courtiers therefore memorialized, saying, "The [Grand] Empress Dowager entrusted to the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, the duty of planning the imperial enthronement that gave peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples.

When the former Commander-in-chief Ho Kuang had the merit of [similarly] having given peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples, his enfeoffment was increased by thirty thousand households, the noble title and estate [of his posterity was ordered] to be the same [as that of the founder of their house, and he was ranked] the same as the [former] Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho].

It would be proper for [Wang] Mang to be [treated] as [Ho] Kuang was formerly [treated]."

The [Grand] Empress Dowager questioned the ministers, saying, "Is it really that, because the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, has achieved great merit, he ought to be given [high] honors? Or is it because he is of [Our] flesh and blood that you have wanted to distinguish him?"

Thereupon various courtiers produced long expositions, [saying, "Wang] Mang's achievements and virtuous conduct have brought about the auspicious presage of a white pheasant [as at the time the Duke of] Chou [was minister to King] Ch'eng. That in a thousand years there are similarities is a law of the sage-kings.

When a subject has great achievements, in his lifetime he should have a laudable title. Hence the Duke of Chou, during his lifetime, was given a title with [the name of] the Chou [dynasty in it.

[Wang] Mang has the great achievement of having given stability to the state and of having given tranquillity to the Han dynasty, so that it is proper that he should be granted the title, `The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty],' that the [number of] households [in his noble estate] should be increased, and [his posterity should be given] the same noble title and estate [as the founder of their house]. On the one hand, [this appointment] will be in accordance with ancient principles, and on the other hand, it will take as its model past situations. Thereby it will accord with the mind of Heaven."

When the [Grand] Empress Dowager, in an imperial edict, ordered a Master of Writing to prepare [an edict for] this matter.

[Wang] Mang presented a letter which said, "Your servant planned the enthronement [of Emperor P'ing] together with K'ung Kuang, Wang Shun, Chen Feng, and Chen Han. Now I wish that the achievements and rewards of [K'ung] Kuang and the others should alone be listed and that [any rewards for] your servant, Mang, should be abandoned and set aside. Do not list me with them."

Chen Han advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, which said, "`Without deflection and without partiality, Great is the way of [true] Kings.'

Although a relative should be loved, [yet We] should not be partial to him. [But] you, sir, have achieved the merit of having given tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [We] cannot set aside [your merits] and not exalt them just because you are of [Our] flesh and blood.

You, sir, must not refuse."

When [Wang] Mang again presented a letter excusing himself.

the [Grand] Empress Dowager by an imperial edict ordered an Internuncio to lead [Wang] Mang to await [investiture] in the Eastern Wing of the [Palace] Hall. [But Wang] Mang pronounced himself ill and would not enter [the Palace Hall.

so the Grand] Empress Dowager sent the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [Yao] Hsün, with an imperial edict to [Wang Mang], saying, "Because you, sir, are humble, you have refused on account of illness. Your position, sir, is important, and may not be left vacant. Arise promptly at this time."

When [Wang] Mang completely and firmly refused.

the [Grand] Empress Dowager again sent the Grand Coachman at the Ch'ang-hsin [Palace, Wang] Hung, with an imperial decree summoning [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang [however] insistently pronounced himself ill.

Her entourage advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager that it was proper not to force [Wang] Mang's will, and merely to list K'ung Kuang and the others, whereupon [Wang] Mang would be willing to arise.

The [Grand] Empress Dowager [thereupon] issued to her subordinates an imperial edict, saying, "The Grand Tutor, the Marquis of Po-shan, [K'ung] Kuang, has guarded [the throne] for four reigns and from reign to reign has been tutor or chancellor. He is loyal, filial, benevolent, and sincere; his conduct and his fealty have been outstanding. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [K'ung] Kuang shall become the Grand Master, participating in a government by Four Coadjutors.

"The General of Chariots and Cavalry, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun, has repeatedly and continually been benevolent and filial; he was sent to invite the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Chi-tzu, to ascend the throne] and he has `repulsed [by diplomacy] the attacks of [the enemy at a distance of] ten thousand li.' His achievements and virtuous conduct are abundant and brilliant. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [Wang] Shun shall become the Grand Guardian.

"The General of the Left and Superintendent of the Imperial Household, [Chen] Feng, has guarded [the throne] for three reigns. He is loyal, trustworthy, benevolent, and sincere. He was sent to invite the King of Chung-shan [to ascend the throne] and has assisted and guided him and supplied his needs, thereby giving tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [Chen] Feng shall be enfeoffed as Marquis of Kuang-yang with the income of a state of 5000 households. [Chen] Feng shall become the Junior Tutor.

"Upon all [these persons] there shall be conferred the position [of being included among] the Four Coadjutors. Their noble ranks and estates shall be the same [for their descendants as for the founders of their houses] and to each shall be given one residence.

"The Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Imperial Equipages, [Chen] Han, has guarded the throne and toiled diligently. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. [Chen] Han shall be enfeoffed as the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang with the income of an estate of two thousand four hundred households."

When these four persons had received rewards and [Wang] Mang had not even yet arisen, various courtiers again presented [a memorial to the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], saying, "Although [Wang] Mang is able to yield [to others, yet] he is one whom the court should properly make illustrious and to whom should be given at [this appropriate] time [suitable] rewards, [thereby] making well-known and important one who has achieved great merits and [thereby] not causing the hopes of the many officials or of the great multitude to be disappointed."

The [Grand] Empress Dowager thereupon issued an imperial edict, saying, "The Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Hsin-tu, [Wang] Mang, has been one of the three highest ministers for three reigns and has performed the [same] duties [as those performed by] the Duke of Chou. He has established the plan [for the succession to the throne that is to endure for] ten thousand generations. In achievements and virtuous conduct he has been a model to palace officials. His influence has spread over [all] within the [four] seas, so that people of distant [regions] have thought with affection of right principles; a potentate of the Yüeh-shang, [whose speech must be] repeatedly interpreted [from one interpreter to another], presented a white pheasant as tribute.

"Let [Wang] Mang be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] the twenty-eight thousand households in the two counties of Shao-ling and Hsin-hsi. His heirs who succeed him shall be exempted [from taxes and service] and their noble rank and estate shall be the same [as his]. His achievements shall be [ranked] the same as those of the [former] Chancellor of State, Hsiao [Ho.

The first residence, that of the former Chancellor of State, Hsiao [Ho], shall become the residence of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. Let [this ordinance] be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance and be transmitted [forever] without end."

Thereupon [Wang] Mang hypocritically feared that he had no alternative and so he arose and received his charter [of appointment].

The charter said, "The Han [dynasty] was in danger because there was no heir, and your excellency stabilized it. As to the positions of the Four Coadjutors and the responsibilities of the three highest ministers, your excellency controls them.

As to the various officials and the many positions, your excellency rules them.

Your merits and virtue are abundant and brilliant. Thereby the [imperial] ancestral temples are tranquil. Verily, the auspicious presage of the white pheasant is symbolical of [the way the Duke of] Chou [acted as minister to King] Ch'eng.

Hence [We] grant you the auspicious title of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. When you are the Coadjutor and protector of the Emperor, do you aim at bringing about [a condition of the utmost] tranquillity. Do not disappoint Our intentions."

[Wang] Mang received the titles of Grand Tutor and Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [but] he yielded up and returned the matter of his increase in enfeoffment and his noble rank and estate being the same [for his descendants as for himself], saying, "I wish to wait until the people have a sufficiency in their households and then only should I be given any rewards."

The other highest ministers again argued with him. The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "You, Duke, of your own accord aim at the people having a sufficiency in their households, because of which [We] listen to you.

Let it be ordered that your salary, Duke, and the rewards granted to the members of your suite shall all be double what they were previously.

and when the people have a sufficiency in their households so that personally they have enough, the Grand Minister over the Multitude, [K'ung] Kuang, and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Ch'ung], shall report [the fact] in order that [you may thereupon be granted the full amount of your reward]."

[Wang] Mang again refused and would not receive [these honors] and proposed that it would be proper to set up descendants of the vassal kings [as kings] and to enfeoff the descendants of the more important of the meritorious courtiers of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and his successors, as marquises or to grant them the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain with the income of estates; and thereafter those in office should each have his [full] rank, [so that there may be] a government making grants to every one, in which on the one hand, the [imperial] ancestral temples are honored by augmenting the rites and music [employed therein] and on the other hand, gentlemen and commoners are shown kindness and widowers and widows [are given] grace and bounty.

A discussion is in the "Annals of [Emperor Hsiao]-p'ing."

When [Wang] Mang had pleased the mass of commoners, he also wanted the right to decide matters on his own authority.

He knew that the [Grand] Empress Dowager had no taste for governing, so he gave a hint to the ministers. They memorialized her, saying, "In the past, officials have been promoted in accordance with the order of their merits to [positions ranking as] two thousand piculs. They, together with minor officials who have been recommended from the provincial divisions as being Abundant Talents of Unusual Degree, are for the most part not worthy [of their positions, so that] it would be proper that they should all interview the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang].

It is also not proper that the [Grand] Empress Dowager should in person supervise unimportant matters."

[Thus they] caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Since the Emperor is young in years, We are temporarily directing the government until he puts on the bonnet of virility.

Now most matters are complicated and detailed, while Our years are many and [Our] bodily vigor is insufficient. [If We attend to these matters], there is danger that [We] may not have the means of keeping [Our] body in health or of caring for the Emperor.

Hence [We] have selected loyal and capable persons and have set up the Four Coadjutors, so that [Our] many inferiors should be urged to do their duty and there should perpetually be prosperity and peace.

"Confucius `said, "How sublime the way Shun and Yü held possession of the country and yet remained indifferent to [the details of government]!" '

From this time and henceforth, except for enfeoffments of noble titles, which shall nevertheless be reported [to Us], in all other matters, the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty and the Four Coadjutors shall judge and decide.

As to Provincial Shepherds, [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs, together with minor officials [who are recommended as being] Abundant Talents, when they are [considered] for their first appointment [to office] and when they memorialize matters, they shall each time be led into an office near [the palace] to answer questions; the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], shall examine into their former offices and ask about their new duties, in order that he may know whether they are worthy or not."

Thereupon [Wang] Mang received and questioned each one [of the officials], conveyed to them his secret gracious intentions, and bestowed upon them rich parting gifts, while he brought out memorials concerning those who did not suit his purposes and dismissed them, so that his power was equal to that of the lord of men.

[Wang] Mang wanted to delight the [Grand] Empress Dowager with vain reputation, so advised her in conversation that since she had herself succeeded to the extravagance of the Ting and Fu [clans related to] the deceased [Emperor] Hsiao-ai, while most of the people did not have enough [to live on], it would be proper for the [Grand] Empress Dowager temporarily to wear coarse plain silk, and to reduce considerably [the expense of] her cuisine, in order to show [her economical spirit] to the empire.

[Wang] Mang thereupon presented a letter, stating that he would pay a million cash and offer thirty ch'ing of cultivated fields, to be paid to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, for assistance and gifts to the poor people.

Thereupon the ministers all admired and imitated him.

[Wang] Mang led the various courtiers in a memorial, saying, "Your Majesty is of an honorable age, [yet] you have for a long time worn heavy plain white silk and have reduced your imperial cuisine, which verily is not the way to sustain your bodily vigor, to care for the Emperor, or to give tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples.

Your servant Mang has several times knocked his head to the ground at the door to your Inner Apartments and has advised and argued with you [concerning this practise, but my request that this practise be discontinued] has not yet been approved.

Now, thanks to your Majesty's virtue and beneficence, the wind and rain have recently been timely, sweet dew has descended, the supernatural fungus of immortality has grown, the calendar plant and the red herb, auspicious cereals and [other] favorable signs have all appeared simultaneously.

Your servant Mang and the others are not capable of overcoming their great hopes: we wish that your Majesty would have compassion upon your energy, rest your spirit, relax your thoughts, conform to the regular imperial robes, and restore the legal cuisine of the Grand Provisioner, thereby causing each of your subjects and children to be completely content in his heart and to supply your needs perfectly.

We hope that you will sympathetically scrutinize [our request]."

[Wang] Mang also caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily, [We] have heard that [according to] the moral principles for the mother of a ruler, her thoughts should not go outside the threshold of the door.

Since the state has not received [Heaven's] blessing and the Emperor is of the age when he is in swaddling-clothes and is not yet capable of governing in person, [We] have trembled with apprehension and [guarded Ourself] for fear that the [imperial] ancestral temples would not be tranquil.

Except for Us, who can control the general policies of the state?

"It was for such reasons that Confucius interviewed Nan-tzu and that the Duke of Chou acted as regent, which was probably an expedient suited to the time.

[We] have fatigued [Ourself] and have pondered to the utmost [degree], have toiled and worried, and have not yet become tranquil. Hence `if the state is prodigal, then [a sage] gives it an example of economy,' and `in straightening a curved [piece of wood, it may be spoiled by being bent backwards] beyond a straight [line,' so We may have gone too far in economizing], yet if We do not personally lead [the empire back to correctness], what will [We be able] to say to the empire?

[We] have hoped morning and night that the five [kinds of] grains should be harvested in abundance and the peoples' households should have a sufficiency. When the Emperor dons the cap of virility, [We] shall entrust the government to him and transfer it to him.

[We] now verily have had no leisure for light and delicate [clothing] or for perfectly flavored [food] and hope that together with the many officials [We] may achieve [a good government]. Let [us all] make [great] efforts towards this [end]."

Every time there was a flood or drought, [Wang] Mang would eat plain food. When her entourage advised her of it,

the [Grand] Empress Dowager sent a messenger with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "[We] have heard that you, Duke, have been eating [only] vegetables. Your solicitude for the common people is indeed deep.

Since in this autumn there has fortunately been a good harvest, and you, Duke, are so diligent in your duties, at this time you should eat meat and care for your body for the sake of the state."

[Wang] Mang pondered that the Middle States were already tranquil, and only the barbarians of the four [quarters] were still the same as [before]. So he sent an envoy to give actual gold and valuable silks, as heavy bribes, to the Hun Shan-yü, in order to have him send a letter to the Emperor, which said, "I have heard that in the Middle States a double personal name is criticized. My former personal name has been Nang-chih-ya-szu. Now I change my personal name to Chih, in admiration of and conformity to the regulations of the sages."

He also sent [Lüan-ti Yün], the Hun Princess [who had married] Hsü-pu [Tang] and who was the daughter of Wang [Ch'iang] Chao-chün, to enter [the court] and wait upon [the Grand Empress Dowager.

[Wang Mang thus used] myriads of methods and stratagems to dazzle deceptively and serve flatteringly the [Grand] Empress Dowager and her inferiors down to her Chief Chamberlain who was at her side.

[Wang] Mang had become an important personage, he wanted to mate his daughter to the Emperor, making her the Empress, in order to make his power secure. [So] he memorialized, saying, "The Emperor has been on the throne to the third year, [yet the occupant of] the Ch'ang-ch'iu Palace, [the Empress], has not yet been established and [the positions of] concubines in the Lateral Courts have not yet been filled.

Anciently, the difficulties of the dynasty have originated from heirs being lacking and from [imperial] marriages and takings [of concubines] having been incorrect.

I beg that the Five Classics be investigated and discussed in order to establish rites for [the imperial] marriage and to fix the principle of [the Emperor's] twelve women, in order to increase his posterity.

and a wide selection [for his harem] from the daughters of the principal wives of the descendants from the two [immediately preceding dynasties of true] kings, [the Shang and Chou dynasties], the posterity of the Duke of Chou and of Confucius, and the marquises in Ch'ang-an.

The matter was referred to the high officials and they presented [to the Grand Empress Dowager] the names of a multitude of girls. The girls of the Wang clan were the most numerous of those selected [as candidates for becoming the Empress.

Wang Mang feared that they would compete with his own daughter, so he immediately presented [a letter] saying,"I personally am without virtue and my child's abilities are of a low [order], so that it would not be proper for her to be put with the multitude of girls [from whom the Empress] is to be chosen."

The [Grand] Empress Dowager thought that he was completely sincere, so issued an imperial edict [for the Emperor], saying, "The girls of the Wang clan are Our maternal relatives. Let them not be selected [for the imperial harem]."

The many common people, the [Confucian] masters, the Gentlemen, the lower officials, and [those holding] higher positions, who [thereupon came to] wait at the [Palace] Portals to present letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager, numbered] more than a thousand daily; some of the ministers and grandees went to the middle of the [principal] court and some prostrated themselves outside the doors of the Inner [Apartments]. All said,

"The sage virtue of your enlightened edict is as sublime as" that, [or] "The abundant and glorious services of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty are as magnificent as" this, [or], "Now that an Empress is to be established, why should the daughter of the Duke be specially excluded? Where would the destiny of the empire be [better] placed? We wish to secure the daughter of the Duke as the mother of the empire."

[Wang] Mang sent his Chief Clerk and subordinates by divisions to instruct and stop the ministers and the [Confucian] masters, but those who presented letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager] were even greater [in number than before,

so the Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative but to listen to the ministers and select the daughter of Wang] Mang [to be the Empress].

[When Wang] Mang again himself advised her that it would be proper to select widely from among the host of [suitable] girls,

the ministers contested with him, saying, "It is not proper to select other girls and thereby alter the proper line of succession, [which can only come through the daughter of the Duke]."

[Wang] Mang [accordingly] advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] that he was willing to have his daughter interviewed.

The [Grand] Empress Dowager sent the Privy Treasurer of Ch'ang-lo [Palace, Hsia-hou Fan], the Superintendent of the Imperial House, [Liu Hung], and the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [P'ing Yen], to present the proposal [of marriage] and to interview the girl. They returned and memorialized, saying,

"The daughter of the Duke has been imbued with virtue and culture and has a beautiful and fascinating appearance, so that it would be proper for her to continue the heavenly succession and uphold the [imperial] sacrifices."

There was an imperial edict sending the Grand Master Over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen Feng], to inform in an official document [the imperial ancestors in the imperial] ancestral temples and in various ways to perform divination by the tortoise-shell and by the stalks. They reported unanimously,

"The cracks upon the tortoise-shell which occurred were [a prognostic] that metal and water will flourish and assist. The diagram formed by the stalks which occurred was that the father and mother will occupy [their due] positions, which may be said to be a response [presaging] prosperity and security, a portent of great good fortune."

The Marquis of Hsin-hsiang, [Liu] T'ung, presented [to the throne a memorial], saying, "[According to] the Spring and Autumn, when the Son of Heaven was about to take [a bride from the state of] Chi, he rewarded the Viscount of Chi with the title of Marquis. The estate of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], is not yet conformable to [this] ancient regulation."

The matter was referred to the high officials, and all advised, "Anciently, the Son of Heaven enfeoffed the father of his Empress [with a fief] a hundred li [square]; he honored [his father-in-law] and did not treat him as his subject, in order to give importance to his ancestral temple. It was the extreme of filial piety.

[Liu] T'ung's advice is in conformity with the rites and may be approved. We beg that [Wang] Mang be additionally enfeoffed with the 25,600 ch'ing of cultivated fields in [the county of] Hsin-yeh, [in order that he may have] a full hundred li."

[Wang] Mang excused himself, saying, "Your subject Mang's daughter is really not fit to be mated to the most honorable person [i.e., the Emperor]. I furthermore have heard about the discussions of the many [officials concerning] an increase in my enfeoffment.

I, your subject Mang, myself humbly meditate that I have been permitted to rely upon [the fact that I am] a distant relative [of the throne] and have [thus] attained noble rank and lands. If my daughter is really capable of supporting and according with your sage virtue, the estate of your subject Mang is [yet] sufficient to make offerings for the tribute at the court; it is not necessary again to give me the favor of added territory.

I wish to return what was to be added." The [Grand] Empress Dowager approved it.

The high officials memorialized that, [according to] ancient practises, an empress was betrothed [with a gift of] twenty thousand catties of actual gold, which would be two hundred million cash.

[Wang] Mang declined it and asked strongly that it be given to others, [but] received forty million [cash] and gave thirty-three million [cash] of that [sum] to the families of [the Emperor's] eleven concubines, [who were to accompany the Empress].

Various courtiers again said, "Now the betrothal presents received for the Empress barely surpass those for the various concubines."

[So] there was an imperial edict again increasing [the gift to Wang Mang] by twenty-three million [cash, making it] altogether thirty million [cash.

Wang] Mang again used ten million [cash] of that [sum] to divide among the poor persons in his nine [sets of] relatives.

Ch'en Ch'ung was at that time Director of Justice to the Grand Minister over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and was good friends with Chang Ch'ang's grandson, [Chang] Sung.

[Chang] Sung was a gentlemen of wide learning, and drafted for [Ch'en] Ch'ung a memorial praising the achievements and virtuous conduct of [Wang] Mang, which [Ch'en] Ch'ung memorialized. It said,

"[According to] the opinion of your unworthy servant, from the time that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty first `brought his bundle of dried flesh [and began studying],' he has been placed in an age when customs have been highly extravagant and luxurious, has had the high favor of being allied in flesh and blood to [the occupants of] two palaces, [Emperor Ch'eng and the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], and has been covered with the illustrious brilliance of his various uncles. His wealth has been great and his power abundant, so that his will was unopposed.

Yet he has humbled himself, lived a life of kindness and goodness, vanquished his desires, and walked in the path of proper conduct, resisting the age and correcting its customs, standing firmly alone,

[wearing] poor clothes and [eating] poor food, with a shabby carriage and sorry horses, with one consort and no other [woman]. No one of the multitude has failed to hear of [the wonderful conditions] within the doors of his inner apartments and of his virtues of filial piety and friendliness.

He is quiescent, rejoicing in the Way, gentle and good, and associating with worthy inferiors. He is kindly to his old friends and servitors and faithful to his teachers and associates.

Confucius said, `No [one] is as good as the man who is poor and yet happy, rich and yet loves the rules of proper conduct,' which indeed applies to the Duke."

"When he was a Palace Attendant and the former Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yü Chang, committed the crime of treason, the Duke did not presume to keep it to himself [but] advocated that [his cousin] should be punished.

The Duke of Chou executed [the King's Uncles] of Kuan and of Ts'ai and Master Chi [Yu] poisoned Shu Ya, which [precedent] indeed denotes that the Duke [is like these sages]."

"For this reason, Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng gave the Duke a mandate to be his Commander-in-chief, entrusting him with the government of the state."

"When [Emperor] Hsiao-ai ascended the throne, while the proud concubine, [the Queen Dowager nee Fu] watched him furtively [for a chance] to work her will and while his wicked courtiers hatched rebellion, you, Duke, yourself impeached the Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, and [at an imperial banquet] changed and corrected the usurped seat of the now deceased [Queen Dowager nee Fu], the mother of King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang]."

"From that time on, when the officials of the court discussed [matters], no one failed to accord with the Classics."

"He took leave of his position on account of illness and returned to his great house, where he was endangered by brigand-like officials."

"After he had gone to his estate, Emperor Hsiao-ai awakened [to a comprehension of his error] and again returned you, Duke, to Ch'ang-an. When he became ill and [his illness] became increasingly severe, he still did not forget you, Duke, and again especially advanced your rank."

"That night, in [a time of] haste and confusion, the state was without a presumptive heir and wicked courtiers filled the court, so that the peril was indeed great."

"We reflected that no one was more fitting than you, Duke, [to make] a plan for giving tranquillity to the state, [so We] had you inducted into the court. That same day [We] dismissed the Marquis of Kao-an, Tung Hsien, and within the interval of a turn of the clepsydra, your loyal plans were immediately established and the main and subordinate [dynastic] principles were all set forth in detail."

"[During the year-periods] Sui-ho and Yüan-shou, when you twice happened upon the death of an emperor, you carried out all things perfectly, so that civil disturbances did not take place."

"You have assisted Us to the fifth year, [during which time] you have corrected fundamental matters of human relationships and have fixed the altars of Heaven and Earth."

"You have carefully served the gods in heaven and earth and have disposed of [matters in all] the four seasons. You have restored what had been abolished for a thousand years and straightened out the mistakes of a hundred generations. [People from all over] the empire have met in harmony and a great crowd has collected together."

"The Spiritual Tower [spoken of] in the Book of Odes, the building of [the city of] Lo in the Book of History, the institutes of the capital at Hao and the regulations of the Shang [dynasty's] capital have been revived by you in the present [age]."

"You have made glorious and illustrious the supreme achievements of the deceased deified rulers and have made brilliant and manifest the `excellent virtue' of the founder and exemplars [of the imperial line]. You have exalted and made apparent the principle that respect for the father [of a dynasty] consists in [making him] the coadjutor of Heaven. You have restored and established the rites for the suburban sacrifice to the most prominent ancestor of the line anterior to the founder of the house (chiao), the sacrifice to the most ancient ancestor of the line (ti), and for the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar of the house (tsung), in order to make glorious the great [principle of] filial piety."

"For this reason [all within] the four seas are concordant, all countries incline towards correct principles, and the barbarians, who have different customs [from the Chinese], have of their own accord come [to the imperial court] without being summoned and are gradually progressing [in civilization] and have corrected their ceremonial bonnets and bring their treasures to assist at the [imperial] sacrifices."

"You have searched for old [precedents and have based [yourself] on the [correct] Way [of action], you have obeyed the [Confucian] canons and honored ancient [practices, so that] whenever you acted, you have been successful, and in everything you have attained the mean."

"Your extreme virtue and essential principles have become known to the gods; the imperial ancestors have esteemed you and rejoiced,"

"so that lights have shone brightly and happy portents from Heaven have arrived repeatedly. The grand [cosmological] principles are universally concordant [and there have been]."

"more than seven hundred auspicious presages of unicorns, phoenixes, tortoises, and dragons."

"You are accordingly instituting rites and composing music, so that you will have the great merit of having restored peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples and the [imperial] gods of the soils and grains."

"All [persons] under Heaven rely upon you alone, Duke. Your office is that of Ruling Governor and your rank is in the highest class of the highest ministers."

"[We] now add [to your honors] the distinctions for the nine conferments. Let them be used in assisting at the [imperial] sacrifices and in performing your civil and military duties. [Their favor] shall moreover be conferred upon your [deceased] ancestors."

"Oh! How can that fail to be good!"

"Thereupon [Wang] Mang bent his head to the ground, and, bowing repeatedly, received [1] a green apron, a tunic embroidered with dragons and other figures and a mortar-board hat, a short tunic and robe, a fine gold mouth for a scabbard and a fine gold tip for a scabbard, and ornamented shoes, [2] a princely chariot with bells and a quadriga of horses, with the dragon banner with nine tails and the spotted deerskin cap and white silk pleated robe, a war-chariot with a quadriga of horses, [3] a red bow and arrows and a black bow and arrows, [4 a] vermillion axe of authority to be held on his left and a metal (copper) battle-axe to be held on his right, one set of armor and a helmet, [5] two flagons of black millet herb-flavored liquor and two jade tablet spoons, [6] two green jade tablets for the nine con ferments, [7] vermillion doors, [8] inside staircases, and [9] the insignia of having an Office of [Superintendancy over] his Clan, an Office of Praying, an Office of Augury, an Office of Recording, three hundred men of [the Gentlemen] as Rapid as Tigers, one Household Steward and one Assistant [Household Steward]."

"In each of the Offices over his Clan, of Praying, of Divination, and of Recording there were established Bailiffs and Accessory [Officials]. When the Duke Giving Tranquility to the Han Dynasty was in his yamen inside [the Palace] or in his residence outside [the Palace, the Gentlemen] as Rapid as Tigers were to act as the guard at his gates, and those who were qualified to come out or in were to have their names inscribed on a register [at his gates]."

"From the Four Coadjutors and the three highest ministers [on down, if anyone] had business at his yamen or residence, they were all to use passports."

"With the Erh-ya, [books on] astronomy, divinations and revelations, the musical tubes, the "Ordinances for the Months," military methods, the written characters in Shih [Chou's] Fascicles, and who were versed in and understood their meaning."

"All went to the [office of the Major in Charge of] Official Carriages, [so that Wang Mang] ensnared and collected [all] the gentlemen of uncommon ability in the empire."

"Those who came, at former and later [times], were numbered by the thousands. All were ordered to write out their explanations [of the Classics] in his courts, with the intention of making them correct their discrepancies and errors and unify differing explanations."

"Various courtiers memorialized, saying, "Anciently, when the Duke of Chou upheld the heir who succeeded his father, although he possessed the honor of being in the highest rank of the highest ministers, yet only in the seventh year were the institutions fixed."

"Verily, the Ming-t'ang and Pi-yung have fallen into ruins and have been abolished for a thousand years and no one has been able to revive them. Now the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty has arisen from a great family and has assisted and protected your Majesty for four years down to the present. His achievements and virtuous conduct are brilliant."

"The Duke, in the eighth month, when the moon began to wax, on [the day] keng-tzu, received the message [authorizing him to] employ [people] for the purposes of the court, and he himself attended to the required service and the work of construction."

"And on the next day, [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the various masters and common people assembled in great harmony; a great crowd of a hundred thousand [persons] joined together, working with vigor for twenty [days], when the great work was all completed."

"When T'ang [Yao] and Yü [Shun] did [great] things or when at Ch'eng-chou [the Duke of Chou] founded the dynasty's [capital], they verily did no better."

"It is proper that the rank of the Ruling Governor should be above that of the vassal kings, that he should be granted bundles of silk to which are affixed jade circlets, one chariot of state [like that for] a large kingdom, one comfortable carriage, and two quadrigae of black horses." The imperial edict said, "It is approved. Let rules for the nine distinctions be discussed."

"In the winter, a great wind blew off almost all the roof-tiles on [the buildings at] the eastern gates of the city wall of Ch'ang-an."

"In the fifth year, in the first month, the hsia ancestral sacrifice to all the ancestors together was performed in the Ming-t'ang; twenty-eight vassal kings, one hundred twenty full marquises, and more than nine hundred scions of the imperial house were summoned to assist in the sacrifices. After the rites were ended, thirty-six great-grandsons of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsüan, [Liu] Hsin and others, were enfeoffed as full marquises. The other [persons who assisted in the sacrifices] all had households added [to their estates] or were granted noble ranks and rewards of money and silk, to each a definite amount."

"Since [in the empire, Wang] Mang had brought about [the condition of] complete tranquillity, in that to the north he had influenced the Huns, to the east he had caused [people] to come [from] beyond the ocean, and to the south he had attracted the Huang-chih, [but] only in the western quarter he had not yet produced [any effects],"

"he therefore sent a General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, P'ing Hsien, and others, bearing much money and silk, to tempt the Ch'iang outside the barriers and have them present their territory [to the throne and to express] a desire to be received by and to be subordinate [to Chinese rule."

"Upon his return, P'ing] Hsien and the others memorialized, saying, "The leaders of the Ch'iang tribes, Liang Yüan, and others, whose number might be twelve thousand persons, wish to be received and to be your subjects. They offer the Hsien-shui Sea, the Yün Gorge, and the Salt Lake. The level land with fine grass is all given to the Chinese people, and [the Ch'iang] will themselves dwell in the narrow and difficult places and act as guards at the frontiers."

"When I asked Liang Yüan the reason for his submitting, he replied, saying, `The Grand Empress Dowager is sage and glorious, the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty is most benevolent, and the world is completely peaceful, so that the five [kinds of] cereals ripen and there are good harvests. Some stalks of grain are ten feet or more tall, sometimes one spikelet has three kernels, sometimes, without being sown, [grain] springs up of itself, sometimes [silk] cocoons form themselves without any worms having been fed, sweet dew comes down from Heaven and wine springs come out of the earth, "male and female phoenixes have come and arrived," supernatural birds have descended and perched, so that for the [last] four years the Ch'iang people have had nothing to suffer [from the government]. Hence "oh! how pleasant" to be admitted [to the Chinese empire] and to become your subordinates.'

"It would be proper at this time to settle them in [stationary] occupations and to establish a [Chief Commandant] of a Dependent State to direct and protect them."

"The matter was referred to [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang memorialized in reply, saying, "You, [Grand] Empress Dowager, have controlled the rule for several years; your grace and bounty have inundated and overflowed, so that a filial attitude of submission [has spread over] the four quarters and not even the most distant regions with different customs have failed to turn towards correct principles."

"A Yüeh-shang potentate, [whose speech must be] successively interpreted, presented a white pheasant; the Huang-chih [came] from [a distance of] thirty thousand li to offer a live rhinoceros as tribute; kings of the Eastern Barbarians crossed the Great Ocean to offer the treasures of their states; the Hun Shan-yü conformed to [Confucian] institutions and did away with his double personal name. Now at the western boundary, Liang Yüan and the others in turn present their land and [desire to] become your menials. Anciently T'ang Yao's [virtue] `filled and covered [all within] the four extremities of the empire,' but it could not surpass your [virtue]."

"Now I have carefully examined that there are already a Tung-hai (Eastern Sea), a Nan-hai (Southern Sea), and a Po-hai (Northern Sea) Commandery, [but] there is not yet a Hsi-hai (Western Sea) Commandery. I beg that you will accept the territory which Liang Yüan and the others are offering and make it the commandery of Hsi-hai."

"Your servant has also heard that when the Sage-kings gave order to the ornaments of Heaven, [the stars], and fixed the principles of geographical [arrangements], they took the mountains, streams, and customs of the common people as the principles for the boundaries of their provinces."

"The territory of the Han dynasty is broader than that of the two [sage-]lords and three [dynasties of] kings, having altogether thirteen provinces. Many of the names of the provinces together with their boundaries do not correspond to those in the Classics."

"The `Canon of Yao' [speaks of] twelve provinces; later they were fixed at nine provinces."

"The vast territory of the Han dynasty is far-extending. When the Provincial Shepherds go to inspect their divisions, the most distant ones are more than thirty thousand li [away], so that there cannot be [only] nine [provinces]."

"I would respectfully employ the ideas of the Classics in correcting the names of the twelve provinces and make boundaries for them to correspond to the correct original [boundaries]." The memorial was approved.

"Thousands of offenders were transported to Hsi-hai [Commandery]. Those who were transported were counted by the thousands and ten-thousands, so that the common people for the first [time] held grudges [against Wang Mang]."

"The Marquis of Ch'üan-ling, Liu Ch'ing, sent to the imperial court a letter saying, "When King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor, he was called the Young Prince, and the Duke of Chou acted as Regent. Now that the Emperor is rich in youthfulness, it would be proper to order the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to perform the duties of the Son of Heaven like the Duke of Chou." The various courtiers all said, "it would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Ch'ing has said."

"The Marquis of Ch'üan-ling, Liu Ch'ing, sent to the imperial court a letter saying, "When King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor, he was called the Young Prince, and the Duke of Chou acted as Regent. Now that the Emperor is rich in youthfulness, it would be proper to order the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to perform the duties of the Son of Heaven like the Duke of Chou."

"The various courtiers all said, "it would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Ch'ing has said."

"In the winter, when [the planet] Mars was occulted by the moon, Emperor P'ing became ill."

"[Wang] Mang made a written declaration [to Heaven] in which he begged for [the Emperor's] life at the altar to the Supreme [One]. He had a jade circlet hung on his person, carried jade insignia, and [declared] that he was willing in person to take the place [of the dying Emperor]."

"The declaration was stored in a "metal-bound coffer" and placed in the Front Hall [of the Palace]. He ordered the various highest ministers not to presume to speak [to him about government business, in order that he might concentrate on caring for the Emperor's illness]."

"In the twelfth month, Emperor P'ing died. A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire."

"[Wang] Mang summoned those who understood the rites, Tsung-po Feng and others. With them, [Wang Mang] determined that the officials of the empire [ranking at] six hundred piculs and above should all wear mourning to the third year."

"[Wang] Mang memorialized, that the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-ch'eng should be honored with the title of [the Temple of] the Controlling Exemplar and the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing with the title of [the Temple of] the Primary Exemplar."

"At that time, the line of descent from Emperor Yüan had been ended, but of the great-grandsons of Emperor Hsüan there were living: five kings and forty-eight full marquises, [including] the Marquis of Kuang-chi, [Liu] Hsien. [Wang] Mang hated it that they were adults, so advised, "A cousin is not permitted to be the successor [to his cousin of the same generation]."

"So he selected the very youngest among [Emperor Hsüan's] great-great-grandsons, [Liu] Ying, the son of the Marquis of Kuang-chi, [Liu] Hsien. He was in the second year of his age. [Wang] Mang took as a pretext that when he was divined about and physiognomized, he was the most auspicious [of all]."

"In this month, the Displayer of Splendor in the South, Hsieh Hsiao, memorialized that the Chief of Wu-kung [prefecture], Meng T'ung, while a well was being dug, had secured a white stone, round above the square below, with red writing on the stone. The writing said, "An instruction to the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, that he should become the Emperor."

"The coming of mandates [from Heaven] through portents began indeed with this one."

"[Wang] Mang had the various highest ministers advise the [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang] of it. The [Grand] Empress Dowager said, "This [thing] is trumped up to deceive the empire. [Its message] cannot be put into practise."

"The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun, said to the [Grand] Empress Dowager that when matters have already reached such [a condition as they had], there was nothing that could be done [about it], that if she wished to check it, she did not have the strength to stop it; and also that [Wang] Mang would not presume to have any other [intentions], but merely desired to be entitled the Regent, in order to make his power greater and to settle the empire and make it obedient."

"The [Grand] Empress Dowager listened to him and promised [to do so]."

"[Wang] Shun and others thereupon together had the [Grand] Empress Dowager issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when `Heaven gave birth to' the crowd of `common people,' they were unable to govern themselves, so `He set up princes for them', in order to control them."

"When a prince is young, there must be someone whom he can rely upon, who should then act as regent. Then only will [the prince] be able to carry out [the duties] given him by Heaven and complete the transforming influence of Earth, so that the various living beings will flourish and be nurtured."

"Does not the Book of History say, `The work is Heaven's—let men take the place of [Heaven]'?"

"Because Emperor Hsiao-p'ing was young, We temporarily took charge of the government of the state. [We] hoped to put upon him the cap of maturity and to entrust the government to him and hand it over."

"But now his life has been cut short and he is dead. Alas! How sad!"

"[We] have already had the high officials summon twenty-three great-great-grandsons of Emperor Hsiao-hsüan, to choose an appropriate person to be the heir and successor of Emperor Hsiao-p'ing."

"This great-great-grandson is of the age when he is in swaddling clothes; if [We] are not able to secure [to be his regent] a princely man who has reached the very heart of virtue, who can give tranquillity to [the empire]?"

"The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, has assisted in the government for three reigns, has repeatedly met with critical times, has tranquillized and made brilliant the House of Han, and has thereupon made [people] of customs differing [from those of the Chinese become] like [the Chinese even] in their institutions, [so that] he has had the same presages as those had at a different age by the Duke of Chou."

"Now the Displayer of Splendor in the South, [Hsieh] Hsiao, and the Chief of Wu-kung [prefecture, Meng] T'ung, have presented [a memorial] speaking of a red stone portent. We have thought profoundly that its meaning, which said, `[Wang Mang] should become Emperor,' is however that as Regent he should perform the duties of the Emperor."

"Verily if there is a model, accomplishment is easy; [but] if there is no sage, there is no model."

"Let it be ordered that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should occupy [the post of] Regent and should [be permitted to] mount the eastern [master's] steps [at the altar to Heaven], as in the former case [was done by] the Duke of Chou. Let the prefecture of Wu-kung become the territory whose revenue is allocated to the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, and let its name be the town of Han-kuang (the Han [dynasty's] brilliance)."

"Let there be prepared a memorial concerning the ceremonial [for the above]."

"Thereupon the various courtiers memorialized, saying, "The sage virtue of the [Grand] Empress Dowager is brilliant. You have seen deeply into the intentions of Heaven and have issued an imperial order that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent."

"Your subjects have heard that when King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed, so that King Ch'eng was unable to perform his duties to Heaven and Earth and to renew the illustrious services [performed by Kings] Wen and Wu,"

"the Duke of Chou temporarily acted as Regent and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] were therefore completed and its kingly house was at peace. If he had not acted as Regent, then it is to be feared that the Chou [dynasty] would have lost the mandate of Heaven."

"The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou as] saying [to Prince Shih, the Duke of Shao], `If the son or grandson who becomes the heir to and serves our [lord, King Wu], should be altogether incapable of reverencing [the deities] above and below, [Heaven, Earth, the ancestors, and gods], and lose the glory of his predecessors, if we [were retired, living] at home, we would remain ignorant of it. The Mandate [of Heaven] is not easy [to retain], and the assistance of Heaven is not sure, so that His mandate may be lost.'"

"The explanation says, `The Duke of Chou wore the tasselled mortar-board bonnet of the Son of Heaven, faced south and held audience for the courtiers, and made proclamations and gave ordinances, constantly calling them the mandates of the King.'"

"The Duke of Shao was a worthy person, [but] did not understand the intentions of the sage, [the Duke of Chou], hence was not pleased.'"

"The [Record of] Proprieties (Li[chi]), in `Record of the Ming-t'ang,' says, `When the Duke of Chou held court for the nobles in the Ming-t'ang, [like] the Son of Heaven, he turned his back to the axe-embroidered screen, faced south, and stood up.'"

"It means that the Duke of Chou occupied the throne of the Son of Heaven to the sixth year, held court for the nobles, established the rites, and composed the music, so that the empire submitted widely."

"[But] the Duke of Shao was not pleased. At that time, King Wu had [just] died and the coarse mourning garments had not yet been put off."

"From this way of considering it, when the Duke of Chou first became Regent, he then occupied the Son of Heaven's throne and it was not [that he waited] until the sixth year [before] he mounted the eastern steps."

"The lost chapter of the Book of History, `Auspicious Grain,' says, `When the Duke of Chou offered the herb-flavored millet liquor, he stood upon the steps of the eastern staircase and was conducted to mount them, and the presentation speech [at the offering] said, "The Acting King is ruling over the government and diligently harmonizing the world."'"

"The [foregoing] is how the Duke of Chou was entitled by the person [who read] the presentation speech when [the Duke of Chou] was regent in the government."

"When King Ch'eng put on his cap of maturity, the Duke of Chou thereupon presented the government to him."

"The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou] as saying, `We return [the government to Our] nephew, the intelligent prince.' The Duke of Chou constantly called [his orders] the mandates of the King, and acted on his own authority without reporting [matters to the King], hence he said, `I return [the government] to my nephew, the intelligent prince.'"

"Your subjects beg that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent, mount the eastern steps, wear the apron and tasselled mortar-board hat of the Son of Heaven, turn his back to the axe-embroidered screen between the door and window, and face south as he holds court for the courtiers and attends to the business of government."

"When he goes in or out [of the Palace] in his chariot and robes, [the people] should be warned and [the streets] cleared. The common people and courtiers should call themselves his `subjects' or `female servants.' In all [these matters, he should be treated] as in the regulations for the Son of Heaven."

"When he makes the suburban sacrifices to Heaven and to Earth, makes the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar of the house in the Ming-t'ang, makes offerings and sacrifices in the [imperial] ancestral temples, and performs worship and makes sacrifices to the many gods, in his presentation speech he should be called, `the Acting Emperor.' The common people and courtiers should speak of him as `the Regent-Emperor'; he should call himself `I'."

"In judging and deciding matters [when holding] court, he should regularily employ the imperial edicts of the Emperor and pronounce [that he issues imperial] decrees, thereby upholding and obeying the will of August Heaven, assisting and protecting the House of Han, and guarding and tranquillizing the young heir to Emperor Hsiao-p'ing, [thus] carrying out the principle of entrusting [a Regent with the rule] and exalting the development of good government and peace."

"When he pays court at an audience of either the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] or the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], he should reassume the devotion of a subject."

"He should in his own person [as a noble] exercise the government and issue `instructions' to his own palace, his family, his [marquis's] estate, and his special territory [of Han-kuang], as in his previous practise, [according to] the legal practises of a noble."

"Your subjects, risking death, make this request." The edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager said, "It is approved."

"The next year, [Wang] Mang changed the year-period and called it Chü-shê (the Regency)."

"In [the year-period] Chü-shê, the first year, the first month, [Wang] Mang sacrificed to the Lords on High at the Southern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, welcomed the spring at the Eastern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, performed the rites of the great archery contest in the Ming-t'ang, and served food to Thrice Venerable and Fivefold Experienced. He completed the rites, then left."

"He established the Five Clerks At the Foot of the Court Steno Pillars, with their rank like that of the [Attendant] Secretaries. When he attended to government business, they attended at his side and recorded and made detailed accounts of his words and acts."

"In the third month, on [the day] chi-ch'ou, [Liu] Ying, a great-great-grandson of Emperor Hsüan, was set up as the Imperial Heir-apparent and was given the title, Young Prince (Ju-tzu)."

"Wang Shun was made Grand Tutor Assisting on the Left, Chen Feng was made Grand Support Aiding on the Right, and Chen Han was made Grand Guardian Serving at the Rear."

"There were also established four Junior [Coadjutors] whose ranks were all two thousand piculs."

"In the fourth month, the Marquis of An-chung, Liu Ch'ung, plotted with his Chancellor, Chang Shao, saying, "The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, acts on his own authority in holding court and exercizing the government, which will inevitably endanger the Liu clan."

"No one of those in the empire who disapprove of it has however dared to be the first to make a move. This is a shame to the [imperial] house."

"I will give an example to the [imperial] house and clan and be the first [to attack. All] within [the four] seas will certainly respond."

"[Chang] Shao and others, who followed him, [to the number of] more than a hundred persons, thereupon made an assault upon [the city of] Yüan, [but] did not succeed in entering it and were defeated."

"[Chang] Shao was a cousin of Chang Sung."

"[Chang] Sung, with [Liu] Ch'ung's father's cousin, Liu Chia, went to [the palace] portals and surrendered of their own accord, [so that Wang] Mang pardoned them and did not condemn them."

"Thereupon [Chang] Sung composed a memorial for [Liu] Chia, which said,"

"During [the year-periods] Chien-p'ing and Yüan-shou, when the main line [of the Han Dynasty] was in imminent danger of being cut short and the [imperial] house was in imminent danger of being overthrown,"

"thanks to your Majesty [Wang Mang's] sage virtue, you `crawled on your knees to rescue and save it,' you protected and defended, succored and guarded it, so that the [heavenly] mandate of the [Han] state was again prolonged and the imperial house opened its eyes [again]."

"When you attended court, controlled the government, put out proclamations, and put forth ordinances, in your every act you made the imperial house the first [and most important consideration] and the promotion and employment of the nine [sets of imperial] relatives as the primary matter."

"You have had included with them and recorded [upon the registers of the imperial house] cadet branches [of that house] and have established kings and marquises [from among these cadet branches], so that those who face south [in holding court and call themselves by the designation a noble uses for himself], ku, are numbered by the hundreds."

"You gathered in and restored those members whose [registration in the imperial house] had been broken off, you preserved those [whose lines of descent as nobles] had died out, and you continued [those lines whose heads] had been dismissed [from their noble ranks], so that they form a numerous company who are able to be shoulder to shoulder and head to head [with the other nobles] and have been restored in their persons. You have thereby defended the Han [dynasty's] state and supported the Han clan."

"You have established the Pi-yung and set up the Ming-t'ang to propagate the law of Heaven and to spread the influence of the sages. You have held court for the various princes in order to render your `culture and virtue' manifest. You have added to the lands and territory of all the nobles in the imperial house,"

"so that all under Heaven lift up their heads, stick out their necks and sigh [with approval], and the sound of their praises is `magnificent and ear'-filling, and enters [the sense of hearing]."

"The reason that the state has gained this beauty, has obtained this fame, has enjoyed these blessings, and has received this glory—is it not [the result of the fact that] the Grand Empress Dowager considers [that she must be diligent until] `sundown' and that `in the evening' your Majesty is still `carefully' contemplating [your duties]? How [otherwise could it be] explained?"

"When there has been disorder, you have controlled it; when there has been danger, you have turned it to tranquillity; when there has been calamity, you have led it to happiness; when [lines of descent] have been cut off, you have continued their succession, when [the Emperor] is young, you have taken his place and borne his burdens. Day and night, you have performed detailed labor; in cold and in heat, you have been diligent, without any time for relaxation, with unending unwearied effort. All was for the sake of the empire and to favor the Liu clan."

"The courtiers, whether stupid or wise, and the common people, whether male or female, have all understood your high intentions."

"But the Marquis of An-chung, [Liu] Ch'ung, alone entertained perverse illusions in his heart and held rebellious thoughts, so that he raised his troops and moved the multitude, intending to endanger the imperial [ancestral] temples. Of his wickedness one cannot endure to hear and for his crime one cannot be patient with [mere] execution. Verily, he was an enemy of [loyal] subjects and [filial] sons, a foe of the imperial house, a rebel against the state, and an injury to the country."

"For this reason, his clan and relatives by marriage quaked, became distant to him and gave information of his crimes; the common people dispersed, rebelled against him, and threw away their arms, so that in advancing he could not [take] a step and when he retired he suffered the calamity [visited upon] him [by Heaven]."

"His mother, who was near the end of her life, and his smiling babes, carried in [their nurses'] arms, were beheaded at the same time with him; their heads were hung on the ends of poles with their pearl earrings [still] in their ears and their hair ornaments still on [their heads]. How can it not be perverse to make a plan such as this?"

"Your servant has heard that anciently, when [the head of] a rebellious state had already been punished, then they made a pool out of his palace-buildings, making them a stagnant pond, and put filth into it, calling its name, `The baleful waste,' so that, although it might grow vegetables, yet people would not eat them."

"They put four walls [around] its mound to the gods of the soils, covered it above, and put a mat [on it] below, so that spirits of the earth could not communicate [with those of heaven."

"The soil of] its mound was distributed to the nobles' [altars for the gods of the soils], so that when they went out of their gates and saw it, it would be visible to them as a warning."

"Just now, when the empire heard that [Liu] Ch'ung rebelled, all wanted to raise up [the skirts of] their robes, [take] a two-edged sword in their hand, and rail at him."

"Those who first reached him, cut his throat, struck his breast, pierced his body, and hacked his flesh."

"Those who came later wanted to pull down his gates, break down his walls, raze his houses, and burn his utensils. [As rapidly as] an echo follows a sound, [their blood] stained the earth, so immediately was a wound created [in people's feelings]."

"The [members of] the imperial house moreover [felt it] especially keenly, so that, when they spoke of him, they inevitably gnashed their teeth."

"Why so? Because he had gone contrary to and rebelled against your favor and beneficence and did not recognize where the greatest virtue lay."

"The [members of] the imperial house, for the most part, live at places distant [from Yüan]; I, Chia, have been fortunate to have been able to hear of [his rebellion] first and have not [been able] to resist my indignant desire. I wish to take the lead of the imperial house, myself, [with] my sons and my elder and younger brothers, to carry baskets on our shoulders and to bear mattocks, gallop to Nan-yang [Commandery], and make a pond of [Liu] Ch'ung's palace-buildings, in order to cause them to be according to the ancient institutions."

"They, together with the mound to the gods of the soils belonging to [Liu] Ch'ung, should be like the mound to the gods of the soils at Po, and should be used to grant to the nobles, in order that it may be an eternal lesson and warning."

"I wish that [this matter] may be referred to the Four Coadjutors, the ministers, and the grandees, for discussion, in order to make plain its right and wrong and to show it [as an example] to the four quarters [of the empire]."

"[Wang] Mang was thereupon very much pleased."

"The ministers all said, "It would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Chia says,"

[so Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, which said, "Verily, although [Liu] Chia, a father and his sons, his elder and younger brothers, are related to [Liu] Ch'ung, they did not presume to show partiality to him. Whenever they saw some sprouts [of evil], they led each other in giving information [about it]. Now that this calamity [of rebellion] has come to pass, they unanimously and together [want to] take vengeance upon him. [Their act is] a response to ancient institutions, so that their loyalty and filial devotion is apparent."

"Let [Liu] Chia be enfeoffed with a thousand households of [the prefecture] of Tu-yen, as the Marquis Leading by the Rules of Proper Conduct, and [let Liu] Chia's seven sons be all granted the noble rank of Marquises of the Imperial Domain."

"Later [Chang] Sung was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Pure Virtue."

"In Ch'ang-an there was a saying about him, which said,"If you seek enfeoffment,Go to Chang [Sung] Po-sung.Strength in fightingIs not as good as cleverness in preparing memorials."

[Wang] Mang also enfeoffed more than a hundred officials and common people of Nan-yang [Commandery] who had distinguished themselves. He made a stagnant pond of Liu Ch'ung's residence.

"People who later plotted to rebel all had stagnant ponds [made out of their residences]."

"The various courtiers furthermore advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] that Liu Ch'ung and the others had plotted treason because [Wang] Mang's power was too light,"

"and that it would be proper to honor and make him more powerful in order that he might control [all] within [the four] seas."

"In the fifth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en, the [Grand] Empress Dowager issued an imperial edict that when [Wang] Mang comes to a court audience of the [Grand] Empress Dowager, he should be called the Acting Emperor."

"In the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] ping-ch'en, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun."

"In the twelfth month, various courtiers memorialized, begging to increase the officials in the palace and in the home of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], to establish a Chief Leader of Conscripts, Chiefs and Assistants in his Temple, Stable, and Kitchen, Palace Bodyguards, [Gentlemen] As Rapid as Tigers, and those of lower [rank, to the number of] more than a hundred persons, and also establish Guards [for him to the number of] three hundred persons."

"The rooms, [in the imperial palace], of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should be [called] the Regent's Apartments; his yamen should be [called the Regent's Hall; and his residence should be [called] the Regent's Palace. The memorial was approved."

"[Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily when the late Grand Master, [K'ung] Kuang, died previously, his achievements were already made known."

"The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun, the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen] Feng, the General of Light Chariots, [Chen] Han, and the General of Foot-soldiers, [Sun] Chien, all formed plans for inducing the Shan-yü [to adopt Chinese customs]. They also had charge of the Spiritual Tower, the Ming-t'ang, the Pi-yung, and the four [altars for] the suburban sacrifices, and fixed their institutions and regulations. They opened up the Tzu-wu Road, were of the same mind with the Ruling Governor in delighting in virtue, and were in accord with his ideas and of mutual assistance to him, so that their achievements and virtuous conduct are abundant and apparent."

"[We] enfeoff the sons of [Wang] Shun: [Wang] K'uang as the Marquis of the Same Mind [with the Ruling Governor] and [Wang] Lin as the Marquis Delighting in Virtue; [K'ung] Kuang's grandson, [K'ung] Shou, as the Marquis of Accordance of Ideas; [Chen] Feng's grandson, [Chen] K'uang, as the Marquis of Mutual Assistance; and add [to the enfeoffments of Chen] Han and of [Sun] Chien, to each [the income of] three thousand households."

"and add [to the enfeoffments of Chen] Han and of [Sun] Chien, to each [the income of] three thousand households."

"In this year, P'ang T'ien, Fu Fan, and others of the Western Ch'iang, who had held a grudge [because Wang] Mang had taken away their land and made of it the commandery of Hsi-hai, rebelled and attacked the Grand Administrator of Hsi-hai [Commandery], Ch'eng Yung. [Ch'eng] Yung fled hastily,"

[so Wang] Mang executed [Ch'eng] Yung and sent the Colonel Commissioner for the Ch'iang, Tou K'uang, to attack [the Ch'iang]."

"In the second year, in the spring, Tou K'uang and others attacked and routed the Western Ch'iang."

"In the fifth month, [Wang] Mang changed [the coinage] and created as [objects of] exchange, [gold] inlaid knife [coins] (ts'o-tao), one of which was worth five thousand [cash], graving knife [coins] (ch'i-tao), one of which was worth five hundred [cash], and large cash (ta-ch'ien), one of which was worth fifty [cash]. Together with the [previous] five-shu cash, [all of them were to] circulate together."

"Many common people cast counterfeit [money]."

"Full marquises and those of lower [rank] were not permitted to possess actual gold; they were to transport it to the Imperial Wardrobe, to receive its value [in money]. Yet in the end he did not give them its value."

"In the ninth month, the Grand Administrator of Tung Commandery, Chai Yi, held his [annual] general [military review and] examinations, led [out] his chariots and cavalry, and made use of this occasion to mobilize emergency troops. He set up the Marquis of Yen-hsiang, Liu Hsin, as the Son of Heaven, and sent a call-to-arms to the commanderies and kingdoms, saying, "[Wang] Mang murdered Emperor P'ing by poison and, as Regent, [has taken to himself] the throne of the Son of Heaven, intending to cut short [the reign of] the House of Han. Now we should respectfully inflict the punishment of Heaven and execute [Wang] Mang."

"The commanderies and kingdoms he caused a crowd of more than a hundred thousand [persons] to doubt and suspect [Wang Mang]."

"[Wang] Mang was frightened and afraid and could not eat. Day and night he held the Young Prince, [Liu Ying], in his arms. He gave information [to the gods] in prayers at [the altars for] the suburban sacrifices and at [the imperial ancestral] temples. He made a document after the model of the "Great Announcement," and sent the Grandee-remonstrant Huan T'an and others to publish it in the empire and to proclaim the idea that, since [Wang Mang] had [only] the post of regent, he would be obliged to return the government [in due time] to the Young Prince."

"遣王邑、孙建等八将军击义，分屯诸关，守厄塞。"

"槐里男子赵明、霍鸿等起兵，以和翟义，相与谋曰：“诸将精兵悉东，京师空，可攻长安。”"

"众稍多，至且十万人，莽恐，遣将军王奇、王级将兵拒之。"

"以太保甄邯为大将军，受钺高庙，领天下兵，左杖节，右把钺，屯城外。"

"王舜、甄丰昼夜循行殿中。"

"十二月，王邑等破翟义于圉。"

"司威陈崇使监军上书言：“陛下奉天洪范，心合宝龟，膺受元命，豫知成败，咸应兆占，是谓配天。"

"配天之主，虑则移气，言则动物，施则成化。"

"臣崇伏读诏书下日，窃计其时，圣思始发，而反虏仍破；诏文始书，反贼大败；制书始下，反贼毕斩，众将未及齐其锋芒，臣崇未及尽共愚虑，而事已决矣。”"

"[Wang] Mang was greatly pleased."

"In the third year, in the spring, there was an earthquake, and a general amnesty [was granted] to the empire."

"Wang Yi and the others returned to the imperial capital and went west to join with Wang Chi and the others to attack [Chao] Ming and [Ho] Hung, who were all routed and annihilated. A discussion is in the "Memoir of Chai Yi.""

"[Wang] Mang held a great banquet in the White Tiger Hall of the Wei-yang Palace to make grants to the generals and leaders for their toil. In an imperial edict, [he ordered] Ch'en Ch'ung to examine and estimate the military achievements [of the leaders] and rank them as high or low."

"[Wang] Mang then sent [to the Grand Empress Dowager] a memorial which said, "In an age of brilliant sages, there are many capable persons in the state, hence at the time of T'ang [Yao] and Yü [Shun], in every house [someone] was capable of being enfeoffed and when their meritorious services had been performed and their work had been done, rewards were given."

"At the time of the assembly [called by] the Sovereign of the Hsia [dynasty, Yü,] at T'u-shan, those who held jade and silk [at the ceremonies, belonged to] ten thousand states. (The nobles held jade and their sub-vassals held silk.)"

"[In the time of] King Wu of the Chou [dynasty, at the assembly] above the Meng Ford, there were still eight hundred nobles."

"When the Duke of Chou occupied [the post] of Regent, he performed the suburban sacrifice to Prince Millet as the coadjutor of Heaven and performed in the Ming-t'ang the ancestral sacrifice to the greatest exemplar, to King Wen, as the coadjutor of the Lord on High. For this reason, when, within the four seas, each person came to [assist in] the sacrifice in accordance with his duty, there were indeed probably 1800 nobles."

"The Record of Proprieties (Li-chi), [in the chapter,] `The Royal Regulations,' [speaks of] more than seventeen hundred states. For this reason, when Confucius composed the Classic of Filial Piety, he said, `[anciently, the brilliant kings] did not presume to neglect the ministers of [even] small states—then how much more dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons! Hence they brought it about that the myriad states rejoiced in heart and therefore served [the King's] deceased predecessors.' The foregoing [was the result of] the Son of Heaven's filial piety."

"The Ch'in [dynasty] acted contrary to the [right] way, killing the nobles and exterminating their clans, making [their territories] into commanderies and prefectures, with the intention of arrogating to itself [all] the benefits of the whole country. Hence [in the reign of] the Second Emperor, it fell"

"and Emperor Kao received the mandate [of Heaven] to do away with [the Ch'in dynasty's] oppression. He examined [his subjects'] merits, distributed rewards, and established several hundred [kings' and marquises'] states. Later they declined considerably [in number] and the remainder have barely preserved [their noble ranks]."

"太皇太后躬统大纲，广封功德以劝善，兴灭继绝以永世，是以大化流通，旦暮且成。"

"It happened that, when the Ch'iang malefactors injured Hsi-hai Commandery, when rebellious caitiffs spread lying words in Tung Commandery, and when treasonable robbers misled the crowd [even] in the land west [of the imperial capital], no loyal subjects or filial sons failed to become angry, so that those against whom they made expeditions have been extirpated and have all suffered for their crimes, with the result that the empire is altogether peaceful."

"I have been instituting rites and composing music, and have verified by investigation that there is an explicit written statement [to the effect that] the noble ranks of the Chou [period] were of five grades and that their lands were of four grades, and that there is the saying but no written statement that the noble ranks of the Yin [period] were of three grades."

"Confucius said, `The Chou [dynasty] surveyed the two [preceding] dynasties. How replete was its culture! I follow the Chou [dynasty].'"

"Your subject begs that the various leaders who ought to receive noble ranks and estates should [be granted] noble ranks of five grades and lands of four grades." The memorial was approved.

"Thereupon the highest of those who were enfeoffed were made marquises and earls; the next were made viscounts and barons; those who would have been granted the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain [had their nobilities] changed and were entitled Sub-vassals. Altogether there were several hundreds [of people enfeoffed]."

"Those who had attacked [the rebels in] Hsi-hai [Commandery] had [the word] Ch'iang used in their titles, [those who had attacked the rebels in] Huai-li had [the word] Wu (military) used in their titles; [those who had attacked] Chai Yi [had the word] caitiff (lu) used in their titles."

"The courtiers again memorialized, saying, "Of the persons whose merits the [Grand] Empress Dowager has embellished and whose virtue she has recorded, the greatest ones [will be remembered for] a thousand years, and the lesser ones for the present generation. Some were enfeoffed for civil [deeds] and some received noble ranks for military [acts]. None, [whether their merits were] deep or shallow, great or small, have failed to be presented [for rewards]."

"Now the Regent-Emperor, [Wang] Mang, turns his back to the screen and mounts the eastern steps, so that it is proper that he should be [treated] differently from at the time when he was [merely] the chief minister of the state. Although his instituting [of regulations] and composing [of music and dances] has not yet been all completed, it is proper that the noble ranks of his two sons should be advanced and that both should be made dukes."

"[According to the principle of] the Spring and Autumn [in the Kung-yang Commentary], that `treating well the good should be extended to their sons and grandsons and [treating well] the worthy to' their descendants, it is proper that [these persons] should possess lands and territory."

"King Ch'eng gave broad enfeoffments to the sons of the Duke of Chou by concubines, so that all his six sons had soil enveloped in quitch-grass [as a token of their enfeoffment]."

"So the relatives of the famous Chancellor [of State] and of [the famous] General-in-chief of the Han dynasty, Hsiao [Ho] and Ho [Kuang, respectively,] were all [enfeoffed] together with their relatives and connections."

"[Wang Mang's] elder brother's son, [Wang] Kuang, might first be enfeoffed as a full marquis. When the institutions and regulations are all completed, the Grand Minister over the Masses and the Grand Minister of Works should present the names of [Wang Mang's various grandsons] to the throne in accordance with the previous written imperial edict."

"The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "[We] promote the sons of the Regent-Emperor: the Marquis in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu], [Wang] An, to be the Duke Recommended by [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu]; and the Marquis in Reward to [the Marquis of Hsin-] tu, [Wang] Lin, to be the Duke in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin [-tu]; and enfeoff [Wang] Kuang as the Marquis of Vast Merit.""

"At this time, [Wang] Mang returned his state of Hsin-tu, so various courtiers again advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] and she enfeoffed [Wang] Mang's grandson, [Wang] Tsung, as the Marquis of Hsin-tu."

"Since [Wang] Mang had annihilated Chai Yi, he himself considered that his majesty and virtue was increasing daily and that he had secured the assistance of Heaven and of men, so he plotted to ascend [the throne] as the actual [Emperor]."

"In the ninth month, [Wang] Mang's mother, the Baronetess of Apparent Merits, died. [Wang Mang's] mind was not upon mourning, so he had the [Grand] Empress Dowager issue an imperial edict [ordering] the discussion of [what] mourning garments [should be worn]."

"The Junior Supporter, the Hsi-and-Ho, Liu Hsin, with the Erudits and Confucians [to the number of] 78 persons [altogether], all said,"The principle of acting as Regent is to direct the performance of the duties established by Heaven, to promote the reverencing of the way of [the ancient Sage]-lords, to bring to a successful issue the laws and regulations, and to make tranquil and concordant [all] within [the four] seas."

"Anciently, when T'ang the Victorious of the Yin [dynasty,即商汤] had died and his Heir-apparent had died in his youth, his son T'ai-chia was a minor and unintelligent, so Yi Yin banished him to the T'ung Palace and acted as Regent in order to promote the course of the Yin [dynasty,即商朝]."

"When King Wu of the Chou [dynasty] had died, the ways of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed and `King Ch'eng was young' and a minor, `so the Duke of Chou protected King Ch'eng' and acted as Regent in order to perfect the ways of the Chou [dynasty]."

"For this reason the Yin [dynasty] had the development of being`orderly' and the Chou [dynasty] had the merit of establishing but not employing the mutilating punishments."

"Now the Grand Empress Dowager has frequently`happened upon untoward circumstances in the state,' and has commissioned the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to rule and control the various officials, and to govern the empire justly."

"It has happened that since the Young Prince is a minor and has not yet been able to be diligently respectful to [the gods] above and below, August Heaven has sent down auspicious presages and has produced the portent of the red stone. For this reason, the Grand Empress Dowager followed the plain mandate of Heaven and issued an imperial edict that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent and mount the eastern steps in order that he might perform the duties of the sage Han [dynasty] and make it equally eminent with that of T'ang [Yao], Yü [Shun], and the three dynasties."

"The Regent-Emperor thereupon opened his private yamen and met with various Confucians to institute rites and compose [the proper] music, to assist in fixing the [titles of] the many offices, and to complete beautifully the work of Heaven."

"His sage mind is in all respects complete, and eminent are his individual insights. The Chou Rites (the Chou-li) was discovered and secured, so that it was made plain what should be followed' and surveyed'. He took Heaven as his model and searched out ancient ways, yet modified them. It was just as when [K'ung Ch'iu] Chung-ni heard [the music] Shao, and [just as] the sun and moon' cannot [be climbed up to by any] stairs.' If [Wang Mang] had not the utmost of sage wisdom, how could he have been able to perform these [deeds]?"

"The fundamental and subordinate principles [of government] are all displayed and completed [except for] one basketful. These [matters] are the means by which he has devoted himself to protecting and assisting the sage Han [dynasty] and giving tranquillity to the great multitude."

"Now the Baronetess of Apparent Merits has died. The [Ceremonies and] Rites [Yi]-li [says],`The son of a concubine who becomes the heir [of his father] wears the three-month's szu mourning for his own mother,'"

"and the explanation says,`He is in the same position as the most honorable person [in the family, i.e., his father, and so] should not presume to wear [deep] mourning for his own mother.'"

"The Regent-Emperor has, through his sage virtue, obtained the mandate of August Heaven, received the imperial edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager that he should act as Regent and mount the eastern steps, and support the descendant of the great Han imperial family. On the one hand, he has his weighty [duties] to Heaven, Earth, and the gods of the soils and the grains, and on the other hand, he has the care of the great multitude and the multifarious matters [of the government], so that he is not permitted to consider his own relatives."

"Hence the Grand Empress Dowager has established his eldest grandson [as a noble], causing him to be the marquis at Hsin-tu and the successor to Marquis Ai, [Wang Wan], making plain that the Regent-Emperor is in the same position as the most honorable person, [the Emperor],"

"upholds the sacrifices at [imperial] ancestral temples, is in charge of supplying the needs of the Grand Empress Dowager, and is not permitted to wear mourning for his own parents."

"The Chou Rites (Chou-li) says, A king, . . . [in wearing mourning] for his nobles, [wears] the hemp mourning badge and cap,' to which there is added a ring of hemp banding.' If [the nobles] are of the same surname [as the king], then [his mourning gar ments] are of hemp (Cannabis); if they are of a different surname, then they are of ke hemp (Pueraria)."

"The Regent-Emperor ought to wear the hemp mourning badge for the Baronetess of Apparent Merits and a cap to which there has been added a hemp ring of banding, like the mourning garments of the Son of Heaven in condoling his nobles, in order to respond to the institutions of the sages."

"[Wang] Mang therefore acted [accordingly]. Altogether he paid one mourning [visit] and a second [time] assembled [the mourners] and ordered the Marquis of Hsin-tu, [Wang] Tsung, to be in charge [of the ceremonies] and wear mourning to the third year."

"The Director of Majesty, Ch'en Ch'ung, memorialized that the Marquis of Vast Merit, [Wang] Kuang, had secretly sent a message to the Bearer of the Gilded Mace, Tou K'uang, and had ordered him to kill a man, and that for this reason [Tou] K'uang had arrested and bound [this person] and had applied the law to him."

"[Wang] Mang was furious and bitterly reproached [Wang] Kuang."

"[Wang] Kuang's mother said [to her son],"Do you yourself consider in what way [you are any different from Wang Yü] Chang-sun or [Wang Huo] Chung-sun, [Wang Mang's dead sons]?"

"Thereupon [both of them], mother and son, committed suicide; together with [Tou] K'uang they all died."

"Previously, because [Wang] Mang had served his mother, had nourished his elder brother's wife, and had raised his elder brother's son, [Wang Kuang], he had made a name [for himself]. Then later, his perversity and cruelty were again used to show [that he was actuated by] public spirit and sense of duty."

"He ordered [Wang] Kuang's son, [Wang] Chia, to inherit [his father's] noble rank and become the Marquis [of Vast Merits]."

"[Wang] Mang issued a written message, which said,"The principle of `stopping and hushing [instruments' as a sign of mourning for the Emperor] will end with the last month of [this] winter. In the first month [of the next year], at the suburban sacrifices, the eight [kinds of] musical instruments should be played."

"Altogether how many grades of music [should be played by their own musicians] for the kings, ministers, and gentlemen? For each of the several ranks, what should be the number of the five [kinds of] notes and the eight [kinds of] musical instruments?"

"Let [the proper officials] with the Confucian Masters under their control each employ their spirits and minds to the utmost and set forth their ideas completely."

"In this year, Liu Ching, the Marquis of Kuang-jao, Hu Yün, a Millenary of the General of Chariots and Cavalry, and Tsang Hung, a subordinate of the Grand Guardian, memorialized mandates [from Heaven through] portents."

"[Liu] Ching spoke of the new well in Ch'i Commandery, [Hu] Yün spoke of the stone ox in Pa Commandery and [Tsang] Hung spoke of the stone at Yung in the [Yu]-fu-feng [Commandery. Wang] Mang welcomed and accepted all [of them],"

"and in the eleventh month, on [the day] chia-tzu, [Wang] Mang presented a memorial to the [Grand] Empress Dowager, which said,"

"When your Majesty with your extreme sagacity `happened upon untoward circumstances in the state,' and met with the dangers [at the end of] the twelve reigns of the Han [dynasty, at the end of] the three [times] seven [decades of years], you received a majestic mandate from Heaven, and issued an imperial mandate that I, your servant Mang, should act as Regent, should receive the care of the Young Prince, and should be entrusted with the charge of the empire."

"Your servant Mang was careful and vigilant, fearing lest I would be unworthy."

"[A member of] the imperial house, the Marquis of Kuang-jao, Liu Ching, has sent to the throne a letter saying,

"In the eleventh month, on [the day] jen-tzu, [which was a day] for establishing, and was the winter solstice, the stone ox from the Pa Commandery [arrived] and, on [the day] mou-wu, the inscription on the stone at Yung arrived at the Front Hall of the Wei-yang Palace."

"When your servant, with the Grand Guardian, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun, and others were looking at them, a wind arose from Heaven and dust obscured things. When the wind ceased, we obtained a copper portent and a silk design from in front of the stone. Its text reads,

"A Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Ts'ui Fa, and others looked at it and explained it."

"Moreover previously, in [the reign of] Emperor Hsiao-ai, in [the year-period] Chien-p'ing, the second year, the sixth month, on [the day] chia-tzu, [the Emperor] issued a written imperial edict changing [the year-period] and making it the first year of [the period] T'ai-ch'u-yüan-chiang. When the source of this [matter] is examined, [it is found to be] the books of revelation by Kan Chung-k'o and Hsia Ho-liang, which have been stored in the Orchid Terrace."

"Your servant Mang considers that the words, `the first year of [T'ai-ch'u]-yüan-chiang (great general)' [mean that] when `the General (Chiang)-in-chief acts as Regent, he will change the year-period (yüan),' which is a testimony for the present [time]."

"The Book of History, [in the chapter], `The Announcement to the King's Uncle of K'ang,' [says], `[The Acting] King, [the Duke of Chou], speaks in the following fashion, "The chief of the nobles, Our younger brother, my little one, Feng, [the King's Uncle of K'ang]." '[The foregoing words [show that] the Duke of Chou, when acting as Regent, was entitled King."

"In the Spring and Autumn, it is not said that Duke Yin ascended the throne, because he was Regent."

"These two Classics were those fixed by the Duke of Chou and Confucius, indeed to be a model for later [generations]."

"Confucius said, `[The superior man] fears the Mandate of Heaven, fears the great, and fears the precepts of the Sages.' "

"[How can] your servant Mang presume not to obey?"

"Your servant begs that in respectfully serving the gods in heaven and earth, in the [imperial] ancestral temples, and in memorializing the Grand Empress Dowager and the Empress [nee Wang] of [Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing, he may call himself `the Acting Emperor,' "

"[but that] when he gives proclamations or ordinances to the empire or when [anyone in] the empire memorializes him about matters, they should not use [the words] `Regent' [i.e., should merely say, `Emperor'];"

"that the third year of [the period] Chü-shê should become the first year of [the period] Ch'u-shih, and that 120 gradations on the clepsydra [in a day] should be the rule, which should be used to respond to the Mandate of Heaven."

"Your servant Mang will day and night rear and raise the Young Prince and bring it about that he will be equal in virtue with King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] and [thus] spread abroad the majesty and virtue of the Grand Empress Dowager to all quarters, hoping to `enrich and then teach [the people]."

"When the Young Prince is capped, I will `return [the government] to the intelligent prince,' as in the former circumstance the Duke of Chou did."

"The memorial was approved."

"The mass of commoners knew [what was Wang Mang's] motive in receiving respectfully the mandate [given through] the portents. The courtiers discussed it extensively and memorialized separately in order to indicate the gradual [steps] by which he should take [the throne as] the actual [Emperor]."

"A Gentleman Attendant at the Gate, Chang Ch'ung, and others, six persons [in all], plotted together to abduct [Wang] Mang and set up the King of Ch'u, [Liu Yü, as Emperor, but the plot] became known and they were executed and died."

"Ai Chang, a man of Tzu-t'ung, had been doing elementary studying in Ch'ang-an. Heretofore he had no distinction but loved to boast."

"When he saw that [Wang] Mang was acting as Regent, he immediately made a bronze casket with two envelop covers. He wrote on one of them, "The design in the metal casket [with] the Seal of the Lord of Heaven's Act." On the other he wrote, "The written metal charter [with] the Seal of the Red Lord's Act, which a certain person transmits to the Yellow Emperor, [Wang Mang."

"(Instead of] "certain person" [there was written Pang], the personal name of Emperor Kao)."

"The writing said that Wang Mang should be the actual Son of Heaven and the [Grand] Empress Dowager [should act] according to the mandate of Heaven."

"Both on the design and the writing were written [the names of] eight persons who were [Wang] Mang's high officials. It also named two fine names, Wang Hsing (Wang Rises) and Wang Sheng (Wang Prospers); [Ai] Chang, taking advantage [of this opportunity, also] inserted his own surname and personal name amongst [them, so that] altogether there were eleven persons. For all of them there were written official [titles] and noble ranks as [Wang Mang's] coadjutors and assistants."

"When [Ai] Chang heard that the matters of the well in Ch'i [Commandery] and of the stone ox had been referred [to the officials], on that very day, at dusk, he put on yellow clothes, took the casket, went to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, and thereupon delivered it to the Supervisor [of the Temple]."

"The Supervisor thereupon reported it."

"On [the day] mou-ch'en, [Wang] Mang went to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, bowed, and received the metal casket and the resignation [of the Han dynasty, which] the gods had [commanded]."

"Wearing the royal hat, he visited the [Grand] Empress Dowager, returned, seated himself in the Front Hall of the Wei-yang Palace, and issued a written message, which said:"

"I possess no virtue, [but] I rely upon [the fact that] I am a descendant of my august deceased original ancestor, the Yellow Lord, and a distant descendant of my august deceased first ancestor, the Lord of Yü, [Shun], and the least of the Grand Empress Dowager's relatives."

"August Heaven and the Lords on High have made abundantly apparent their great assistance, so that the mandate [of Heaven] has been completed and the succession [to the imperial rule] has been set in order. By portents and credentials, designs and writings, a metal casket and a written charter, the gods have proclaimed that they entrust me with the myriad common people of the empire."

"The Red Lord is the genius of Emperor Kao of the Han dynasty. He has received a mandate from Heaven and has transmitted the state [to me by] a writing on a metal charter. I have been extremely reverent and awed—[how could I] presume not to receive it respectfully?"

"On [the day] mou-ch'en, which is a day for founding, I wear the royal hat and ascend the throne as the actual Son of Heaven.

"Let there be a change in the first day of the first month, an alternation in the colors of the [court] robes, a variation in the sacrifical victims, a difference in the standards and pennons, and a diversity in the utensils and institutions."

"Let the first day of the twelfth month, [the day] kuei-yu, become the first day of the first month in the first year of [the year-period Shih]-chien-kuo, and let the crowing of the cock be the hour."

"The colors of robes shall match the virtue [of the ruling element, earth, so that] yellow shall be esteemed. The sacrificial victims shall correspond to the first month, and so shall be white. The pennons and banners of commissioners' credentials shall all be made pure yellow.
